Russell\u201d\nRussell J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 1\nDate: January 6, 2023\nDocket: 2020-2467(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nLIN L. KEEHN,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nRussell J.\n[1] The appellant, Mr. Lin L. Keehn, appeals a reassessment raised February 27, 2020 under the federal Income Tax Act (Act) pertaining to his 2018 taxation year. It reflects denial by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) that $853 that Mr. Keehn\u2019s spouse had paid in 2018 for hospital parking constituted a \u201cmedical expense\u201d pursuant to section 118.2 of the Act. The Minister thus excluded this amount from calculation of the balance of the medical expense tax credit (METC) that the Minister found Mr. Keehn was entitled to for his 2018 taxation year.\n[2] Mr. Keehn in his Notice of Appeal pleads:\nMy wife has to park to obtain dialysis incurring parking expenses. The subsection 118.2(2) specifies traveling over 80 km and has nothing to do with parking. Does not specifically exclude nor include parking. Parking is not an act of driving. It is in fact not driving. It discriminates against people who have to travel less than 80 km for necessary medical treatment.\n[3] At the hearing Mr. Keehn testified. It was helpful to hear from him regardless that essentially there was no dispute as to the facts. The essential fact is that during the 2018 taxation year Mr. Keehn\u2019s spouse received, three times per week, kidney dialysis treatment at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton. Typically Mrs. Keehn would drive from her home to the hospital where she would park the car, and then upon completion of her treatment session drive back home. Her home was approximately 22 kilometres from the hospital.\n[4] Mr. Keehn testified that these dialysis treatments were life-saving and without same his spouse would have died. He equated the parking expense to a medical treatment expense. She needed to be able to park her car to receive treatments. As said the total of claimed parking expenses for the 2018 taxation year was $853. The Minister allowed other expenses as medical expenses totaling $6,342 for Mr. Keehn\u2019s 2018 taxation year.\n[5] Mr. Keehn also testified that his spouse was a retired nurse and she had spent much of her nursing career working at this same hospital.\n[6] The Minister\u2019s denial of the parking cost as a medical expense is based on subsection 118.2(2) of the Act which sets out what are \u201cmedical expenses\u201d for purposes of calculating the amount of a MRTC per subsection 118.2(1).\n[7] As noted, Mr. Keehn pleaded in his Notice of Appeal that the Act discriminates as to \u201creasonable travel expenses\u201d thereby including parking expenses, insofar as allowing inclusion of such expenses only for individuals required to travel not less than 80 kilometres (one way) for necessary medical treatment.\n[8] Paragraphs 118.2(2)(g) and (h) of the Act provide:\n(2) [Medical expenses] For the purposes of subsection (1), a medical expense of an individual is an amount paid\n(g) to a person engaged in the business of providing transportation services, to the extent that the payment is made for the transportation of\n(i) the patient, and\n(ii) one individual who accompanied the patient, where the patient was, and has been certified in writing by a medical practitioner to be, in capable of traveling, without the assistance of an attendant\nfrom the locality, where the patient dwells to a place, not less than 40 km from that locality, where medical services are normally provided, or from that place to that locality, if\n(iii) substantially equivalent, medical services are not available in that locality,\n(iv) the route travelled by the patient is, having regard to the circumstances, a reasonably direct route, and\n(v) the patient travels to the place to obtain medical services for himself or herself, and it is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances, for the patient to travel to that place, to obtain those services;\n(h) for reasonable travel expenses (other than expenses described in paragraph (g)) incurred in respect of the patient and, where the patient was, and has been certified in writing by a medical practitioner to be, incapable of travelling, without the assistance of an attendant, in respect of one individual who accompanied the patient, to obtain medical services in a place that is not less than 80 km from the locality, where the patient dwells if the circumstances described in subparagraphs (g)(iii) to (v) apply;\n[9] Paragraph 118.2(2)(h) of the Act, which makes a distinction for one way travel distances of not less than 80 km, applies equally to any and all individuals seeking to claim a METC.\n[10] Discrimination is addressed in subsection 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Constitution Act, 1982). That provision provides, under the heading \u201cEquality Rights\u201d:\n15(1) [Equality before and under law, and equal protection and benefit of law] Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n[11] But, this is not a case where for any given law, here paragraph 118.2(2)(h), there is discrimination as between individuals in the expression or application of that law. While that provision expresses a limitation of not less than 80 km, that limitation is not based on, or to be applied on the basis of, differences of individuals themselves. Rather, it is applied on the basis of whether any given individual had not less than an 80 km one way distance to travel. Here, Mrs. Keehn had a one way distance of only 22 km to travel.\n[12] Parliament chooses to recognize as a medical expenses hospital parking costs (being part of \u201creasonable travel expenses\u201d) for one way travel of not less than 80 km. But that does not mean Parliament is discriminating by not granting the same recognition for parking costs for one way travel of any lesser distance. Parliament is entitled to make such distinctions in the Act, such as in protecting the fisc, without constituting discrimination as referenced above.\n[13] Turning to jurisprudence, in Ali v. R., 2008 CarswellNat 1629, 2008 FCA 190, para 13, the Federal Court of Appeal observed re the role of subsection 15(1) of the Charter in the context of benefits per subsection 118.2(2) of the Act:\n13. The appellants wish to have the scope of the METC extended to cover \u201coff the shelf\u201d drugs but Parliament has not chosen to do so. In this regard, the words of Chief Justice McLachlin in paragraph 41 of Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 657 (S.C.C.), are apposite:\n41. It is not open to Parliament or a legislature to enact a law whose policy objectives and provisions single out a disadvantaged group for inferior treatment; Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203. On the other hand, a legislative choice not to accord a particular benefit absent demonstration of discriminatory purpose, policy or effect does not offend this principle and does not give rise to a s. 15(1) review. This Court has repeatedly held that the legislature is under no obligation to create a particular benefit. It is free to target the social programs it wishes to fund as a matter of public policy, provided the benefit itself is not conferred in a discriminatory manner: Granovsky v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 703, 2000 SCC 28, at para. 61; Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 325, 2002 SCC 83, at para. 55; Hodge, supra, at para. 16.\n[14] Here, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that:\ni. Parliament, \u201cis under no obligation to create a particular benefit\u201d; and\nii. Parliament, \u201cis free to target the social programs it wishes to fund as a matter of public policy, provided the benefit itself is not conferred in a discriminatory manner\u201d.\n[15] I will dismiss the appeal, albeit without costs; judgment to issue accordingly.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 6th day of January 2023.\n\u201cB.

Tax Benefit\n(a) A series of transactions was undertaken to circumvent the application of paragraph (b) of the definition of CCPC in subsection 125(7) of the Income Tax Act (the Act) in order for the appellant to qualify as a CCPC\n(b) As a result, the appellant was able to access the enhanced investment tax credit (ITC) rate in subsection 127(10.1) of the Act and to benefit from the application of subsection 127.1(1) of the Act.\n(c) Consequently, in computing its ITC for the taxation years under appeal, the appellant was to claim an additional amount equal to 15% or 20% of its \u201cSR&ED qualified expenditure pool\u201d as defined in subsection 127(9) of the Act.\n(d) The tax benefit consists of the reduction of tax resulting from the additional refundable ITC claimed by the appellant in each taxation year under appeal as detailed below:\nAdditional refundable ITC claimed\n2011\n$292,331\n2012\n$293,339\n2013\n$293,775\n2014\n$249,749\n2015\n$202,418\nThe rate was 15% for taxation years ending before 2014.\nc) the Respondent underlines that the transactions described in subparagraphs 7.1(e) i. to viii. of the Amended Reply are identical to the assumptions of facts mentioned in paragraph 7 of the original Reply to the Notice of Appeal. Therefore, the Appellant is aware of the relevant evidence the Respondent relies on to support the application of the GAAR.\nSubparagraphs 7.1(e) i to viii, read as follows:\nII. Avoidance Transactions\n(e) The following transactions constitute a series of transactions (Series of Transactions) that resulted in the tax benefit identified above:\ni. The incorporation of 0698817 B.C. Ltd on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\nii. The incorporation of 0698824 B.C. Ltd. on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\niii. The incorporation of 0698829 B.C. Ltd on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\niv. The incorporation of the appellant, PolarSat Technology Inc., on July 2, 2004.\nv. The settlement of the Trust by 0698817 B.C. Ltd on January 1st, 2005.\nvi. The transfer of PSat1\u2019s assets to the appellant on January 1st, 2005.\nvii. The transfer by PSat1 of 100 common shares it held in the appellant to 0698817 B.C. Ltd on January 1st, 2005.\nviii. The donation by 0698817 B.C. Ltd of 100 common shares it held in the appellant to the Trust on January 1st, 2005.\nd) the Respondent further adds, in paragraph 7.1(f), that none of the transactions may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.\nParagraph 7.1(f) reads as follows:\n(f) None of the transactions in the Series of Transactions may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.\ne) the Respondent adds at paragraph 9, the references to subsection 152(9), section 245 and subsection 248(10) of the Income Tax Act to the list of provisions on which the AGC relies on. The amended paragraph 9 reads as follows:\n9. The AGC relies on section 127.1, 245 and subsections 125(7), 127(5), 127(9), 127(10.1), 152(9), 248(1), 248(10), 256(5.1), 256(6.1) and 256(6.2) of the Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp), as amended. The AGC also relies on article 321 of the Quebec Civil Code, SQ, 1991, c 64.\nf) finally, relying on the well-established framework to apply the GAAR, the Respondent explains her alternative argument in paragraphs 14 to 25 of the Amended Reply.\nParagraphs 14 to 25 read as follows:\nThe GAAR\n14. At this stage, in the alternative, the AGC respectfully submits that the GAAR applies to deny the tax benefit noted above.\n15. The framework to apply the GAAR is well established. Three conditions must be met for its application:\n(a) There must be a tax benefit resulting from a transaction or a series of transactions;\n(b) The transactions or, in the case of a series of transactions, at least one of the transactions in the series, must be an avoidance transaction (not undertaken primarily for bona fide non-tax purposes);\n(c) The avoidance transactions must be abusive, meaning that they circumvent, frustrate or defeat the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions giving rise to the tax benefit.\nI. Tax benefit\n16. The AGC submits that the transactions described in subparagraphs 7.1(d)i to viii, constitute a series of transactions, within the common law meaning of that term and its extended meaning in subsection 248(10) of the Act.\n17. The AGC submits that the Series of Transactions resulted in a tax benefit for the appellant within the meaning found at subsections 245(1) and 245(2) of the Act, namely to access the enhanced ITC rate in subsection 127(10.1) of the Act and to benefit from the reduction of tax resulting from the additional ITC claimed under subsection 127.1(1) of the Act.\nII. Avoidance Transactions\n18. The AGC submits that none of the following avoidance transactions may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit, and are consequently avoidance transactions within the meaning of subsections 245(2) and 245(3) of the Act.\n(a) The incorporation of 0698817 B.C. Ltd on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\n(b) The incorporation of 0698824 B.C. ltd on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\n(c) The incorporation of 0698829 B.C. Ltd on June 30, 2004 and the appointment of Mr. Cos Modafferi as President and Chief Executive Officer.\n(d) The incorporation of the appellant, PolarSat Technology Inc., on July 2, 2004.\n(e) The settlement of the Trust by 0698817 B.C. Ltd on January 1st, 2005.\n(f) The transfer of PSat1\u2019s assets to the appellant on January 1st, 2005.\n(g) The transfer by PSat1 of 100 common shares it held in the appellant to 0698817 B.C. Ltd. on January 1st, 2005.\n(h) The donation by 0698817 B.C. of 100 common shares it held in the appellant to the Trust on January 1st, 2005.\nIII. The Series of Transactions resulted in an abuse of paragraph (b) of the definition of CCPC in subsection 125(7) as well as subsections 127(10.1) and 127.1(1) of the Act\n19. The ACG submits that the avoidance transactions are abusive within the meaning of subsection 245(4) of the Act since:\n(a) they circumvented the application of paragraph (b) of the definition of CCPC in subsection 125(7) of the Act in order to unduly benefit from the enhanced ITC regime in subsections 127(10.1) and 127.1(1) of the Act, and\n(b) the result frustrates the underlying rationale of these provisions.\n20. Prior to entering into a Series of Transactions, 99.9% of PSat1\u2019s were owned by non-resident corporations. As a result, PSat1 did not qualify as a CCPC by virtue of paragraph (b) of the definition of the term in subsection 125(7) of the Act, and consequently was not entitled to the enhanced ITC regime.\n21. By implementing its reorganization, and in particular by transferring PSat1\u2019s assets to the appellant and by interposing a trust between the appellant and the non-resident shareholders, the appellant was able to circumvent the application of paragraph (b) of the definition of CCPC in subsection 125(7) of the Act and qualify as a CCPC. It was therefore eligible to claim the fully refundable ITCs at the enhanced rate.\n22. The enhanced ITC regime was introduced to benefit Canadian small business owners. It was therefore limited to CCPC\u2019s, which the Act treats as a proxy for its ultimate shareholders. In other words, where a corporation does not qualify as a CCPC, it is because its shareholders are not intended to benefit from certain incentives reserved for resident individuals, including the enhanced ITC regime.\n23. In this case, the Trust was inserted to break the legal ownership link between the appellant and its ultimate non-resident owners. However, the Trust is merely a conduit. In effect, through a series of wholly-owned holding corporations, the non-residents are the capital and income beneficiaries of the Trust. There was therefore no change in effective ownership of the appellant. Moreover, the non-residents are indirectly entitled to any income distributed by the appellant to the Trust, which, according to the trust deed, must be paid out within the year. Accordingly, all of the benefits of the enhanced ITC continue to accrue to them, albeit indirectly. The result clearly frustrates the rational of the enhanced ITC regime.\n24. Moreover, the AGC submits that the result also frustrates the underlying rationale of paragraph (b) of the definition of CCPC. This provision attributes all shares owned by non-residents to a hypothetical person. In enacting paragraph (b), Parliament made it clear that control by non-residents is not the only determining factor in establishing CCPC status. Simple ownership, direct or indirect, of a majority of shares by non-qualifying persons is sufficient to disqualify a corporation from being a CCPC. The AGC adds that the reason why paragraph (b) is inoperative in this case is because the ownership link between the operating corporation and its non-resident shareholders was broken as a result of the insertion of a Trust. However, the non-resident shareholders remain the effective owners of those shares.\nIV. Reasonable Tax Consequences\n25. The tax benefit noted above should be denied pursuant to subsection 245(2) of the Act. The reasonable tax consequences would be to disallow the additional refundable ITC\u2019s claimed under subsections 127(10.1) and 127.1(1) of the Act for the taxation years at issue.\nPart II- Facts\nA. Question at issue in this appeal\n[3] On April 25 and July 15, 2016, the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) issued reassessments to the Appellant for its 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years, to deny the enhanced investment tax credit it had claimed for those years pursuant to subsection 127(10.1) of the Income Tax Act R.S.C 1985, C.1 (5th Supp.), as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d) on the basis that the Appellant did not qualify as a \u201cCanadian Controlled Private Corporation (\u201cCCPC\u201d).\n[4] In the paragraph 7 of the Reply, the Respondent has stated the facts relied upon by the Minister in concluding that the Appellant was controlled de facto by Polarsat Holdings Inc. (\u201cPSat1\u201d) which, in turn, was held by many non-resident corporations.\n[5] In paragraphs 10 to 13 of the Reply, the Respondent has stated the grounds relied upon in determining that the Appellant did not qualify as a CCPC as defined in subsection 125(7) of the Act. The grounds can be summarized as follows:\na) All the shares of PSat1 owned by the non-residents would be notionally attributed to a hypothetical shareholder, which would control de jure PSat1 by virtue of paragraph b) of the definition of CCPC found in subsection 125(7) of the Act.\nb) The non-resident hypothetical shareholder who controls PSat1, and PSat1 itself, control simultaneously, directly or indirectly in any manner, the Appellant pursuant to subsection 256(5.1) of the Act. In effect, PSat1 is in a position to have significant influence over the Appellant, both from an economic and operational perspectives.\nc) Subsection 256(6.1) of the Act specifies, for greater certainty, that a corporation may be controlled simultaneously by persons or groups at more than one level above it in a corporate chain. Moreover, subsection 256(6.2) of the Act states that the rule regarding simultaneous control in subsection 256(6.1) of the Act also applies to the concept of de facto control set out in subsection 256(5.1) of the Act. Their primary effect is to cause each corporation in a chain of controlled corporations to control each corporation below it simultaneously.\nd) As a result, when applying paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of CCPC found in subsection 125(7) of the Act together with subsections 256(5.1), 256(6.1) and 256(6.2) of the Act, the Appellant is controlled directly or indirectly in any manner simultaneously by PSat1 and the notional non-resident shareholder and consequently cannot be a CCPC and thus is not eligible to receive the 35% refundable investment tax credit under subsection 127(10.1) of the Act.\nB. Procedural Context\n[6] On February 12, 2019, the parties filed a timetable for the completion of the preliminary steps prior to hearing.\n[7] On March 14, 2019, the Honourable Justice K. Lyons issued an Order from the Court confirming the deadlines established in the timetable filed by the parties.\n[8] On September 12, 2019, by letter filed to the Court, the parties requested to suspend the timetable until a decision was rendered in the appeal of CO2 Solution Technologies Inc. (\u201cCO2\u201d), file number 2015-5635(IT)G, which was heard on November 20, 2018, before the Honourable Justice Smith.\n[9] The parties commonly agreed that the decision in CO2 would provide helpful guidance in the conduct of the examinations for discovery in the present file because of the similarities in the issues with CO2.\n[10] By letter dated September 24, 2019, the Court allowed the matter to be held in abeyance until a decision in CO2 had been rendered and ordered the parties to report, within 60 days following the decision to be rendered in CO2, on the status of the appeal in the present case.\n[11] On December 20, 2019, the Honourable Justice Guy R. Smith rendered a judgment in the CO2 file.\n[12] However, on January 20, 2020, CO2 appealed Justice Smith\u2019s judgment to the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n[13] Consequently, on January 27, 2020, the parties mutually decided to submit to the Court a request to maintain the suspension of the matter until a final decision would be rendered in the CO2 appeal.\n[14] The parties proposed to undertake to communicate with the Court within 70 days of the FCA\u2019s decision to be rendered.\n[15] By letter dated March 4, 2020, the Court allowed the matter to continue to be held in abeyance pending the resolution at the FCA of the CO2 file.\n[16] The letter by the Court ordered the parties to report, within 70 days following the decision to be rendered in the CO2 appeal, on the status of the appeal of the present file.\n[17] On April 27, 2020, Bresse Syndics Inc (\u201cBresse Syndics\u201d) filed a Notice of Continuance of Suit in the CO2 file, as they were appointed at act as Trustee of CO2\u2019s assets and were authorized by the FCA to act as the appellant in the continuance of suit on their behalf.\n[18] The CO2 file was then cited as Bresse Syndics Inc v. Canada, 2021 FCA 115 and the Honourable Chief Justice No\u00ebl, concurred by Justices Nadon and Rivoalen, rendered a judgment on June 10, 2021.\n[19] By letter signed by the parties and filed to the Court on August 17, 2021 and pursuant to the letter dated March 4, 2020, the parties reported to the Court on the status of the file and established a new timetable.\n[20] November 8, 2021, the Honourable Justice Bocock issued an Order confirming the deadlines established by the new timetable filed by the parties on August 17, 2021.\n[21] The examination for discovery of the Respondent\u2019s nominee, Ms. Patrizia Molino, and the Appellant\u2019s nominee, Mr. Cosimo Modafferi, were held prior to the deadline established by the new timeline, on January 21, 2022.\n[22] Ms. Molino had undertaken to answer four questions during the course of her examination for discovery. By April 30, 2022, three major undertakings were completed and sent to the Appellant. As for the fourth undertaking, after a reminder received from Appellant\u2019s counsel, the Respondent\u2019s counsel provided answers on May 20, 2022.\n[23] On May 6, 2022, Respondent\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the Appellant\u2019s counsel to advise him that the Respondent would raise an alternative argument based on the general anti-avoidance rule to support the Reassessments issued to Polarsat Inc. In this letter, Respondent\u2019s counsel added that draft Amended Reply to the Notice of Appeal will be sent by the end of June.\n[24] On May 30, 2022, Respondent\u2019s counsel sent an email to Appellant\u2019s counsel for their consent to file an Amended Reply to the Notice of Appeal (\u201cAmended Reply\u201d), pursuant to section 54 of the Rules.\nPart III- Submissions of the Parties\nA. Respondent\n[25] Section 54 of the Rules provides that a party may amend its pleadings under certain conditions:\n54. A pleading may be amended by the party filing it, at any time before the close of pleadings, and thereafter either on filing the consent of all other parties, or with leave of the Court, and the Court in granting leave may impose such terms as are just.\n[26] Under section 54 of the Rules, the Court has a broad discretion to allow an amendment, but must interpret the Rules liberally, \u201cto secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits\u201d. (Continental Bank Leasing v R., 93 D.T.C. 298, paras 18 and 19). In R.v. Canderel Ltd. [1993] 2 C.T.C. 213, para 10 (\u201cCanderel\u201d), a unanimous decision of the FCA, Justice D\u00e9cary wrote that the \u201cgeneral rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. Provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.\u201d\n[27] More recently, the FCA clarified the guiding principles for amendments in Canada v. Pomeroy Acquireco Ltd. 2021 FCA 187 (\u201cPomeroy\u201d). It stated that Courts should allow amendments at any stage if they assist in \u201cdetermining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d. This is subject to the condition that the amendments do not result in an injustice not compensable by costs and that it serves the interests of justice to allow them (at para. 4).\n[28] Subsection 152(9) of the Act allows the Minister to advance an alternative basis or argument in support of an assessment at any time after the normal reassessment period subject to certain limitations, such as situations where the taxpayer may no longer have access to relevant evidence.\n[29] In this instance, the amendments proposed by the Respondent are meant to enable the Crown to raise an additional argument in support of its position and are based on the existing facts found in the Reply. Therefore, the facts at the heart of this litigation remain the same, whether it is for the primary position of the Respondent or the proposed alternative argument.\n[30] The Respondent alleges that the amendments will not cause an injustice to the Appellant that cannot be compensated by an award of costs and states that the Appellant will not be prejudiced by not having access to relevant evidence.\n[31] The proposed amendments are based on the same facts as the ones found in the Reply. Therefore, the Appellant is not taken by surprise nor is it in a situation where it is obligated to present evidence with respect to facts or transactions that were not known until now.\n[32] In the Reply at subparagraph 7(k), the Respondent has already put at issue the purpose of the reorganization of 2005. Therefore, the Appellant was already aware that the objectives sought by the reorganization were relevant considerations for the purpose of this appeal.\n[33] For the GAAR analysis, the question of whether the transactions forming part of the series of transactions constitute avoidance transactions requires an objective assessment of the driving forces of the transactions (whether it is tax-driven or whether it has a bona fide non-tax purpose). The inquiry will focus on an objective test to determine the primary purpose of the transactions in light of the relevant facts and circumstances and not on statements of intention.\n[34] The appellant\u2019s nominee, Mr. Cosimo Modafferi, has been examined by the Respondent and has been able to provide context to the transactions forming part of the reorganization of 2005 as well as the objectives sought.\n[35] Mr. Cosimo Modafferi has been involved with the Polarsat Group since at least 2003. He has been a director and officer of various corporate entities within the group that were instrumental to the reorganization that took place as of 2004 and continued in 2005. Furthermore, Mr. Cosimo Modafferi held the position of Trustee of Polarsat Financial Trust and director of PSat1. During his examination for discovery, Mr. Modafferi provide context regarding planning documents and other relevant corporate documents.\n[36] In any event, the Respondent will bear the burden of convincing the Court that the transactions of the series are avoidance transactions and that the series of transactions resulted in a tax benefit.\n[37] The Respondent also alleges that the timing of the amendments does not create an injustice for the Appellant as the Respondent proposed to amend its pleading after the completion of the examinations for discovery after a re\u2011evaluation of its position. The Respondent acknowledges that the potential application of the GAAR had been considered by various officers of the CRA during the audit of the Appellant but that it was ultimately not a basis on which the reassessments had been issued.\n[38] The fact that the Respondent has chosen to add now the proposed amendments to its pleading does not constitute a prejudice to the Appellant. If the Appellant wishes to conduct further discovery on the amendments, the Respondent will support the costs of it. As the matter has not been set down for hearing yet, it cannot be said that the instruction of this matter would be substantially delayed because of the amendments.\n[39] The Respondent considers that it is in the interest of justice to grant leave to amend. Considering the absence of procedural unfairness or abuse of process, it would be in the interests of justice to allow the amendments required by the Respondent.\n[40] The reliance on the GAAR in this case is particularly relevant because the Appellant argues, as an alternative position that even if the Appellant was controlled de facto by PSat1 (or PSat Holdings), the Appellant would still qualify as a CPCC since PSat1 (or PSat Holdings) would not be a non resident corporation or a public corporation.\nB. Appellant\n[41] The Respondent alleges that the Respondent did not establish the reassessments under appeal relying on GAAR, as a primary or alternative basis. The reassessments were solely and exclusively established based on a technical position combining specific deeming provisions and de facto control provisions in the Act.\n[42] In the course of the audit, which lasted two and a half years, CRA employees, including the auditor and two tax avoidance specialists from the CRA Headquarters, concluded that GARR was not a suitable basis for reassessment in this case.\n[43] In June 2022, when all the pre-trial stages had been conducted by the parties and a few days prior to the Parties delay to communicate with the Court to set a time and place for hearing, the Respondent filed and served a motion for leave to amend its Reply to include GAAR as an alternative basis for reassessment. According to the Appellant, this Court has never allowed the Respondent to invoke GAAR as an alternative argument so late in the pre-trial process.\n[44] The Respondent alleges that the Respondent\u2019s motion must be quashed for the following four (4) reasons:\na) GAAR has never been the real issue at question between the parties (in fact, its application was ruled out be the Respondent more than six (6) years ago);\nb) The unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence presented by the Appellant demonstrates that it will suffer an important prejudice that cannot be compensated with costs, namely, the inability to provide evidence at trial if the amendment is allowed;\nc) The Respondent\u2019s motion and the supporting affidavit are deficient, and fall short of the burden of proof necessary for the Respondent to obtain leave to amend; and\nd) It is contrary to the interest of justice to allow the amendment.\n[45] The real question at issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is a CCPC within the meaning of subsection 125(7) of the Act, and is thus entitled to the 35% refundable investment tax credit pursuant to subsection 127(10.1) of the Act? The CCPC status is a technical concept precisely defined in the Act. A corporation qualifying as a CCPC has access to a member of tax benefits and tax disadvantages. Over the last nine (9) years, the Parties always conducted this dispute on the mutual understanding that the sole issue was whether the Appellant qualified as a CCPC under subsection 125(7) of the Act.\n[46] The Respondent had numerous opportunities to introduce on alternative basis of the reassessments but failed to do so.\n[47] The appellant alleges that the burden of proving the facts justifying the amendment falls on the Respondent (Merck & Co. Inc. v Apotex Inc., 2003 FCA 488, para. 32). The Respondent\u2019s application record fails to meet the burden for the following reasons:\na) the affidavit in support of the Respondent\u2019s motion does not state any facts justifying:\n- how the amendment allegedly helps determine the real question(s) in controversy;\n- how it does not result in an injustice to the Appellant that is not capable of being compensated by any award of costs, and\n- how it serves the interest of justice;\nb) the affidavit in support of the Respondent\u2019s motion was filed by a paralegal in the Tax Law Services of the Department of Justice who has no personal knowledge of the facts that would potentially be relevant to justify the leave to amend. The Respondent\u2019s affidavit is, on its face, useless to support the motion brought by the Respondent;\nc) the Appellant filed an affidavit of its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cosimo Modafferi, in support of its opposition to the motion. The affidavit explains in detail why the Appellant would suffer a prejudice that is not capable of being compensated by an award of cost, and why it is against the interest of justice to allow the amendment. As the Respondent choose not to cross-examine Mr. Modafferi on its affidavit, it follows that the evidence adduced by the Appellant against the motion is unchallenged and uncontradicted, and must be taken as is.\n[48] The Appellant considers that invoking GAAR this late in the process, once all the pre-trial steps have been duly completed, represents a radical change in the nature of the question of controversy which has significant consequences:\na) the Appellant will inevitably suffer an irreparable prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs, because the Appellant will be significantly limited in its ability to adduce evidence on the existence of bona fide transactions, since most of the evidence that relate to these events does not exist anymore; and\nb) the interest of justice will not be served, since allowing the amendment here would defeat the purpose of pleadings, because the Respondent provided no explanation for why the amendment is necessary and why it happened just before fixing the date for the trial.\n[49] If the Respondent is allowed to amend its Reply to include GAAR, the Appellant will have to adduce evidence about the purpose and context of the transactions that occurred in between 2003 and 2005, when the alleged series of transactions took place, to establish that the transactions had bona fide purposes. The affidavit of Mr. Modafferi is clear to the effect that:\na) the three (3) individuals and majority shareholders whom authorized the corporate reorganization that occurred between 2003 to 2005 (which the Respondent claims is a series of avoidance transactions for the purpose of GAAR) were not shareholders of the Appellant during the taxation years at issue, and are not shareholders of the Appellant anymore;\nb) Mr. Modafferi hasn\u2019t had any exchanges with these three (3) individuals for many years, and has no way of contacting them;\nc) the three shareholders were at all time non-residents of Canada;\nd) it is those three shareholders that decided the structure of the Appellant to which the Respondent seeks to apply GAAR to.\n[50] Because the alleged series of transactions occurred 20 years ago and that the shareholders who took the decisions at that time and who could shed light on the purpose of the transactions are long gone, the ability of the Appellant to adduce evidence on the purpose of these transactions will be considerably limited. The Appellant will be blocked in presenting a proper defense against one of the three (3) criteria that need to be met for GAAR to apply.\n[51] The inability of the Appellant to bring forward key witnesses and to submit relevant documents that would have supported its claim will negatively impact its chances of success in that hypothetical appeal.\n[52] In the Appellant\u2019s view, pre-trial steps such as pleadings, list of documents and examinations for discovery are meant to crystalize the issues. They must be given a sense and a purpose. Parties must be held accountable for the choices they make in litigating or not issues. Taxpayers are entitled to certainty and Parties should not be allowed to revert the issues and arguments they knowingly and freely chose to forgo, but for exceptional circumstances. No such exceptional circumstances exist about the Respondent\u2019s case.\nPart IV. Analysis and Conclusion\n[53] The case law on this matter is clear, the decision whether to allow an amendment to a pleading is discretionary and the controlling principle is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action if it assists in determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided it would not result in an injustice not compensable in costs and that it would serve the interests of justice (Pomeroy).\n[54] In my view, the proposal amendments in respect of the GAAR argument will assist the Court in determining the real questions in controversy between the parties and will not result in an injustice to the Appellant or fail to serve the interests of justice.\n[55] The proposed amendments in respect of the GAAR argument are permissible in this case because they are consequential on the facts already alleged in the pleadings, including the Notice of Appeal and the assumptions in the Reply.\n[56] The proposed amendments would not result in prejudice, non-compensable in costs, to the Appellant. The prejudice alleged by the Appellant arose from the fact that the three (3) majority shareholders whom authorized the corporate reorganization between 2003 and 2005 were at all times non-residents of Canada and were not shareholders of the Appellant in the taxation years under appeal.\n[57] In this particular case, I am not convinced that the fact of not having a potential access to the shareholders who approved the reorganization constitutes a real problem because Mr. Cosimo Modafferi, as Chief Executive Officer of the Appellant since February of 2003, will be able to adduce evidence on the object and purpose of the transactions forming part of the reorganization. In his professional functions as Chief Executive Officer of the Appellant, and as President and Chief Executive Officer of 0698817 BC Ltd, 0698829 BC Ltd and of 0698824 BC Ltd and as trustee of PolarSat Financial Trust, Mr. Modafferi had a direct and personal knowledge of all the transactions that took place in the course of the reorganization and he had access to all the corporate and financial records of the parties involved in the reorganization, including corporate planning strategies, tax opinions and implementation documents. Mr. Modafferi played an active and a crucial role in the corporate reorganization.\n[58] The determination if a transaction forming part of a series of transactions was undertaken for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit must be determined by reference to all the facts and surrounding circumstances and not by the stated intention of the parties who approved it (OSFC Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 FCA 260 at para. 46).\n[59] The change of mind of the Minister concerning the use of the GAAR argument is certainly very disappointing for the Appellant but it does not come as a surprise. Taxpayers entering into aggressive tax planning, as the one in this case, are normally made aware of the possibility that the plan may be attacked by the Minister by the application of the GAAR rules. The tax opinions concerning the proposed transactions usually refer to that possibility. In this case, the possible use of GAAR has been raised at the audit level and has been raised in Court in Solutions MindReady R&D Inc. v. the Queen, 2015 TCC 17, para. 39 in respect of a tax structure similar to the one used by the Appellant.\n[60] The affidavit filed in support of the Respondent\u2019s motion is satisfactory in its present form because no new facts requiring personal knowledge by the deponent and not already mentioned in the pleadings have been advanced in the notice of motion. Furthermore, the Attorney General of Canada is not required to justify why the decision has been made to refer to the GAAR argument, an alternative argument. In my view, the Attorney General of Canada should not be precluded from adding an alternative argument in a reply because some officers of the CRA, no matter how important they are, have decided not to do so in the pre-trial steps.\n[61] For all these reasons, the motion is allowed without costs and the Court grants leave for the Respondent to file the Amended Reply to the Notice of Appeal.\nSigned at Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, this 25th day of January 2023.\n\u201cR\u00e9al Favreau\u201d\nFavreau J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 10\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-2771(IT)IG\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nPOLARSAT INC.

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 100\nDate: 20230717\nDocket: 2017-3940(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nMICHAEL GREER,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The main issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant, Mr. Michael Greer, was required to include a shareholder benefit in computing income for 2005 after receiving real properties worth over $2.4 million from a corporation owned by his late father\u2019s estate. The fair market value of those properties is at issue as well.\n[2] If the Appellant was required to include a shareholder benefit, the next issue is whether the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) was entitled to reassess the benefit after the normal reassessment period. If the Appellant made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect or carelessness in filing his 2005 return, the Minister was entitled to reassess. On that issue, the onus was on the Crown.\n[3] I have concluded the Appellant was required to include a shareholder benefit in computing his 2005 income. The Minister was entitled to reassess the benefit even after the normal reassessment period because, in failing to report that benefit, the Appellant made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect or carelessness. I have also concluded that the fair market value of the properties was $2,436,900 rather than $2,846,200 as assumed by the Minister.\nI. Introduction [4] The Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year to include an additional $2,846,200 in computing his income under a combination of subsections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Act. In particular, the Minister included:\n(a)a shareholder benefit of $1,584,200 under subsection 15(1) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) and\n(b)a shareholder loan of $1,262,000 under subsection 15(2) of the Act.\n[5] Here are the relevant portions of subsections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Act:\n15(1) Where at any time in a taxation year a benefit is conferred on a shareholder \u2026 by a corporation \u2026 the amount or value thereof shall \u2026 be included in computing the income of the shareholder for the year.\n15(2) Where a person \u2026 is\n(a) a shareholder of a particular corporation, \u2026\nand the person \u2026 has in a taxation year received a loan from or has become indebted to the particular corporation, \u2026 the amount of the loan or indebtedness is included in computing the income for the year of the person or partnership.\n[6] The Minister\u2019s assessment of a shareholder benefit of $1,584,200 under subsection 15(1) reflected the difference between the price the Minister assumed the Appellant paid for four real properties in and around Fredericton, New Brunswick, transferred to him in 2005 by H. Greer & Son Ltd. (\u201cHGSL\u201d) ($1,262,000) and their fair market value at the time of the transfer ($2,846,200).\n[7] The Minister\u2019s reassessment of a shareholder loan of $1,262,000 under subsection 15(2) reflected a loan the Minister assumed was made by HGSL to the Appellant to allow him to purchase those properties from HGSL.\nA. Position of Each Party\n[8] The Appellant\u2019s position was that he had not been a shareholder of HGSL since 1973 or 1974. The Appellant also argued that he made no misrepresentation in filing his 2005 return and even if he had, the misrepresentation was not attributable to neglect or carelessness. The Appellant also argued that having vacated an earlier reassessment for his 2006 taxation year, the Minister was precluded from re-litigating the same issues with respect to his 2005 taxation year. Finally, the Appellant argued that even if he was a shareholder, and even if the Minister was right about the fair market value of the properties, the reassessment should be vacated because the Minister took too long to reassess.\n[9] The Crown\u2019s position was that the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL as of July 10, 1996, as indicated in the shareholders\u2019 register, and that the fair market value of the properties he purchased from HGSL in 2005 was not less than $2,846,200. The Crown also argued that by filing his 2005 return without reporting the shareholder benefit of $1,584,200 and the shareholder loan of $1,262,000, the Appellant made misrepresentations attributable to neglect or carelessness.\nB. Summary of Conclusions\n[10] I have concluded that the fair market value of the four properties immediately after the transfer was $2,436,900 rather than $2,846,200 as assumed by the Minister in reassessing.[1] I have also concluded that the only applicable provision of the Act is subsection 15(1). In particular, I have concluded that:\n(a)the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL in 2005;\n(b)HGSL transferred the properties to the Appellant in 2005 for no consideration;\n(c)the fair market value of the properties at that time was $2,436,900;\n(d)because HGSL conferred a benefit on the Appellant as shareholder in the amount of $2,436,900 in 2005, the Appellant was required to include a shareholder benefit of that amount in computing income for his 2005 taxation year under subsection 15(1) of the Act;\n(e)the Appellant made a misrepresentation in filing his 2005 tax return by failing to report any shareholder benefit; and\n(f)the misrepresentation was attributable to neglect or carelessness.\n[11] The appeal will, therefore, be allowed and the reassessment sent back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the Appellant was required to include a shareholder benefit of $2,436,900 in computing income for his 2005 taxation year under subsection 15(1) of the Act.\nII. The Vacated Reassessment (2006 Taxation Year) [12] In 2012, the Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year on the same basis as the Minister later reassessed his 2005 taxation year. The Minister initially reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year because she had incorrectly assumed that HGSL transferred the properties to the Appellant in 2006. The Appellant objected to the 2006 reassessment.[2]\n[13] During the audit of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year, the Appellant showed the minute book of HGSL to the auditor. In particular, the auditor testified that in 2009 or 2010, he visited the Appellant\u2019s office and was provided with the minute book which he scanned and printed. That was the source of the shareholders\u2019 register of HGSL marked as Exhibit R-15 and attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to these reasons.[3]\n[14] The Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year on the basis that:\n(a) HGSL transferred four properties to the Appellant in 2006; and\n(b) the fair market value of those properties at that time was not less than $2,846,200.\n[15] Under the 2006 reassessment, which was made beyond the normal reassessment period, the Minister included in computing the Appellant\u2019s 2006 income a shareholder benefit of $1,584,200 under subsection 15(1) of the Act and a shareholder loan of $1,262,000 under subsection 15(2) of the Act.\n[16] Once it became clear that the property transfers occurred in 2005 rather than 2006, the Appeals Division of the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) vacated the 2006 reassessment.\n[17] No appeal was instituted in this Court, and no pleadings were filed, in respect of the 2006 reassessment. As it was vacated by the Appeals Division of the CRA following the Appellant\u2019s objection, there was never any appeal of that reassessment to this Court.\nIII. The Reassessment at Issue (2005 Taxation Year) [18] Some time after the 2006 reassessment was vacated, the CRA auditor responsible for issuing the 2006 reassessment reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year. The only meaningful change to the Minister\u2019s assumptions was that the properties were transferred by HGSL to the Appellant in 2005 rather than 2006. The Minister reassessed the same shareholder benefit and the same shareholder loan but, this time, did so in respect of the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year. That is the reassessment under appeal.\nIV. The Trial [19] The parties filed a partial agreed statement of facts. The Appellant then testified. The Appellant then called an accountant with whom he began working in 2017. It soon became obvious that the accountant had no personal knowledge of any of the events at issue and, therefore, had no relevant evidence to give. Appellant\u2019s counsel then asked the Court to receive his evidence as an expert. I declined counsel\u2019s invitation as resolution of the issues pleaded required no expert accounting evidence.\n[20] Each party called an expert real estate appraiser with respect to the fair market value of the four properties immediately after their transfer to the Appellant by HGSL.\n[21] Finally, the Crown called the CRA auditor, Mr. Ken Stewart, to give evidence on the earlier reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year and the documents provided to the CRA by the Appellant in the course of that audit, including HGSL\u2019s minute book.\nV. Findings of Fact, Legal Analysis, and Application of the Law to the Facts [22] The Appellant is a resident of New Brunswick. His father was Hedley Greer and his stepmother was Violetta Greer. HGSL was in the business of property development and sales. It was controlled by the Appellant\u2019s late father, Hedley Greer and had been incorporated in New Brunswick.\n[23] Hedley Greer passed away in 1998. After his death, his control block of shares in HGSL was transferred to his estate (the \u201cEstate\u201d). Hedley Greer\u2019s will provided that:\n(a)Violetta Greer would be the executrix and trustee of the Estate;\n(b)all net income of the Estate would be paid to Violetta Greer during her lifetime; and\n(c)on the death of Violetta Greer, the Estate would be divided in half with one-half paid in equal shares to the Appellant and his two sisters and the other half paid in equal shares to the nieces and nephews of Violetta Greer.\n[24] In 2000, the Appellant acquired the interests of his sisters in the Estate for $474,000 with funds that he borrowed from HGSL, but never repaid. Following that transaction, he had a beneficial interest in one-half of the Estate.\n[25] Violetta Greer owned 100 shares of HGSL personally. She was also a director and officer of HGSL.\n[26] The Appellant was sole shareholder of three corporations:\n(a)H. Greer & Son (2006) Ltd.;\n(b)Five Star Equipment Sales Ltd.; and\n(c)Greer\u2019s Mountain Salvage Ltd.\n[27] In 2006, the Appellant incorporated the first company, H. Greer & Son (2006) Ltd., to carry on the business of buying and selling properties.[4]\n[28] On October 4, 2005, when Violetta Greer was 86 years old, HGSL transferred four properties to the Appellant for no consideration:\n(a)Mini mall \u2013 Timothy Avenue;\n(b)Woodland end of Michael and Violetta Avenue;\n(c)619 acres end of Timothy Avenue; and\n(d)End of Timothy Avenue.\n[29] At a meeting of the directors of HGSL approving the transfer of the properties to the Appellant, Violetta Greer acted as chair and the Appellant acted as secretary. The deed for each of the four properties, dated October 4, 2005, discloses that HGSL was the \u201cgrantor\u201d and the Appellant the \u201cgrantee\u201d.[5]\n[30] In 2006 and 2007, the Appellant sold some of the properties to third parties and transferred most of the remaining properties to his own company, H. Greer & Son (2006) Ltd.\nA. Issue #1 \u2013 Did the Appellant Receive a Loan from HGSL?\n[31] Contrary to the assumption made by the Minister in reassessing, I find that the Appellant did not pay for any of the four properties that HGSL transferred to him in 2005. It, therefore, follows that he received no loan from HGSL within the meaning of subsection 15(2) of the Act.\n[32] Although he was well aware that it was HGSL, rather than the Estate, that transferred the properties to him, the Appellant rationalized the transfer as a distribution from the Estate:\nQ. Now, in October 2005, you had acquired some properties from the company.\nA. Yes.\nQ. And these were four properties that you acquired from the company in 2005.\nA. Yes. Those were my inheritance.\nQ. \u2026 you purchased these properties from the company in - on October 4, 2005.\nA. I purchased it, you said?\nQ. Okay....\nA. I received it. It was an inheritance.[6]\n***\nQ. Did you ever repay the loan back to the company?\nA. Which loan, sir?\nQ. The loan of $1.381 million, the combined of the - the three numbers we just went through.\nA. No, that was given to be as an inheritance.\nQ. Well, you never repaid - you never repaid....\nA. I never had to repay this because it was an inheritance. The money I would\u2019ve had to repay was the $274,000 or $474,000 - whatever it was, and I didn\u2019t have to because she [Violetta] said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nQ. Okay so you didn\u2019t repay the $474,000 and you didn\u2019t pay the $1.381 million....\nA. I didn\u2019t have to repay this; this was my inheritance. My share of the company. I didn\u2019t have to buy my share of the company because it was my inheritance.[7]\nB. Issue #2 \u2013 Was the Appellant a Shareholder of HGSL? [33] This is the central issue in this appeal. At trial, the Appellant denied having been a shareholder of HGSL when HGSL transferred the properties to him in 2005. In support of that position, his counsel noted that the Appellant received neither a share certificate nor dividends from HGSL. She also relied on a letter not in evidence that was written by counsel four years before the transactions at issue. The letter asserted, in passing, that Violetta Greer was the sole shareholder of HGSL.[8]\n[34] In concluding that the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL when it transferred the properties to him, I have relied on three factors: (1) the unreliability of the Appellant\u2019s evidence; (2) the shareholders\u2019 register of HGSL; and (3) the presumption in subsection 181(3) of the New Brunswick Business Corporations Act (\u201cNBBCA\u201d).\n(1) The Unreliability of the Appellant\u2019s Evidence [35] On the issue of whether the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL at the time of the transfers, I have concluded that the Appellant\u2019s evidence is unreliable.[9]\n[36] The Appellant began by denying any involvement with HGSL:\nQ. You were also involved in H. Greer and Sons Limited.\nA. Am I involved in H....\nQ. You were also involved in that company as well.\nA. No, I wasn\u2019t. I just helped my stepmother in that company. I had no involvement in it at all.[10]\n[37] The Appellant doubled down on his testimony by telling the Court that, as near as he knows, \u201cI wasn\u2019t part of it.\u201d[11]\n[38] But later in cross-examination, the Appellant made a series of admissions demonstrating, contrary to his earlier denials, that he was deeply involved in the corporate affairs of HGSL:\nMR. OMISADE: Q. You were the president of the company?\nA. Yes, I was the president of the company.\nQ. You were also at one point the vice-president of the company?\nA. All right, I was the vice-president of the company.\nQ. You were a director of the company?\nA. And I was a director of the company.\nQ. You acted at the shareholder\u2019s meeting on behalf of the company?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you carried out transactions on behalf of the company as well.\nA. Yes.[12]\n[39] In light of these admissions, the Appellant\u2019s earlier testimony regarding his lack of involvement in HGSL had been discredited. Indeed, the Appellant acted as secretary of HGSL at the corporate meeting authorizing the transfer of the properties from HGSL to himself. In addition to holding office as secretary, he held office as president of HGSL and was a director as well.[13] Finally, he signed documents as president of HGSL effecting the transfer of each property from HGSL to himself.\n[40] In his evidence in chief, the Appellant was asked about the share of HGSL that the Minister assumed he owned in 2005:\nQ. And when did you hold a share in HGSL?\nA. Apparently, I got one in 1970.\nQ. Do you know how many shares you had?\nA. Apparently, I was told I had one.\nQ. Who told you, you had one?\nA. My father.\nQ. When?\nA. 1970.\nQ. What other discussions did you have with your father about the share?\nA. That was it. Never talked about it again. And then we got in a spat, and he took it away and gave it to Pete [Mockler]. That\u2019s the last I heard of it.\nQ. When did that happen? Do you recall?\nA. Oh, probably \u201973, close to \u201974.[14]\n[41] In reassessing, the Minister assumed that the Appellant owned one common share of HGSL.[15] The evidence offered by the Appellant to rebut this assumption falls far short of the mark and does nothing to diminish, let alone demolish, the central assumption of fact made by the Minister in reassessing \u2212 that the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL when the properties were transferred to him.[16]\n[42] Then there is the Appellant\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d theory. In his Notice of Appeal, the Appellant alleged that from 1970 to 1974 he \u201cheld one share [of HGSL] in trust for his father.\u201d[17] During examination-in-chief, the Appellant was asked by counsel about his understanding of holding a share \u201cin trust\u201d. The Appellant responded that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any idea what a share is, like, really.\u201d[18]\n[43] The Appellant\u2019s response to this question \u2212 that he has no idea what a share is \u2212 further diminishes his reliability on the issue of whether he was a shareholder of HGSL at the relevant time. The Appellant was sole shareholder of three companies.[19] He knew or ought to have known what a share was, particularly as he had legal advice on the incorporation of at least one of those companies:\nQ. And when was HGSL 2006 incorporated?\nA. 2006.\nQ. Right, and why did you incorporate?\nA. Well, I thought that would be good thing to do, but looking back it probably wasn\u2019t.\nQ. Why did you think it would be a good idea?\nA. Well, I thought that\u2019s how you run companies. Seriously.\nQ. And did anybody give you advice?\nA. Lawyers and accountants.[20]\n[44] Returning to the Appellant\u2019s \u201ctrust\u201d theory, his counsel submitted that the Appellant\u2019s holding of one share of HGSL \u201cwas subject to a trust in favour of Hedley\u201d.[21] There was no evidence of any such trust. Asserting a theory that has no basis in fact or law further diminishes the Appellant\u2019s reliability on the question of whether he was a shareholder of HGSL at the relevant time.\n[45] Finally, the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he had not owned a share in HGSL after 1973 or 1974 was further discredited by his prior inconsistent statement. In the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Objection against the 2006 reassessment, he admitted that he was a shareholder of HGSL prior to June 13, 1998. This is inconsistent with his testimony that his father took away his share of HGSL in 1973 or 1974 and that was the last he heard of it. In cross-examination, Crown counsel refreshed the Appellant\u2019s memory about what he stated in his Notice of Objection to the 2006 reassessment:\nMR. OMISADE: Q. \u2026 Mr. Greer, if I could please just ask you to turn to Tab 47 of the Book of Documents. When you were initially assessed for 2006, you had served a Notice of Objection on the Minister from 2006, when you were initially assessed.\nA. Yes.\nQ. If I could just turn your - you had (inaudible) for representing you, do you remember that? (Inaudible), it\u2019s a law firm.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember them representing you with the CRA?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And if I could ask you to look at Tab 47, it\u2019s entitled, \u201cNotice of Objection to Reassessment for Michael Greer.\u201d\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you see that?\nA. Yeah.\nQ. Do you recall looking at that or discussing that with your lawyers?\nA. I\u2019m sure we did, yes.\nQ. Okay. If I could just turn your attention to page 210, the next page.\nA. Yes.\nQ. On the facts, paragraph 3 there, it says that, \u201cPrior to June 13, 1998, H. Greer and Sons was controlled by Hedley Greer with the following issued and outstanding shares: 899 for Hedley Greer, 100 shares for Violetta Greer, and one share for Michael Greer.\u201d\nA. I see that, yes.\nQ. And did you agree with that?\nA. Well, it\u2019s there. I still don\u2019t remember having a share, sir, but whatever you say.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: But the question is do you agree with that statement that....\nA. Well, I agree with it, yes. Yes, I do.[22]\n[46] As the Appellant\u2019s evidence on this point was discredited by the Crown, I turn to HGSL\u2019s shareholders\u2019 register.\n(2) The Shareholders\u2019 Register of HGSL [47] An evidentiary issue arose in respect of HGSL\u2019s shareholders\u2019 register. It was most certainly relevant but it was subject to an exclusionary rule, namely, the rule against hearsay.\n[48] Hearsay evidence is generally considered to have three components: (1) a statement made outside of court by a declarant; (2) which a party seeks to adduce in court for the truth of its content; (3) without the ability of the other party to contemporaneously cross\u2011examine the declarant.[23]\n[49] Among the traditional exceptions to the rule against hearsay is a \u201cparty admission\u201d. The party admission exception includes any \u201cacts or words of a party offered as evidence against that party\u201d.[24]\n[50] During the audit of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year, the Appellant produced the minute book of HGSL to the auditor. The auditor visited the Appellant\u2019s office and reviewed the minute book which he scanned and printed for his file. That minute book was the source of the shareholders\u2019 register of HGSL attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to these reasons.\n[51] The Appellant\u2019s act of providing the auditor with the shareholders\u2019 register of HGSL constitutes a party admission. Having provided that document to the auditor, the Appellant cannot be heard to complain about its unreliability.[25]\n[52] Having established the admissibility of the shareholders\u2019 register, I draw several inferences from it. First, the Appellant is listed as holding one share of HGSL as of July 10, 1996. In light of his involvement in the corporate affairs of HGSL, the Appellant knew or ought to have known about that entry in the shareholders\u2019 register. Had he believed he was not a shareholder of HGSL as of that date, he could have applied to rectify the register under section 168 of the NBBCA as noted below.\n[53] Second, the Estate is listed on the shareholders\u2019 register as owning 899 shares of HGSL as of August 20, 1998. If the Appellant did not own a single share of HGSL as at that date, why would the Estate have owned 899 rather than 900 shares of HGSL? Who owned the missing single share? I draw the inference that it was the Appellant. The Appellant\u2019s ownership of a single share of HGSL is the best explanation for the Estate\u2019s ownership of 899 rather than 900 shares of HGSL.\n(3) The Presumption in Subsection 181(3) of the NBBCA [54] By way of background, subsection 18(1) of the NBBCA requires every corporation to prepare and maintain a share register:\n18(1) A corporation shall prepare and maintain, at its registered office or at any other place in New Brunswick designated by the directors, records containing\n(a) \u2026;\n(b) \u2026;\n(c) \u2026;\n(d) a share register complying with section 48; and\n(e) \u2026.\n[55] Subsection 48(1) of the NBBCA sets out the elements of a corporate share register:\n48(1) ... a corporation shall maintain a share register in which it records the shares or fractions thereof issued by it showing with respect to each class or series of shares\n(a) the names, alphabetically arranged, and the latest known address of each person who is or has been a shareholder;\n(b) the number of shares held by each shareholder; and\n(c) the date and particulars of the issue and transfer of each share.\n[56] Subsection 20(2) of the NBBCA requires every corporation to take reasonable precautions to facilitate the detection and correction of inaccuracies in its share register:\n20(2) A corporation and its agents shall take reasonable precautions to\n(a) prevent loss or destruction of,\n(b) prevent falsification of entries in, and\n(c) facilitate detection and correction of inaccuracies in,\nthe registers and other records required by this Act to be prepared and maintained.\n[57] Most importantly, subsection 181(3) of the NBBCA includes a presumption that an entry in a share register is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the holder shown in the register is the owner of the share:\n181(3) An entry in a share register of, or a share certificate issued by, a corporation is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the registered holder is owner of the share described in the register or in the certificate.\n[58] Finally, subsection 168(1) of the NBBCA provides for an application to rectify the register if the name of a person has been wrongly entered, or retained, in the share register:\n168(1) If the name of a person is alleged to be or to have been wrongly entered or retained in, or wrongly deleted or omitted from, the registers or other records of a corporation, the corporation, a shareholder of the corporation or any aggrieved person may apply to the Court for an order that the registers or records be rectified.\n[59] Had the Appellant believed that he was not a shareholder of HGSL as of July 10, 1996, he could have applied to rectify the register under subsection 168(1) of the NBBCA.\n[60] I agree with Crown counsel that the statutory presumption in subsection 181(3) of the NBBCA has not been displaced by evidence to the contrary.\n[61] For all of these reasons, I have concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was a shareholder of HGSL in 2005.\nC. Issue #3 \u2013 The Fair Market Value of the Properties [62] The Minister reassessed a shareholder benefit under subsection 15(1) on the basis that the properties had a fair market value of $2,846,000 immediately after the Appellant acquired them from HGSL. This is how the Crown\u2019s valuation chart looked at the commencement of trial:[26]\nProperty\nFair Market Value\nMini mall - Timothy Ave\n$1,000,000\nWoodland end of Michael and Violetta Ave\n$219,800\n619 acres end of Timothy Ave\n$771,000\nEnd of Timothy Ave\n$855,400\nTotal\n$2,846,200\n[63] On the second day of trial, the parties agreed on the valuation of the first two properties. They agreed that the fair market value of the mini mall on Timothy Avenue was $944,000 and that the fair market value of the woodland end of Michael Avenue and Violetta Avenue was $131,000.[27] In light of that agreement, this is how the Crown\u2019s valuation chart looked on the second day of trial:\nProperty\nFair Market Value\nMini mall - Timothy Ave\n$944,000\nWoodland end of Michael and Violetta Ave\n$131,000\n619 acres end of Timothy Ave\n$771,000\nEnd of Timothy Ave\n$855,400\nTotal\n$2,701,400\n[64] I had to determine the fair market value of the last two properties. Each party brought a real estate appraiser to assist me by providing me with a report on the fair market value of those two properties as at January 1, 2006.\n[65] The Appellant called Mr. Gerald McCombs. I accepted him as a qualified real estate appraiser. He wrote his appraisal report in 2010 and retired in 2017. He came out of retirement to testify about a report he had written some 12 years earlier. Mr. McCombs used the direct comparison approach to the valuation of the two properties. Using that method, he arrived at a fair market value of $325,500 for the third property and $489,000 for the fourth.\n[66] I have several concerns about the reliability of Mr. McCombs\u2019 report. For example, with respect to the third property, Mr. McCombs testified that the \u201cportion of the land that is classified as wetland is not as valuable as the land that can be developed.\u201d[28] But how he computed the percentage of wetland was unclear as his report did not include any of the material on which he relied for that computation:\nA. Thirty-nine percent of that 575 acres is wetland.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Thirty-nine percent?\nA. Yes, about 225 acres, I think it is.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Okay, that's in your report?\nA. Yes.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Where would I find that?\nA. I'm just....\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Your counsel can get that to me later on, you don't have to search for it in your report right now.\nA. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: So don't worry. But Ms. Brown, just, if you could get back to me on the location within the report of that 39 percent figure?\nA. That might be just my calculation and not necessarily written down in the report.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Okay, but on what basis did you arrive at that calculation?\nA. Looking at the maps and calculating it from the maps.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Are the maps in the report?\nA. Unfortunately, these reports are only what I have. Anything that was in the file is no longer available. It dated back to 2010 and they scanned everything in but they didn't scan in - sorry, they didn\u2019t scan in everything.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Who's they?\nA. \u2026 my former employer. My office.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: So you're just remembering off the top of your head, 39 percent?\nA. I calculated it again by looking at a map online.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Oh, okay. So the basis of that 39 percent calculation is not in your report, then?\nA. I don't believe it is.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Okay, thank you.[29]\n[67] Mr. McCombs opined that 28 acres of the third property could be developed in the short term and 16 acres could be developed later. Once again, the basis for this opinion was unclear.[30] There was another significant omission from the report tendered by Mr. McCombs. It related to an adjustment he made to subsequent comparable sales based on the passage of time:\nJUSTICE SPIRO: And how do you compute the time adjustment?\nA. Well, if you - if you - if the difference in value is $25 per acre and the time frame is, say, five years, then it's a percentage of the dollar amount to determine what the time adjustment is.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: Is that explained in your report somewhere?\nA. No, it is not.[31]\n[68] That oversight affected the opinion that Mr. McCombs offered in respect of the fourth property:\nJUSTICE SPIRO: All right, I just have one question on this report. Mr. McCoombs, so if we go to the same table, the Market Analysis chart, I see that Index 5, which sold in July of 2008 is not subject to any time adjustment at all, yet Index 6, which sold only one month later is subject to effectively a 15 percent time adjusted discount. There's only one month difference between the two sales, why did you determine that August merited a 15 percent discount, whereas July merited absolutely no discount?\nA. Basically, I - I probably should have.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: What should have?\nA. Index 5 should have been adjusted downwards.\nJUSTICE SPIRO: By about how much?\nA. By the 15 percent, if you're looking at July to August.[32]\n[69] The Crown called Mr. Marcel Cormier. I accepted him as a qualified real estate appraiser. His status as an employee of the CRA elicited no objection from Appellant\u2019s counsel. After considering his answers to my questions, I was entirely satisfied that his opinion evidence would be unbiased, impartial, and independent. He concluded that the fair market value of the third property was $524,000 and the fair market value of the fourth was $837,900.\n[70] During his testimony, I was impressed by the detailed explanations in his report, particularly comparable sales, and his thorough and thoughtful answers to my questions. He did extensive research, made use of aerial imagery and mapping (which were very helpful in following his evidence), and took into account factors that Mr. McCombs had not considered such as the 2004 announcement of the Trans-Canada Highway interchange and the general growth trend in the development of the Hanwell area after 2004.[33] He used an additional valuation method for a portion of one of the properties, namely, the subdivision development method which had not been used by Mr. McCombs. He also considered events that Mr. McCombs had not considered (e.g., land expropriations). He weighted comparable sales in a way that Mr. McCombs did not.[34] Finally, he quantified and explained certain costs that would have been incurred by an owner before selling certain portions of the property.[35] That is also something Mr. McCombs did not do.\n[71] For all of those reasons, I prefer the opinion of Mr. Cormier to that of Mr. McCombs and conclude that the fair market value of the third property as at January 1, 2016 was $524,000 and the fair market value of the fourth property was $837,900 as at the same date. This is the final version of the valuation chart:\nProperty\nFair Market Value\nMini mall - Timothy Ave\n$944,000\nWoodland end of Michael and Violetta Ave\n$131,000\n619 acres end of Timothy Ave\n$524,000\nEnd of Timothy Ave\n$837,900\nTotal\n$2,436,900\nD. Issue #4 \u2013 Did the Appellant make a Misrepresentation Attributable to Neglect or Carelessness in Filing his 2005 Return? [72] There is no dispute that the Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period. In light of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act, the Crown must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed fraud in filing his 2005 tax return:\n152(4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[73] Determining whether the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period is a two step process. First, the Crown must prove that the Appellant made a misrepresentation in filing his 2005 return by failing to report a shareholder benefit on acquiring, for no consideration, four properties from HGSL worth more than $2.4 million. Second, the Crown must prove that the misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or that the Appellant committed fraud in filing his return. The Crown has made no allegation of wilful default or fraud.\n[74] What exactly did the Appellant know when he reviewed and signed his 2005 return? He knew that he did not acquire the properties from the Estate because he knew that the Estate did not own the properties.[36] He knew that he did not acquire the properties from his stepmother as he knew that his stepmother did not own the properties. He knew that HGSL owned the properties and that they were transferred to him for no consideration. Finally, as discussed earlier, he knew or ought to have known that he was a shareholder of HGSL as of July 10, 1996, as reflected in the shareholders\u2019 register.\n[75] Failing to report a shareholder benefit in such circumstances is clearly a misrepresentation. The next question is whether the misrepresentation is attributable to neglect or carelessness.\n[76] In Canada v Paletta, 2022 FCA 86, the Federal Court of Appeal made it clear that \u201cneglect\u201d refers to a lack of reasonable care. The Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes \u201creasonable care\u201d informs the second step of the analysis:\n[65] Neglect under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) refers to a lack of reasonable care. The duty of reasonable care is met if the taxpayer has \u201cthoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assesse[d] the situation and file[d] on what [he] believe[d] bona fide to be the proper method\u201d; in other words, \u201cin a manner that the taxpayer truly believe[d] to be correct\u201d (Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd. v. Canada, [1990] 2 C.T.C. 183, 90 D.T.C. 6427 (F.C.T.D.); aff\u2019d in Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd. v. Canada (1991), 126 N.R. 141, 91 D.T.C. 5101 (F.C.A.); see also Canada v. Johnson, 2012 FCA 253, 435 N.R. 361). This test is not disputed by the parties. The Court may also draw inferences of negligence from an omission to verify the validity of a taxpayer\u2019s belief (Robertson v. Canada, 2016 FCA 303, 2016 D.T.C. 5131, paras. 5 and 6).[37]\n[77] The business of one of the Appellant\u2019s corporations was buying and selling properties.[38] The Appellant helped sell properties owned by HGSL[39] and was responsible for making the deals.[40] He owned three of his own companies and had legal advice on the formation of at least one of them. He was clearly an experienced real estate person and shareholder.\n[78] In cross-examination, the Appellant confirmed that, when filing his 2005 tax return, he did not review his status as a shareholder of HGSL with his accountant nor did he consult any other professional about the tax implications of the properties he acquired from HGSL.[41]\n[79] The Appellant knew or ought to have known that acquiring more than $2.4 million of corporate property from HGSL for no consideration was a shareholder benefit. His failure to consult a tax professional before filing his 2005 return reflects a lack of reasonable care and was, therefore, negligent. The Appellant did not thoughtfully, deliberately, and carefully assess the situation before filing his return.\n[80] This Court\u2019s decision in Cl\u00e9roux v The Queen, 2013 TCC 365, is instructive in this regard. In that case, the taxpayer was the sole shareholder and director of a corporation that owned a subsidiary (6154301 Canada Inc.). The corporation transferred the shares of the subsidiary, worth almost $278,000, to the taxpayer for $100. Justice Favreau had little difficulty applying subsection 15(1) of the Act to the transaction. He found that the corporation conferred a benefit on its shareholder by transferring the shares of its subsidiary to him for inadequate consideration. The only question was whether the Crown had demonstrated neglect by the taxpayer. Here is his answer:\n[19] In the present appeal, I agree with counsel for the respondent that the appellant showed negligence by not reporting the value of the benefit he obtained on the acquisition of the shares in 6154301 Canada Inc. Considering his real estate experience and his knowledge of all the transactions involving the building on Daniel-Johnson Street, the appellant knew or ought to have known that it is not possible to appropriate a company\u2019s property for consideration less than its fair market value.[42]\n[emphasis added]\n[81] Here too, the Crown has met the onus of proof with respect to both steps of the analysis. The Minister was fully justified in reassessing the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year in respect of the subsection 15(1) shareholder benefit beyond the normal reassessment period.\nE. The Appellant\u2019s Other Legal Arguments [82] Counsel for the Appellant argued that the reassessment is barred by the doctrines of res judicata, issue estoppel, or abuse of process as the Court should not allow the Minister to relitigate issues finally resolved when the Minister vacated the 2006 reassessment. But all the authorities cited by counsel in support of her res judicata, issue estoppel, and abuse of process arguments involved relitigating issues determined by a court or concluded by way of a settlement agreement between parties to litigation. In the absence of any litigation in this Court in respect of the 2006 reassessment, the Appellant has no factual basis for her res judicata, issue estoppel, or abuse of process arguments.\n[83] Counsel also contended that the reassessment should be vacated because the Minister\u2019s delay in reassessing caused adverse and prejudicial impacts to the Appellant. This is her argument:\nA substantial amount of time has gone by from 2005 when the Appellant filed the return . . . to today. The elapse of time generally has put the Appellant in an unfairly vulnerable position. Time has damaged his ability to obtain information and witnesses regarding the assets and their valuation. Key witnesses have died, such as Violeta [sic] Greer herself . . ., the accountant Shawny Merrill, and E.J. Mockler, Q.C. HGSL has been dissolved, in or about the year 2015. The charter of HGSL has been surrendered. The HGSL minute book has not been located. These problems arising since 2005 have created prejudice for the Appellant. The prejudice caused by this length of time justifies vacating the Reassessment.[43]\n[84] In short, counsel argued that the elapse of time \u201chas permanently hurt the Appellant\u2019s ability to bring together all the facts in his case.\u201d[44] A complete answer is found in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act which sets out the circumstances in which the Minister may reassess beyond the normal reassessment period. If Parliament wanted the Minister to meet any additional requirements, it would have said so.\n[85] As Justice Rothstein, then of the Federal Court of Appeal, pointed out in Chaya v Canada, 2004 FCA 327:\n[4] The applicant says that the law is unfair and he asks the Court to make an exception for him. However the Court does not have that power. The Court must take the statute as it finds it. It is not open to the Court to make exceptions to statutory provisions on the grounds of fairness or equity. If the applicant considers the law unfair, his remedy is with Parliament, not with the Court.[45]\n[86] Finally, counsel relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Law Society of Saskatchewan v Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29. Based on that decision, she contended that the length of time the CRA took to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2005 taxation year constitutes an \u201cabuse of process\u201d with the result that the 2005 reassessment must be vacated. In her pre-trial submission, she put it this way:\nJust as abuse of process applied to administrative proceedings of the Law Society in Abrametz, abuse of process similarly applies to the tax proceedings in the present case.[46]\n[87] The only \u201cproceedings\u201d to which abuse of process could possibly apply are the proceedings before this Court. As the Appellant has made no allegation of delay against the Crown with respect to these proceedings, this argument has no merit.\nVI. Costs\n[88] The Crown has prevailed on the shareholder benefit and statute-barred issues. However, as the Minister reassessed almost 45% of the total amount under the wrong provision of the Act \u2013 subsection 15(2) \u2013 and as the Minister assigned too high a value to the properties, causing her to incorrectly add $400,000 to the Appellant\u2019s income, success was divided. For that reason, each party should bear their own costs.\nVII. Conclusion [89] HGSL conferred a benefit on the Appellant as shareholder in the amount of $2,436,900 in 2005. The Appellant was required to include that amount as a shareholder benefit in computing income for his 2005 taxation year under subsection 15(1) of the Act. The Appellant made a misrepresentation in filing his return for that year by failing to report any shareholder benefit. That misrepresentation was attributable to neglect or carelessness. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed so that the reassessment may be sent back to the Minister to reassess the appropriate amount of shareholder benefit under the appropriate provision of the Act.\n[90] The reassessment will be sent back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment, without costs, on the basis that the Appellant was required to include a shareholder benefit of $2,436,900 in computing income for his 2005 taxation year under subsection 15(1) of the Act.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 17th day of July 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

Background and Facts: [1] This matter came before the Court by way of a Notice of Assessment dated September 10, 2019, issued to the Appellant by the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) wherein the Respondent denied the Appellant\u2019s application for a GST\/HST New Housing Rebate. The Appellant filed a Notice of Objection on September 19, 2019 and ultimately a Notice of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada on August 16, 2021. The Respondent filed a Reply on July 15, 2022, thereby enjoining the issues which are before the Court.\n[2] The issue before the Court relates to the Appellant\u2019s residence at 108 Dunrobin Lane, Grimsby, Ontario. The Appellant asserts that he intended to reside in this residence. The Appellant signed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale for the residence on July 8, 2016 for $413,847.00. The Appellant had planned to marry and raise a family in what he described as a great family area, quiet with good space in and around the residence, which was to have three bedrooms.\n[3] The Appellant had a partner for approximately 2.5 years, but they separated and went their own ways in January 2017.\n[4] The Appellant had returned to Canada from Kentucky, United States where he worked as a general manager of gas stations (his father\u2019s business) for a period of five years. The Appellant returned to Canada when his father\u2019s gas stations were sold, and lived with his parents upon returning to Canada.\n[5] The Appellant planned to go into operating a trucking business which was to be owned and developed by his parents. Initially, it would involve one truck in which he was the driver and also general manager for the business, hauling freight in and about Ontario. In terms of background, he attended two years at York University in political science but did not complete his degree. He lived with his parents and worked in the business from the home of his parents.\n[6] He had worked for a trucking company for about four months in 2015, at which time he obtained his trucking licence. This licence allowed him to drive trucking vehicles. As noted, in 2016 his parents were establishing their own trucking business.\n[7] In 2016, the Appellant\u2019s income of $60,000.00 was entirely from his employment in the trucking business of his parents. In 2017, his income dropped to $38,000.00, again entirely from employment in the trucking business of his parents. In 2018, his income dropped to zero dollars although he continued to work in the trucking business of his parents.\n[8] Initially in 2016, the Appellant used a mortgage broker to seek out financing for the purchase of the residence in question. He could afford a mortgage for about $420,000.00 at that time given the rates that he used in his calculations. He was advised by the broker that he was preapproved for financing in the area of $420,000.00 based upon his annual income in 2016 of $60,000.00.\n[9] The Appellant closed the Agreement of Purchase and Sale in March 2018. By the closing date, the Appellant had several issues of concern:\na)The Appellant had broken up with his partner in January 2017. Therefore there was only a single income within which to finance the monthly mortgage payments which would become due upon the closure of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale in March 2018.\nb)The trucking business of his parents (HS Steelers Transport) that was his employer was not doing well, and as a result, his income of $60,000.00 in 2016 was dropped by the company to $38,000.00 in 2017 and eventually to zero in 2018. He continued to drive a truck for the business in question and was its general manager while operating the business out of his parents\u2019 house where he was living.\nc)The Appellant could not obtain conventional mortgage financing due to his limited income when it came to close the residence transaction in question in March 2018.\nd)The Appellant resorted to a private mortgage with high interest rates and administration fees. The financing on a private mortgage was extremely expensive and this was even after the Appellant\u2019s parents provided a mortgage on their own house, plus a mortgage on the residence in question. The Appellant describes this as \u201cit is what it is\u201d.\ne)The parents\u2019 trucking business eventually turned around but it was too late for the Appellant to obtain financing for the residence and during this period of time, the Appellant had to seek financing help from his parents.\n[10] The Appellant\u2019s partner was never a party to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale for the property. There was no agreement with his partner to participate in the mortgage payments after the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was signed.\n[11] In terms of occupancy of the residence in question post-property closing, the premises was heated by natural gas. The Appellant did not prepare or consume any meals in the residence, only staying at the residence for approximately two nights per week. The only furniture or housekeeping items he had on the premises was a mattress, sheets and pillows and a table. The Appellant had occupational home insurance for the residence, as well as internet and natural gas for the stove and for heat. He eventually sold the residence for $455,000.00.\nII. ISSUES: [12] There are three issues before the Court:\n1)Whether the Appellant acquired the property with the intent to use it as a primary place of residence as per paragraph 254(2)(b) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-15 (\u201cETA\u201d).\n2)Whether the occupancy of the residence by the Appellant as required under paragraph 254(2)(g) of the ETA was such that he had to occupy the property as his primary place of residence or just occupy it as his place of residence.\n3)Was the Appellant frustrated from carrying out his intention to occupy the premises as his place of residence and if so, did the frustration exist or even apply such as there was an exempt supply under subparagraph 254(2)(g)(ii)?\nIII. The law: [13] Section 254(2) of the ETA states as follows:\nNew housing rebate\n(2) Where\n(a) a builder of a single unit residential complex or a residential condominium unit makes a taxable supply by way of sale of the complex or unit to a particular individual,\n(b) at the time the particular individual becomes liable or assumes liability under an agreement of purchase and sale of the complex or unit entered into between the builder and the particular individual, the particular individual is acquiring the complex or unit for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual,\n(c) the total (in this subsection referred to as the \u201ctotal consideration\u201d) of all amounts, each of which is the consideration payable for the supply to the particular individual of the complex or unit or for any other taxable supply to the particular individual of an interest in the complex or unit, is less than $450,000,\n(d) the particular individual has paid all of the tax under Division II payable in respect of the supply of the complex or unit and in respect of any other supply to the individual of an interest in the complex or unit (the total of which tax under subsection 165(1) is referred to in this subsection as the \u201ctotal tax paid by the particular individual\u201d),\n(e) ownership of the complex or unit is transferred to the particular individual after the construction or substantial renovation thereof is substantially completed,\n(f) after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed and before possession of the complex or unit is given to the particular individual under the agreement of purchase and sale of the complex or unit\n(i) in the case of a single unit residential complex, the complex was not occupied by any individual as a place of residence or lodging, and\n(ii) in the case of a residential condominium unit, the unit was not occupied by an individual as a place of residence or lodging unless, throughout the time the complex or unit was so occupied, it was occupied as a place of residence by an individual, or a relation of an individual, who was at the time of that occupancy a purchaser of the unit under an agreement of purchase and sale of the unit, and\n(g) either\n(i) the first individual to occupy the complex or unit as a place of residence at any time after substantial completion of the construction or renovation is\n(A) in the case of a single unit residential complex, the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual, and\n(B) in the case of a residential condominium unit, an individual, or a relation of an individual, who was at that time a purchaser of the unit under an agreement of purchase and sale of the unit, or\n(ii) the particular individual makes an exempt supply by way of sale of the complex or unit and ownership thereof is transferred to the recipient of the supply before the complex or unit is occupied by any individual as a place of residence or lodging,\nthe Minister shall, subject to subsection (3), pay a rebate to the particular individual equal to\n(h) where the total consideration is not more than $350,000, an amount equal to the lesser of $6,300 and 36% of the total tax paid by the particular individual, and\n(i) where the total consideration is more than $350,000 but less than $450,000, the amount determined by the formula\nA \u00d7 [($450,000 - B)\/$100,000]\nwhere\nA is the lesser of $6,300 and 36% of the total tax paid by the particular individual, and\nB is the total consideration.\n[14] There are a number of case authorities which were cited by either the Respondent or the Appellant during the course of closing arguments and those authorities are: Gagn\u00e9 v The Queen, 2007 TCC 175, a decision of Justice Favreau; Sozio v The Queen, 2018 TCC 258, a decision of Justice Bocock; Fard v The Queen, 2022 TCC 42, a decision of Deputy Judge Masse; Gill v The Queen, 2016 TCC 13, a decision of Justice Smith; Kniazev v The Queen, 2019 TCC 58, a decision of Justice Smith; Margolin v The Queen, 2018 TCC 36, a decision of Deputy Judge Masse; Virani v The Queen, 2010 TCC 113, a decision of Justice Campbell; Berkovich v The Queen, 2014 TCC 268, a decision of Justice Lyons; Sivakumar v The Queen, a decision of Justice Campbell and Kandiah v The Queen, 2014 TCC 276, a decision of Justice C. Miller.\n[15] There is a point that should be addressed and that is the question of occupation of the residence in question; there is a difference between paragraph 254(2)(b) and paragraph 254(2)(g). In paragraph 254(2)(b), the provision focuses on the intention of the Appellant for use \u201cas the primary place of residence\u201d of the particular individual. Paragraph 254(2)(g) makes no reference to the phrase \u201cprimary\u201d but simply refers to occupying \u201cas a place of residence\u201d. This can be a significant difference in sections in terms of application. Upon review, the authorities referred to and applying the Rules of Statutory Interpretation, I believe another interpretation must also be applied.\nIV. ANALYSIS: [16] I am satisfied with the evidence of the Appellant that the Appellant\u2019s intention at the time of the execution of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale to use the residence as his primary place of residence.\n[17] Paragraph 254(2)(b) of the ETA provides that the particular individual whose is acquiring the unit in question must have the intention to acquire the residence for the use of primary place of residence. The intention is determined at the time the Appellant entered into the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, not at the time of occupancy (Wong v The Queen, 2013 TCC 23). A taxpayer\u2019s intention is a question of fact and when determining intention a judge must look to both the taxpayer\u2019s stated intention as well as the surrounding factual circumstances (Kukreja v The Queen, 2014 TCC 56). There are a variety of factors which go into whether or not the evidence supports the intention in question. In this particular case, the Appellant had no real experience in the real estate market[1]. The Appellant did not have to make any efforts[2] to sell a former property because he had no former property. The intention was that of the taxpayer alone; he would have been a single person although he had a brief discussion with his partner at the time about the purchase. That partner did not participate in, become liable under, or become a party to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale on the property in question. The taxpayer\u2019s income at the time of entering the Agreement of Purchase and Sale according to him was sufficient for him to meet the monthly obligations on the perspective mortgage in question.\n[18] I found the Appellant to be forth-right and frank in his evidence. He was direct and did not avoid answering difficult questions. I think that he had some level of naivety with respect to his long-term prospects, but given that this is his first adventure into the real estate market, this is not surprising. I am satisfied that the Appellant had the intention at the time of the execution of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale to use the residence as his primary place of residence.\nA. Did the Appellant Occupy the Property as a Place of Residence? [19] As alluded to above, the residence test is different between paragraphs 254(2)(b) and (g); the former requires the property to be the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d, whereas the latter only requires the property to be a \u201cplace of residence\u201d.\n[20] The Respondent relies on Gill v The Queen, 2016 TCC 13 for the proposition that paragraph 254(2)(g) requires a taxpayer to occupy the property as their \u201cprimary\u201d place of residence. In Gill at paragraph 29, Justice Smith wrote regarding paragraph 254(2)(g):\nThere must be an element of permanence that supports the intention to acquire the complex for use as a primary residence. Transitory occupancy cannot satisfy the requirement that the purchaser be \"the first individual to occupy the complex\" within the meaning of paragraph 254(2)(g) of the ETA.\n[21] With respect I must disagree. In statutory interpretation, there is a presumption of consistent expression, one part of which states different words have different meanings. In Jabel Image Concepts Inc v Canada, [2000] GSTC 45, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote at paragraph 12:\nWhen an Act uses different words in relation to the same subject such a choice by Parliament must be considered intentional and indicative of a change in meaning or a different meaning.\n[22] In the case of paragraphs 254(2)(b) and (g), it must be presumed Parliament intentionally chose to make a distinction when it used the words \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d in paragraph (b) and \u201cplace of residence\u201d in paragraph (g). I must therefore reject the Respondent\u2019s argument that paragraph 254(2)(g) requires the Appellant to have occupied the property as his primary place of residence.\n[23] Notwithstanding my above commentary, I do not find the Appellant to have occupied the property. As guidance, I find the comments of Justice Bocock in Sozio v The Queen, supra, at paragraph 15 thereof to be of particular relevance:\n[15] Each case is an exercise in analyzing the taxpayer\u2019s subjective intention using the unique facts of each appeal across a variety of indicia. The facts will provide direction and inform the application and weight to be given to the indicia. In short, is what a taxpayer says or intended supported across the waypoints of occupancy. Such indicia of occupancy as a primary residence are logical:\na) demarcation of primary place of residence by change of address;\nb) the relocation of sufficient personal effects to the rebate property;\nc) if no occupancy of the residence, was there cogent evidence of frustration of occupancy;\nd) permanent occupant insurance versus seasonal or rental coverage;\ne) delivery of possession of previous primary residence to another;\nf) If dual occupancy continues, then the rebate property must be more frequently occupied, more convenient to third party locations such as work, more convenient amenities and more suitable to the needs of the taxpayer.\n[24] It is my view that occupancy is something more than simply having a mattress with a set of sheets and pillowcases and a table on the premises. Although the Appellant did some measure of staying at the premises in question, two nights per week, this certainly could not classify one as occupying the premises. What he did was arrange for the heat to be turned on at the premises, but he had to have heat at the premises because of the weather conditions. He arranged for home insurance coverage, but this would be a requirement in order to obtain any financing whether it be a conventional or private lender. He arranged for internet, but then again if he is going to spend anytime at the premises he would need internet in this day and age. What he did not do speaks more with respect to whether or not there was an occupancy of the residence by the Appellant:\na)he did not prepare or make any meals at the premises in question;\nb)he did not stay or occupy the premises for more than two nights per week;\nc)he continued to live with his parents in their place of residence;\nd)he did not change his address for mailing purposes;\ne)he did not relocate sufficient personal effects to the property in question;\nf)there was no evidence that it was more frequently occupied, in fact there was evidence to the contrary that it was less frequently occupied than his other residence that he was enjoying with his parents;\ng)there was no evidence with respect to convenience to a third party location such as work or more convenient amenities more suitable to the needs of the taxpayer.\n[25] There is no question in my mind that the Appellant had the intention to occupy the premises in question as his primary place of residence, but I do not believe that the evidence supports that he occupied the place of residence at a sufficient level to qualify for occupancy. Therefore, the Appellant does not satisfy the condition in paragraph 254(2)(g).\nB. Was There a Frustrating Event? [26] The Appellant contends he was frustrated from occupying the residence. The frustration, he argues, was his failure to obtain a conventional, long-term mortgage. To invoke frustration, the surrounding circumstances must make the frustrating event unforeseeable, beyond the buyer\u2019s control, and deny the buyer any alternative pathway to having the property be their primary residence (Sozio, supra, at para 29). If a frustrating event is found, the Appellant does not need to satisfy the occupancy requirement under subsection 254(2) (Sozio, supra, para 12).\n[27] The lack of a traditional mortgage did not prevent the Appellant from satisfying the occupancy condition under paragraph 254(2)(g). The Appellant secured a private mortgage before closing on the residence, and that mortgage allowed the Appellant to occupy the residence for at least six months. I am not convinced that having a private mortgage for the first six months, rather than a traditional mortgage, in any way prevented the Appellant from occupying the property. As a result, I cannot find the inability to secure a traditional mortgage to be a frustrating event.\nV.

Introduction\n[1] This is an appeal by Mohammad Yadgar (the Appellant) from reassessments made under subsection 15(1) of the Income Tax Act, RSC, 1985, c 1 (5th Supp) (Act). In reassessing the Appellant for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) added amounts to the Appellant\u2019s income as shareholder appropriations totalling $512,211 and imposed gross negligence penalties.\n[2] The Appellant was born in Afghanistan where he graduated from high school and studied physics in university for two years. After spending some time in Pakistan, he immigrated to Canada in 1995. Shortly after coming to Canada, and although not trained as a butcher in Afghanistan, the Appellant found work in that capacity at Paradise Fine Foods, a Toronto market specializing in halal meats. He later worked as a butcher for Sardar Shanawazi at his Mississauga supermarket called Kabul Farms, a business operated as a sole proprietorship. In 2004, Kabul Farms Inc. was incorporated (Kabul), with the Appellant and Sardar Shanawazi each owning 50% of the common shares.\n[3] Within three or four months, and although it is unclear exactly when this occurred, the Appellant purchased Sardar Shanawazi\u2019s share of the corporation. At some point in 2004 and from then on, the Appellant was the only one involved in running the business and making transactions in Kabul\u2019s business account.\n[4] During the taxation years in issue, the Appellant was also the sole shareholder of 1648074 Ontario Inc., a corporation operating a grocery store. In addition, he was a shareholder in Amana Canadian Ltd., a corporation operating a storage business.\n[5] The Minister performed a bank deposit analysis of Kabul as well as that of the Appellant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s joint bank accounts. At the objection stage, the Appellant provided revised schedules showing shareholder appropriations in the amounts of $194,579, $272,985, $23,679 and $20,968 for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years respectively.\nII. Issues\n[6] The Appellant is not challenging the correctness of the amounts, totalling $512,211, included in his income pursuant to subsection 15(1) of the Act for the taxation years in issue. He is, however, challenging the correctness of the Minister\u2019s assessment beyond the normal reassessment period as well as the correctness of the assessment of gross negligence penalties. It is not disputed that the reassessments were made after the normal reassessment period. Hence, the two issues before the Court are can be summarized as follows:\ni. was the Minister justified in reassessing the Appellant after the normal reassessment period for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years? And\nii. was the Minister justified in imposing gross negligence penalties for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years?\nIII. Information about Kabul\u2019s assessments\n[7] In his Notice of Appeal, the Appellant stated that he was relying on the facts pled in Kabul\u2019s appeal (file no 2016-3660(IT)G) given that the audit in that file had led to the Appellant\u2019s reassessments. Kabul had not filed any income tax returns for the taxation years in issue. The parties filed a Consent to Judgment in Kabul\u2019s appeal referring the matter back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that Kabul had the following unreported sales and gross profits for the taxation years ending May 31, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and that the penalties be vacated:\nYear\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\nSales\n$2,237,324\n$2,460,926\n$2,887,950\n$2,755,685\n$2,547,001\nGross Profits\n$314,192\n$306,520\n$266,355\n$400,220\n$198,343\n[8] The Court issued a Judgment dated November 23, 2016, allowing the appeal in accordance with the terms of the Consent to Judgment.\n[9] At trial, the Appellant asserted that his accountant at the time, Costa Abinajem (Costa, as he was so referred to by the Appellant at trial), advised him to open a second bank account and to make deposits of cash sales into his personal account, and that of his spouse, to avoid \u2018some\u2019 charges. Further, the Appellant acknowledged that monies from Kabul were deposited into his personal bank accounts.\nIV. Analysis\nReassessment beyond the normal reassessment period\n[10] In addressing the first issue in this appeal, the Court must determine whether the Minister was justified in reassessing the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years. For the reasons that follow, I find that the Minister has met his burden to so reassess.\n[11] Subsection 152(4) of the Act sets out the Minister\u2019s right to assess beyond the normal reassessment period determined under subsection 152(3.1). More specifically relevant to this appeal, subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) provides as follows:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n152 (4) Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie ou donner avis par \u00e9crit qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 toute personne qui a produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants :\na) le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration :\n(i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\n[12] In MF Electric Incorporated v R, 2023 TCC 60, at paras 31-33 [MF Electric], I discussed the principles which I believe should apply to the determination of whether the Minister is justified in reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period, as follows:\n[31] The wording of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) is such that it is sufficient for the Minister to establish neglect or carelessness without having to consider whether there was wilful default or fraud (see Deyab v Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at paras 58-61 [Deyab]). Having said this, the burden is on the Minister to establish both that the taxpayer or the person filing the return has made a misrepresentation and that it is attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud (see Vine v R, 2015 FCA 125 at paras 23-24).\n[32] The Minister\u2019s burden is to establish that there has been a misrepresentation at the time the return is filed. In commenting on the issue of timing in Nesbitt v Canada, 96 DTC 6588 at para 8, the Federal Court of Appeal expressed its view of the purpose of subsection 152(4) as follows:\nIt appears to me that one purpose of subsection 152(4) is to promote careful and accurate completion of income tax returns. Whether or not there is misrepresentation through neglect or carelessness in the completion of a return is determinable at the time the return is filed. A misrepresentation has occurred if there is an incorrect statement on the return form, at least one that is material to the purposes of the return and to any future reassessment. It remains a misrepresentation even if the Minister could or does, by a careful analysis of the supporting material, perceive the error on the return form. It would undermine the self-reporting nature of the tax system if taxpayers could be careless in the completion of returns while providing accurate basic data in working papers, on the chance that the Minister would not find the error but, if he did within four years, the worst consequence would be a correct reassessment at that time.\n[Underlining added]\n[33] Courts have consistently held that the threshold for establishing misrepresentation is low. In support of this view, in Francis & Associates v R, 2014 TCC 137 at para 20, Justice Bocock wrote as follows:\nA misrepresentation is any statement that is \u201cincorrect.\u201d: Minister of National Revenue v. Foot, [1964] C.T.C. 317 (Can. Ex. Ct.). Also, several cases have indicated that \u201cany\u201d error made in a return filed is tantamount to a misrepresentation, Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, [1961] C.T.C. 211 (Can. Ex. Ct.), Nesbitt v. R., and Ridge Run Developments Inc. v. R., [2007] 3 C.T.C. 2605 (T.C.C. [General Procedure]). Therefore, the threshold to establish a misrepresentation is low.\n[13] In this case, the Respondent has not alleged fraud, but rather, has alleged that the Appellant made misrepresentations that are attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\n[14] In filing his returns for the relevant taxation years, the Appellant reported the following amounts of income, which are significantly lower than the amounts of unreported income reassessed, the correctness of which he does not challenge:\nTaxation Year\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\nUnreported Income\n$194,579\n$272,985\n$23,679\n$20,968\nReported Income\n$10,600\n$10,300\n$6,300\n$10,950\n[15] Since the Appellant is not challenging the correctness of the amounts assessed as income for the relevant taxation years, the income he reported is incorrect. In my view, that is sufficient to establish that he, or the person filing his return, made misrepresentations in filing his returns or in supplying any information under the Act as provided by subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i). I note that Sajid Usmani, the Appellant\u2019s new accountant, testified at the hearing but Costa did not. Sajid Usmani explained that he retrieved the Appellant\u2019s documents and prepared schedules reflecting deposits and withdrawals in Kabul\u2019s and the Appellant\u2019s bank accounts and determined the amounts of income that had gone unreported, which are the amounts accepted by the Minister and reassessed as reflected in paragraph 13 above. However, as asserted by the Federal Court of Appeal in Nesbitt, supra at para 8, \u201c[i]t remains a misrepresentation even if the Minister could or does, by a careful analysis of the supporting material, perceive the error on the return.\u201d Thus, since the misrepresentations occurred when the returns were filed, it is irrelevant that the Appellant retained the services of a new accountant after the returns prepared by Costa were filed incorrectly.\n[16] As mentioned earlier, the Minister must establish, not only that the Appellant made misrepresentations, but also, that they are attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Appellant testified that Costa was both Kabul\u2019s accountant and his personal accountant. He stated that Costa was the accountant for the first business where he worked, Paradise Fine Foods, and that Costa had been preparing his tax returns since that time. Costa continued to prepare the Appellant\u2019s personal returns when he worked at Kabul Farms for Sardar Shanawazi, for whom Costa was also the accountant. After the incorporation of Kabul, including when he became the sole shareholder, the Appellant continued to seek the services of Costa. I note that Costa was involved in the incorporation of both Kabul, 1648074 Ontario Inc. and Amana Canadian Ltd.\n[17] The Appellant testified that he took his business records (invoices, cash register slips and mail) to Costa every two to three months. Sometimes Costa visited him such that they met every month or two, for an estimated total of 30 times over the course of the relevant taxation years. He stated that Costa filed his personal returns but that he never signed them. Further, the Appellant asserted that he did not know where the numbers for the income reported came from.\n[18] The Appellant testified that he supported a family of six during the relevant taxation years. The total income reported by the Appellant and his wife was insufficient to pay the family\u2019s living expenses, including mortgage payments on the home purchased in 2006, nor was it sufficient to provide the funds that Kabul had reported as loans received from the Appellant in the amount of more than 3 million dollars.\n[19] The Appellant may not have had a sophisticated knowledge of the tax system, but I understood from his testimony that he had been filing his income tax returns since his very first job at Paradise Fine Foods in 1995, hence he had been filing returns for a decade prior to the taxation years in issue. He was a shareholder of three corporations, a director of two. He was the sole shareholder of a very successful business, Kabul, having sales well over 2 million dollars and profits ranging from about $200,000 to $400,000 per year in its taxation years ending between 2005 and 2009. In addition, the Appellant owned property in Afghanistan, which he later sold and used the proceeds to purchase property in Ontario. He first purchased land for $290,000 and later purchased a home for $456,827, with a down payment of $27,000 and a mortgage for the balance.\n[20] The Appellant has now acknowledged that his income for the relevant taxation years was significantly underreported, and he made no inquiries at any time to confirm the appropriateness of the amounts being reported. He also acknowledged that Costa recommended he open another bank account to avoid charges. Borrowing the words of the Federal Court of Appeal in Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd v R [1991] F.C.J. No 52 (FCA) at para 7 [Regina Shoppers], I find that the Appellant did not \u201cthoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assess the situation\u201d before filing his returns; he was content to rely on the trust he claimed to have in Costa. In Regina Shoppers, the Federal Court of Appeal found that it had been established \u201cthat the care that must be exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct\u201d (see MF Electric, supra at para 36). A wise and prudent person would have reviewed his returns and would have noticed the income being reported.\n[21] At the hearing, the Appellant stated that he delegated everything to Costa, that he compiled his receipts and invoices and gave them to Costa, that he did not review his returns, and in spite of meeting with Costa about 30 times, did not ask any questions. Counsel submitted that the Appellant had reason to believe in Costa as he had met him at his first job and Costa was recommended to him and further that, although he was successful in business, he did not \u201cknow tax\u201d. Counsel relied on this Court\u2019s decision in Aridi v R, 2013 TCC 74 at paras 43 to 45, wherein Justice Hogan found that the accountant had been negligent but that the taxpayer had not. In my view, the circumstances in Aridi are entirely different from those in the present appeal. Suffice it to say that, in Aridi, the taxpayer knew there may be tax consequences to the transaction in question, provided his accountant with all the necessary documents and questioned him about his income tax return. Justice Hogan asserted that \u201c[t]o rely upon and prove neglect on the part of the accountant or professional who acted for the taxpayer will not be sufficient to prevent the application of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the ITA. The taxpayer must also have acted diligently, or at the very least, must contradict the Minister\u2019s evidence that he had acted negligently\u201d (Aridi, supra at para 50).\n[22] In this case, the Appellant took no steps to confirm the accuracy of his returns. He simply did not ask any questions. I find that the Appellant cannot shield himself from the consequences of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) by shifting the blame to Costa (see for example Snowball v R, [1996] T.C.J. No. 276 at para 18; see also Daszkiewicz v R, 2016 TCC 44). The Appellant has fallen short of exercising reasonable care (see Venne v R, [1984] FCJ No 314 (FCTD) at para 16 [Venne]).\n[23] In light of the above, I find that the Appellant made misrepresentations in filing his returns for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years and further, that these misrepresentations are attributable to neglect or carelessness. This is sufficient to support a finding that the Minister has met the burden to reassess the Appellant after the normal reassessment period for the relevant taxation years.\nPenalties under subparagraph 163(2)\n[24] In addressing the second issue in this appeal, the Court must determine whether the Minister was justified in imposing penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act with regards to the understated income in the Appellant\u2019s 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years.\n[25] Subsection 163(2) of the Act reads as follows:\n(2) Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty of the greater of $100 and 50% of the total of\u2026\n(2) Toute personne qui, sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans une d\u00e9claration, un formulaire, un certificat, un \u00e9tat ou une r\u00e9ponse (appel\u00e9 \u00ab d\u00e9claration \u00bb au pr\u00e9sent article) rempli, produit ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, selon le cas, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou y participe, y consent ou y acquiesce est passible d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e9gale, sans \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 $, \u00e0 50 % du total des montants suivants\u2026\n[26] As provided by subsection 163(3) of the Act, the Minister bears the burden of establishing the facts that justify the assessment of a penalty under subsection 163(2). Hence, the Minister must show that the Appellant made, or participated in, or assented to, or acquiesced in, the making of a false statement and did so knowingly or did so under circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[27] In this case, the Appellant acknowledged that he underreported his income and that the amounts reassessed are correct. In failing to report his income correctly, the Appellant has made a false statement such that the first element of subsection 163(2) is established. In the circumstances, the more pressing question is whether the Appellant made the false statement \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cunder circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d as required by subsection 163(2).\n[28] Since the oft-quoted case in Venne, supra, courts have consistently held that \u201cgross negligence\u201d requires greater neglect than simply failing to exercise reasonable care, which might otherwise be sufficient for the application of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) discussed earlier. In Venne, supra at para 37, the Federal Court stated that gross negligence \u201cmust involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, an indifference as to whether the law is complied with or not\u201d. This was found to mean, \u201cakin to burying one\u2019s head in the sand\u201d (see Guindon v Canada, 2015 SCC 41 at para 60).\n[29] In Wynter v Canada, 2017 FCA 195 [Wynter], the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that the Minister could meet its burden of showing that the false statement was made knowingly by demonstrating that the taxpayer was wilfully blind such that knowledge could be imputed to the taxpayer (see also MF Electric, supra). Further, in Wynter, the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that gross negligence, which is distinct from wilful blindness, \u201carises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable taxpayer. Simply put, if the wilfully blind taxpayer knew better, the grossly negligent taxpayer ought to have known better\u201d [Wynter, supra at para 18].\n[30] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Appellant made misrepresentations under circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[31] With respect, I find that Counsel for the Appellant did not clearly differentiate his position regarding the application of subsection 163(2) from that of the application of subsection 152(4). He did refer to the decision in Venne underlining the different standards that apply to these two provisions. He submitted that the Appellant came to Canada as a refuge, worked as a butcher where he could serve many clients speaking his native language of Dari while he knew very little English, and that his conduct had to be assessed through the lens of an unsophisticated taxpayer.\n[32] Counsel criticized the Respondent for not having called the auditor as a witness. In this regard, I note that in Lacroix v R, 2008 FCA 241 at para 32, the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that \u201cin the vast majority of cases, the Minister will be limited to undermining the taxpayer\u2019s credibility by either adducing evidence or cross-examining the taxpayer.\u201d When the Federal Court of Appeal later commented on its decision in Lacroix, it did so to clarify that the circumstances related to the failure to report income must be examined to establish whether the requirements of each provision have been met. The Court asserted that this ought not to be conflated with a finding that an unreported amount of income is taxable, a finding that does not inevitably lead to a conclusion that a gross negligence penalty is justified, but did not otherwise comment on the manner in which the Minister can discharge its evidentiary burden (see Deyab v Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at paras 65-66 and Khanna v Canada, 2022 FCA 84 at paras 23-24).\n[33] In determining whether the Appellant was grossly negligent, the Appellant\u2019s personal characteristics, including his education, intelligence and experience, are not relevant. In this regard, I find the remarks of Justice Owen, in Peck v R, 2018 TCC 52 at paras 50 and 51, instructive regarding the relevance of a taxpayer\u2019s personal attributes. He wrote as follows:\n[50] The subjective nature of the wilful blindness standard also means that the personal attributes of the individual may be considered in determining whether the individual is wilfully blind.\n[51] In contrast, the objective nature of the gross negligence standard means that the personal attributes of the individual are not relevant unless the individual establishes that he or she is incapable of understanding the risk the individual has failed to avoid (see R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49 at paragraph 40).\n[34] As mentioned earlier, gross negligence arises when a taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable person. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s conduct represents a marked departure from what would be expected of a reasonable person in his circumstances. Query, what can be expected of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. A reasonable person in the circumstances of the Appellant would have asked to see his income tax returns. A reasonable person would have reviewed his income tax returns and would have noticed the alarmingly low amounts of income being reported. A reasonable person would have asked questions of his accountant regarding the reported income. If concerned with the accountant\u2019s explanations, a reasonable person would have sought independent advice. A reasonable person in the Appellant\u2019s circumstances would have asked questions about the corporation\u2019s income tax returns and the monies he was moving between his personal and the corporate accounts.\n[35] In my view, the Appellant\u2019s conduct represented a marked departure from the conduct one would expect from a reasonable person placed in the same circumstances. The Appellant provided no explanation for his false statements other than to say that he relied on his accountant to prepare his returns. Like the taxpayer in Peck, supra, the Appellant cannot simply throw his hands up and say that he blindly relied on his accountant, without making any attempt at seeking a better understanding of his obligations and without making any effort to verify the accuracy of the income reported in his income tax returns.\n[36] For these reasons, I find that the Minister has established that the Appellant made false statements in his returns for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years and did so under circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\nV. Conclusion\n[37] For all of the above reasons, I conclude that the Minister was justified:\nin reassessing the Appellant after the normal reassessment period for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years; and\nii. in imposing gross negligence penalties for his failure to report income for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years.\n[38] The appeal for the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 18th day of July 2023.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 104\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-848(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMOHAMMAD YADGAR AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nToronto, Ontario\nDATE OF HEARING:\nMarch 20, 2023\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Gabrielle St-Hilaire\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nJuly 18, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nOsborne G.

OVERVIEW\n[1] This appeal is from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under section 160 of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Appellant was assessed in the amount of $138,550 for what the Minister determined was an indirect transfer of property to her from her husband, Mr. Lawrence Watts (\u201cMr. Watts\u201d).\nII. FACTS\n[2] The facts in this case are relatively straightforward and, for the most part, are not in dispute.\n[3] Three witnesses testified during the trial. They were:\n(i) Mr. Watts, the Appellant\u2019s husband;\n(ii) The Appellant;\n(iii) Mr. Robert Sarracini (Mr. Sarracini), a CRA officer.\n[4] The Appellant is Mr. Watts\u2019 wife. The two have been married since 1993.\n[5] In 2009, Mr. Watts had an outstanding tax liability of $404,452. This tax debt arose from the Minister\u2019s assessment or reassessment of Mr. Watts\u2019 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, and 2009 taxation years. This amount of tax liability was not in dispute, nor was the integrity of Mr. Watts\u2019 assessments.\n[6] The specifics of Mr. Watts\u2019 tax debts were set out in the Minister\u2019s assumptions and are as follows:\nDate of\n(Re) Assessment\nTax Year\nTotal ($)\nNovember 4, 2002\n2000\n157,171.17\nApril 7, 2003\n2001\n32,210.64\nDecember 4, 2006\n2005\n544.83\nMay 28, 2009\n2007\n31,683.06\nNovember 22, 2012\n2009\n182,842.47\nTOTAL\nblank\n404,452.17\n[7] Mr. Watts carried on the business of Fiscal Arbitrators (\u201cFA\u201d) as a sole proprietorship until it ceased to operate in 2013. In October 2015, Mr. Watts was found guilty of fraud, and in June 2016, he was sentenced to six years in prison due to the conduct of his FA business. [1]\n[8] The bank account for Mr. Watts\u2019 sole proprietorship was registered with the Bank of Montreal. The identifying digits for the FA\u2019s bank account are 785 (\u201caccount 785\u201d). FA\u2019s bank account 785 was a joint bank account between Carlton Branch (\u201cMr. Branch\u201d) and Mr. Watts.\n[9] Mr. Branch was a business partner of Mr. Watts in the FA venture. Both could draw from account 785, and each had individual cheques from the account with their names on them.\n[10] Very little evidence was provided concerning Mr. Branch\u2019s ownership of the cash contained in account 785. Specifically, of the funds in account 785, did he only own half, along with Mr. Branch, or was he a one hundred percent owner? Mr. Watts did testify that he and Mr. Branch were to split the revenues from FA.\n[11] Mr. Watts incorporated CBLW Trading Company Limited (\u201cCBLW\u201d) in February 2007 under the Canadian Business and Corporations Act (\u201cCBCA\u201d). The corporation was dissolved in December 2013. During CBLW\u2019s entire corporate existence, Mr. Watts was CBLW\u2019s only director and officer. Mr. Watts was the directing mind of CBLW at all times.\n[12] CBLW\u2019s bank account was also registered with BMO. The identifying digits of CBLW\u2019s bank account are 895 (\u201caccount 895\u201d). Mr. Branch also had signing authority for CBLW\u2019s account 895 but was never a director or officer of CBLW. In his testimony, Mr. Watts agreed that it was he who decided where the funds from this account were sent.\n[13] Mr. Watts testified that CBLW\u2019s purpose was to perform the administrative actions necessary to operate FA. These actions included paying rent for the FA\u2019s office space and managing expenses.\n[14] Mr. Watts testified that CBLW never filed documents or updated CBLW\u2019s address with the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d). Mr. Sarracini also testified that this was the case. Mr. Sarracini further testified that the address listed in the CRA\u2019s record system for CBLW was ascertained by the CRA via the federal government\u2019s corporate directory database.\n[15] CBLW was assessed on April 30, 2018. At the time of assessment, CBLW was a dissolved corporation and had been since 2013. Pursuant to subsection 226(2) of the Canada Business Corporations Act (\u201cCBCA\u201d), the Minister had only two years to issue the assessment after the corporation dissolved. [2] Otherwise, the CRA would have had to take steps to revive the corporation prior to assessing. These steps were not taken. I also note that serious issues were raised as to whether CBLW received the notice of the assessment.\n[16] The Minister did not have the ability to assess CBLW when it did. It had been dissolved for five years at the time of the assessment. This is obviously longer than the two years permitted by subsection 226(2) of the CBCA. For that reason, I will proceed on the basis that CBLW was not properly assessed.\nA. The Transfers in Question\n[17] The transfers of property to two parties are central to this case.\n[18] The first transfer (\u201cFirst Transfer\u201d) saw Mr. Watts direct FA\u2019s account 785 to transfer $519,206.36 to CBLW\u2019s account 895. This transfer occurred between the dates of February 2, 2009, and May 26, 2010.\n[19] The second transfer (\u201cSecond Transfer\u201d) saw CBLW use account 895 to transfer a total of $138,550 to Peddle & Pollard LLP and Trust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d). The total of $138,550 was composed of an initial transfer of a cheque issued by CBLW for $20,000 to the Trust on August 30, 2009, and a subsequent transfer of $118,550 via bank draft from CBLW to the Trust on September 18, 2009.\n[20] The $138,550 transfer from CBLW to the Trust was at the direction of Mr. Watts. His signature was on both the cheque and the bank draft.\n[21] The purpose of the transfer of $138,550 to the Trust was to purchase a home in Markham, Ontario. The property was purchased via a purchase and sale agreement dated August 27, 2009. The agreement indicated that the home was to be purchased in the Appellant\u2019s name alone.\n[22] Mr. Watts was the directing mind who transferred the money from his bank account into CBLW\u2019s bank account and then caused CBLW to transfer money to the Trust to purchase a house in the Appellant\u2019s name. None of the transactions would have occurred if not for Mr. Watts. Mr. Watts did not dispute this conclusion in his testimony.\nB. The Appellant\u2019s Work for FA or CBLW\n[23] The Appellant testified that she worked for the FA during the years 2008 to 2011. She stated that her role included communicating with agents located across the country, collecting the required documents necessary to file the numerous returns, posting cheques, and other administrative duties. She further testified that during the tax season she worked close to sixty hours per week.\n[24] Mr. Watts testified that the Appellant performed work for CBLW during the years in question. He described her duties as including data entry, filing documents, and performing general administrative duties. It was never clarified whether the Appellant claimed services were provided to FA or CBLW.\n[25] Both Mr. Watts and the Appellant testified that her work was to be remunerated with the purchase of a home in her name. The Appellant further testified that this remuneration was included in a verbal contract between herself and Mr. Watts. This would effectively be a deferred payment, as no compensation was provided to the Appellant on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis. Although she claims to have continued working for FA until 2011, no further compensation was provided.\n[26] With respect to the work performed by the Appellant for the FA or CBLW, there was no evidence provided other than the Appellant and Mr. Watts\u2019 testimony. No documentation was provided to record the number of hours the Appellant worked or what hourly rate she was to be paid. No evidence was provided to document the tasks the Appellant completed while working for FA.\n[27] With respect to the remuneration provided to the Appellant by FA or CBLW for her work, there was no evidence before me of the agreement of service besides the Appellant\u2019s and Mr. Watts\u2019 testimony. There was no evidence to show that the Appellant received T4 income for her work. There was also no evidence to show that FA or CBLW recorded an expense or deduction for the remuneration of the Appellant\u2019s work. Furthermore, there was no evidence to show that the Appellant declared any employment or business income in 2009, the tax year in which she received the property in question.\n[28] Finally, there was a troubling contradiction in the Appellant\u2019s assertion that she received the home as compensation for services provided to FA. In the sentencing decision for Mr. Watts\u2019 criminal conviction, Justice Bale of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice indicated that Mr. Watts provided the home as a gift for his wife, as opposed for compensation. [3] This inconsistency was put to Mr. Watts in cross-examination in the present appeal. He did not accept that he characterized the house as a gift in either his criminal trial or sentencing.\nIII. POSITION OF THE APPELLANT\n[29] The Appellant argues that the appeal should be allowed for the following reasons:\na) The Minister has relied upon documents seized pursuant to a search warrant. An Ontario Superior Court of Justice has ordered these documents returned pursuant to subsection 490(9) of the Criminal Code. [4] The Appellant takes the position that the Respondent should never have had use of these documents and that the assessments therefore should be quashed. At the Appellant\u2019s request, I dealt with this motion at the outset of trial. I rejected the Appellant\u2019s argument in this motion. I will not refer to this argument in my decision;\nb) She was in the employ of CBLW, and contractually entitled to receive remuneration. The $138,550 she received was meant to remunerate for services rendered, so subsection 160(1) should not apply;\nc) The Tax Court should vacate the Appellant\u2019s subsection 160(1) assessment because the underlying assessment against CBLW was invalid. The Appellant argued that the CBLW assessment relied upon in her subsection 160(1) assessment was invalid for two reasons. First, the primary assessment was invalid because notice was not properly sent to CBLW. Second, CBLW was improperly assessed because it was a dissolved corporation under the CBCA at the time of assessment. These arguments focus on the assessment against CBLW and do not challenge the assessment against Mr. Watts. No evidence or argument was presented challenging the underlying assessment against Mr. Watts;\nd) Counsel for the Appellant also argued the Minister incorrectly assessed the Appellant under subsection 160(1) because there was no indirect transfer of property from Mr. Watts to the Appellant.\n[30] As previously noted, I am deciding this matter on the basis that CBLW was not properly assessed.\nIV. POSITION OF THE RESPONDENT\n[31] The Respondent stated in their submissions that:\na) Whether CBLW received a proper notice of assessment, or could even be assessed by the Minister in 2018 was not relevant because the subsection 160(1) tax liability arose at the time of property transfer to the Appellant and not from the assessment of CBLW;\nb) The First and Second Transfers (referred to above) constituted an indirect transfer from Mr. Watts to the Appellant. Therefore the subsection 160(1) assessment should be upheld;\nc) If the Court finds that there was not an indirect transfer between Mr. Watts and the Appellant through CBLW, then there was a direct transfer of property between Mr. Watts to CBLW and then to the Appellant. The Respondent argues that this would be a cascading subsection 160(1) assessment and therefore the appeal should be denied.\nV. ISSUES\n[32] The issue before the Court is whether, pursuant to subsection 160(1) of the Act, the Appellant is liable to pay $138,550 for the transfer of funds by Mr. Watts from account 785 to account 895 and then to assist in the purchase of a home for the Appellant\u2019s sole ownership.\n[33] In determining whether the Appellant is liable under subsection 160(1) of the Act, the two determinative questions in this appeal are:\n(i) Was there a transfer of property by Mr. Watts, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever to the Appellant?\n(ii) Did the fair market value of the property exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee?\nVI. LEGAL ANAYSIS\nA. Onus\n[34] At the outset, I find it necessary to briefly review the onus upon each party in their pleadings and at trial. I do this because of some concerns I have regarding the evidence.\n[35] Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) Rule 48(1) provides that for every appeal of an assessment under the Act, the Notice of Appeal shall be in Form 21(1)(a). [5] Form 21(1)(a) requires the taxpayer state the material facts relied upon by the Appellant in challenging the correctness of an assessment.\n[36] The burden is on the taxpayer to raise in the pleadings any dispute in law or fact. The Appellant must challenge the facts and assumptions pled by the Respondent in their respective pleadings. Failing to dispute facts via the pleadings leads to the Court accepting undisputed statements of fact to be true. [6]\n[37] At trial, the Appellant bears the onus of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumption of facts on a balance of probabilities. [7] If the Appellant fails to demolish the assumptions, the Minister\u2019s assumptions stand. However, it is not open to a trial judge to make a finding on a point not raised in the pleadings and where no evidence had been particularly directed to it. [8]\nB. The Appellant did not demolish the assumption that her tax liability was anything other than $138,550\n[38] The Appellant at no point challenged the ownership of the funds in account 785. This is despite the fact that Mr. Watts and Mr. Branch appear to be joint owners of this account. Therefore, I accept that Mr. Watts transferred at least $138,550 from account 785 to the eventual benefit of the Appellant.\n[39] Secondly, the assumption made by the Minister concerning the transfer of funds from account 785 to account 895 is as follows:\nj) on or about February 2, 2009 to May 26, 2010, the Spouse transferred a total of $519,203.36 from BMO account number ending in \u201c785\u201d to BMO account number ending in \u201c895\u201d.\n[40] What is most relevant to my decision is the transfer of funds from account 785 to account 895 up to and at the time the amount then found its way to the benefit of the Appellant. The ultimate transfer of property was the money used to purchase a house in the Appellant\u2019s name. The last date of this transfer was September 18, 2009.\n[41] The question becomes, how much has account 785 transferred to account 895 by September 18, 2009? While bank statements were provided at trial, this issue was not contested, nor even spoken to.\n[42] In my review of the bank statements for account 895, I found total amounts transferred from Mr. Watts to CBLW between Feb 2, 2009 and Sept 18, 2009 was $104,174.97. This total is derived from the Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents that lists account 785\u2019s transfers to account 895 between the dates in question. As to whether my calculation is correct, or missing further necessary analysis, I do not know.\n[43] The breakdown of the total of $104,174.97 is as follows:\nNo.\nDate\nAmount\n1\nFeb 2, 2009\n$100\n2\nJune 10, 2009\n$2724.97\n3\nJuly 31, 2009\n$5,400\n4\nAug 10, 2009\n$34,000\n5\nAug 14, 2009\n$14,500\n6\nAug 27, 2009\n$3,000\n7\nSept 4, 2009\n$23,150\n8\nSept 9, 2009\n$10,000\n9\nSept 18, 2009\n$11,300\nTOTAL\n$104,174.97\n[44] In the case before me, neither party challenged the total transfer amount of $138,550 in their respective pleadings, nor did any party dispute this amount at trial. The Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal, in paragraphs 34 to 38 appears to accept the basis that both an indirect transfer occurred and that a cascading subsection 160(1) assessment could also be upheld (subject to the consideration the Appellant provided for the benefit). The Appellant\u2019s later amended Notice of Appeal did not dispute this characterization either.\n[45] For these reasons, I find that the Appellant did not discharge her burden in showing that the assessment was incorrect in determining that $138,500 was transferred, indirectly from Mr. Watts to the Appellant.\nC. Necessary factors to uphold a subsection 160(1) assessment\n[46] Section 160 of the Act aims to prevent an indebted taxpayer from shielding their assets from the CRA. If a taxpayer transfers property to a non-arm's length person while owing taxes, the recipient of the transfer is liable for the taxpayer's tax debt. The transferee will owe the lesser of: (a) the fair market value of the property transferred, or (b) the transferor's debt.\n[47] The leading case on section 160 is Livingston3, which describes four criteria that must exist for subsection 160(1) to apply. They are as follows:\nThe transferor must be liable to pay tax under the Act at the time of transfer;\nThere must be a transfer of property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever;\nThe transferee must either be:\nThe transferor\u2019s spouse or common-law partner at the time of transfer or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner;\nA person who was under 18 years of age at the time of transfer; or\nA person with whom the transferor was not dealing at arm\u2019s length;\nThe fair market value of the property must exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee. [9]\n[48] Of the above noted criteria, the first and third criteria are not in dispute. Key facts that apply to these criteria are as follows:\nMr. Watts had a total tax debt owing of $404,452.17 at the end of 2009. This underlying debt was not challenged at trial;\nBetween February 2, 2009 to May 26, 2010 Mr. Watts transferred a total of $519,203.36 from account 785 to account 895;\nThe Appellant is married to Mr. Watts, and was so at the time of the transfer;\nA cheque for $20,000 dated August 30, 2009 from account 895 was issued to Peddle and Pollard Real Estate Lawyers for the purchase of a home in Markham Ontario;\nA bank draft of $118,550 from September 18, 2009 was issued from account 895 to Peddle and Pollard Real Estate Lawyers for the purchase of the same home in Markham Ontario;\nThe purchase and sale agreement for the Markham home was dated August 27, 2009;\nThe property was purchased in the Appellant\u2019s name only. It was never disputed that the Appellant received a benefit from the transfer of funds from the Mr. Watts to CBLW and then on to pay a portion of the purchase of a home.\nD. Mr. Watts transferred his personal funds\n[49] Mr. Watts carried on a sole proprietorship business between 2000 to approximately 2013. This sole proprietorship business used account 785.\n[50] The legal effect of a sole proprietorship is that there is no distinction between the individual\u2019s personhood and the personhood of the business. The Ontario Court of Appeal has found as follows:\n\u201c[f]rom a legal and practical standpoint, \"there is no separation between the sole proprietorship business organization and the person who is the sole proprietor\". As a result, \"all benefits from the business accrue to the sole proprietor and all obligations of the business are his responsibility\". [10]\n[51] I therefore find that the transfers from account 785 were transfers made from Mr. Watts personally.\nE. Cascading section 160 assessment\n[52] The Respondent argued that if I do not find there was an indirect transfer from Mr. Watts to Ms. Watts that I should find that a cascading section 160 assessment applies. [11]\n[53] I do not see a necessity to explore this alternative argument in depth based on my conclusion that an indirect transfer occured. I will say that if I were to have a difficulty finding this was an indirect transfer, I would find that a cascading assessment applies in this instance. I would do so even though there was not an assessment of CBLW (for reasons noted above).\n[54] The Appellant argued that CBLW not being assessed is fatal to the Minister\u2019s argument on a cascading assessment.\n[55] In disputing the assessment, the Appellant points out that subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii) was amended in 2013, after the date of the transfer. The amendment added the following (underlined):\n160(1)(e)(ii) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under the Act (including, for greater certainty, an amount that the transfer is liable to pay under this section, regardless of whether the Minister has made an assessment under subsection (2) for that amount) in or in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year. [12]\n[56] The Appellant argued that since this amendment to the section was not in the legislation in 2009, the Respondent could not rely upon this provision. Specifically, the Appellant argued that without a valid assessment of CBLW, the assessment against her could not stand.\n[57] I do not accept this argument for two reasons. First, the amended legislation was made to apply to assessments made after December 20, 2002. [13] Therefore, the new legislation did apply to the matter before the court.\n[58] Secondly, the amendment to the legislation was made for greater certainty. It simply legislated what the pre-existing jurisprudence had found. That is, with or without an assessment, the liability for the tax debt exists. [14] The assessment does not create the debt. The case law shows that an assessment is merely an established procedural or administrative means for determining tax payable. [15]\n[59] Therefore, even though CBLW has not been properly assessed, it still owed $404,452.17 as a result of the transfers of funds from Mr. Watts to CBLW. Then when CBLW transferred funds for the benefit of the Appellant, the Appellant became liable for the debt of CBLW up to the value of the funds transferred.\nF. Livingston Factors in Issue: Factor 2 and 4\n[60] As noted, two of the four factors listed in Livingstone have not been contested. Specifically, it has not been challenged that Mr. Watts, the transferor, was liable to pay taxes under the Act at the time of the transfer. It is also clear that the Appellant was Mr. Watts\u2019 spouse at the time of transfer.\n[61] The remaining issues are the following:\nWas there a transfer of property by Mr. Watts, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever to the Appellant?\nDid the fair market value of the property exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee?\nG. Mr. Watts indirectly transferred property to the Appellant\n[62] The word transfer is not defined in the Act. The word \u2018transfer\u2019 is not a term of art, but it rather carries the ordinary meaning of passing the possession of property from one person to another. [16]\n[63] The Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d) has held that:\n\u201cA direct transfer is a transaction by which one person transfers property to another. An indirect transfer would include a transaction by which one person transfers property to another through the hands of a third person.\u201d [17]\n[64] In other matters, this court has asked the following question in determining if there has been a transfer of property: Has the transferor divested itself from an asset in such a way that it has been impoverished and the transferee has been correspondingly enriched? [18] In this appeal, the answer is a clear yes.\n[65] The movement of funds from account 785 through account 895 to eventually assisting the Appellant in purchasing a home was obviously not a direct transfer from Mr. Watts to the Appellant. However, subsection 160(1) specifically states that it also applies to indirect transfers.\n[66] An indirect transfer under subsection 160(1) refers to \u201cany circuitous way in which property of any kind passes from one person to another.\u201d [19]\n[67] In the case before me, Mr. Watts was the sole director of CBLW and FA. He was the directing mind who transferred the money from his bank account, into CBLW\u2019s bank account, and then caused CBLW to transfer money to the Trust to assist in the purchase of a house for the Appellant. His signature was on both the bank draft and the cheque forwarded to the lawyer for the purchase of the home. None of the transfers of the cash would have occurred if not for Mr. Watts\u2019 direction.\nH. Does the Respondent have to prove the intention of the transferor in order to prove an indirect transfer occurred?\n[68] I reject the Appellant\u2019s argument that an indirect transfer from Mr. Watts to the Appellant did not occur because there was no proof that Mr. Watts, at the time of the First Transfer, intended to later effect the Second Transfer for the benefit of the Appellant.\n[69] The Appellant\u2019s counsel based this argument on an example of an indirect transfer described by the FCA. The statement is as follows:\n\u201cSection 160 applies to \"direct\" transfers and \"indirect\" transfers. A direct transfer is a transaction by which one person transfers property to another. An indirect transfer would include a transaction by which one person transfers property to another through the hands of a third person. For example, if A gives B a gift of $100 in cash, then A has made a direct transfer of $100 to B. If A gives B $100 in cash on the condition or with the expectation that B will give C $100 in cash, and B gives C $100 in cash, then A has made an indirect transfer of $100 to C.\u201d [20] [Emphasis added]\n[70] I note that this comment is made in obiter by Justice Sharlow. Furthermore, when read in context, I do not accept that the FCA was attempting to limit the definition of an indirect transfer in this statement. Later on in the decision, Justice Sharlow notes at paragraph 65(6) that an assessment can stand even if the Minister cannot show an intent to avoid tax. If the FCA wanted to limit the scope of an indirect transfer in the manner described by the Appellant\u2019s counsel, they would have done so explicitly.\n[71] The FCA was clear in Eyeball Networks Inc v Canada that the phrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly, by any means of a trust of by any other means whatsoever\u201d captures \u201call forms of transfers including those resulting from the combined effect of multiple transactions, whether preordained or not.\u201d [21] [Emphasis added].\n[72] There is no question that subsection 160(1) can apply to a multi-step transfer of property such as the matter before the Court. On my reading of Medland and Eyeball Networks, the jurisprudence on this issue is clear: an indirect transfer under subsection 160(1) captures all non-direct transfers and does not require proof of an expectation for a second party to eventually effect a transfer to a third party.\n[73] Additionally, the facts of this case do indicate that Mr. Watts wished to use the funds of account 785 to eventually enrich his wife. He was the party that directed the transfer of funds to CBLW. He then directed payments to go to the benefit of the Appellant in the purchase of the home. Mr. Watts testified that he intended to compensate his wife in August-September 2009 by assisting in purchasing the home for her.\n[74] Even if having an intention to effect a second transfer was required to make a finding of an indirect transfer, I would find that Mr. Watts, in transferring funds to CBLW, always intended to use a portion of those funds to enrich the Appellant.\n[75] Accordingly, I find that there was an indirect transfer from Mr. Watts to the Appellant for $138,550.\nI. Ms. Watts did not provide consideration\n[76] The Minister has assumed the following:\nNo consideration was provided by the Appellant to CBLW in exchange for the funds.\n[77] The FCA in Livingston spoke about the issue of when consideration is provided by the transferee:\nUnder subsection 160(1), a transferee of property will be liable to the CRA to the extent that the fair market value of the consideration given for the property falls short of the fair market value of that property. The very purpose of subsection 160(1) is to preserve the value of the existing assets in the taxpayer for collection by the CRA. Where those assets are entirely divested, subsection 160(1) provides that the CRA's rights to those assets can be exercised against the transferee of the property. However, subsection 160(1) will not apply where an amount equivalent in value to the original property transferred was given to the transferor at the time of transfer: that is, fair market value consideration. This is because after such a transaction, the CRA has not been prejudiced as a creditor. [22]\n[78] In a situation where an Appellant claims that consideration was provided for the benefit, a trial judge should conduct an analysis of the fair market value of the consideration claimed to have been provided. [23] In this instance, the evidentiary burden is on the Appellant to provide evidence that she provided services that were of sufficient consideration so that the assessment should not stand.\n[79] The Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal and submissions at trial argued that she provided various services to CBLW that should be treated as consideration for the amounts transferred to her by Mr. Watts.\n[80] However, the Appellant, in her testimony, seemed unsure as to whether she provided services to CBLW or FA. The Appellant claimed to perform numerous tasks for FA, amounting to as much as 60 hours a week. Both she and Mr. Watts provided similar testimony in this respect to the work she performed.\n[81] In describing her compensation, the Appellant stated the following (which is about the best description of her compensation provided at trial):\nQ. Okay. So Mr. Watts testified that you were paid for kind of the function rather than by an hourly or monthly wage, is that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you tell me more about that? What- how much- how much was agreed upon for each function that you performed?\nA. How much was the rate?\nQ. Mhm.\nA. There was no rate.\nQ. Okay, so....\nA. It- honestly, it was just get me a deposit on the house and this is my value. I will do what it is that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s necessary in the office. There was never any discussion of rate. I was just happy with the deposit on the house.\n[82] Upon reviewing all the evidence before me, I have tried to analyze whether I accept the magnitude of services the Appellant claims to have provided and, secondly, whether the compensation she received is proportional to those services. Unfortunately, I have very little to work with in this regard. The evidence provided by the Appellant and Mr. Watts was scant and had no supporting detail and no corroboration. It was also contradicted in the criminal court sentencing decision of Mr. Watts that was put before me. [24]\n[83] In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, no explanation was given as to why the Appellant took the entirety of her payment in two lump sums, neither of which were paid directly to her. These payments were made in their entirety in August and September 2009. Yet she testified that she continued her services until 2011. Her evidence was that she did not receive payment for these future years.\n[84] No evidence was provided of the Appellant taking these payments as income through a T4 slip or as business income. Mr. Watts believed the Appellant was a contractor for CBLW. No evidence of any sort was provided as to an expense taken for these payments by either CBLW or FA.\n[85] Given the inconsistency of what was written by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the funds were a gift for his wife) and the lack of logic in the payment method to the Appellant, there was an insufficient amount of evidence before me to find that the Appellant provided consideration.\n[86] Ultimately, the Appellant has not adduced sufficient evidence to support her position that she provided consideration for the $138,550 transferred to her for her benefit. The lack of documentation and the vagueness of the testimony is fatal to her argument.\nVII. CONCLUSION\n[87] I find that Mr. Watts indirectly transferred to the Appellant, his wife, the amount of $138,550 in 2009. At the time of transfer, Mr. Watts was liable to pay tax under the Act for the amount of $404,452.17 (year end 2009). The Appellant was therefore properly assessed the amount of $138,550. The appeal is denied.\n[88] Costs are payable by the Appellant.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 25th day of January 2023.\n\u201cR.

For example, suppose that A, who owes tax of $100, makes an unconditional gift of $100 to B, who is his spouse. Then suppose that B makes an unconditional gift of $100 to C, her sister. Section 160 would permit the Minister to assess B for the $100 Primary tax liability of A, so that A and B would be jointly and severally liable for the $100 primary tax liability of A. Section 160 would also permit the Minister to assess C for the $100 vicarious liability of B. The net effect would be that A, B and C would be jointly and severally liable for the same $100 primary tax liability of A. There will have been no indirect transfers, but two direct transfers, one from A to B, and the other from B to C. However, the risk to C of being assessed under section 160 is the same as if there had been an indirect transfer of $100 from A to C.\u201d [Addison & Leyen].\n[12] Technical Tax Amendments Act, 2012, SC 2013, c 34 at s 313(1).\n[13] Ibid at s 313(8).\n[14] See Jurak v Canada, 2003 FCA 58.\n[15] Dauphinais c R, [1993] 1 CTC 2288 at para 12, 94 DTC 1148 (TCC); Minister of National Revenue v Parsons, [1983] CTC 321, 83 DTC 5329 (TCC); Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co v The Queen, [1984] 1CTC 190 at para 27, 84 DTC 6197 (TCC), upheld on aff\u2019d Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co v The Queen, [1986] 1 CTC 423, 86 DTC 6154 (FCA).\n[16] Medland v Canada, [1998] 52 DTC 6358 at para 17, 4 CTC 293 [Medland].\n[17] Addison & Leyen, supra note 11 at para 53.\n[18] Algoa Trust v The Queen, [1993] 1 CTC 2294 at paras 49, 51, 93 DTC 405.\n[19] Medland, supra note 16 at para 20.\n[20] Addison & Leyen, supra note 11 at para 53.\n[21] Eyeball Networks Inc v Canada, 2021 FCA 17 at para 48 [Eyeball Networks].\n[22] Livingston, supra note 9 at para 27.\n[23] In Livingston v R, 2007 TCC 303, the trial judge simply concluded that consideration provided by the Appellant was \u201cadequate\u201d with little or no analysis performed.

(2) Where a proceeding is discontinued under subsection (1), it is deemed to be dismissed as of the day on which the Court receives the written notice.\n[3] As a result the two appeals were dismissed on the date that the letter was received. This has the same effect as a Judgment dismissing an appeal.\n[4] The Appellant now seeks to have the dismissals set aside. [1]\n[5] The reason given is that the Appellant believed that no monies were owing and only learned after withdrawing the appeals that there were still withholdings plus interest owing.\n[6] It is well established that once the Court has rendered judgment dealing with an appeal, the court has fulfilled its function and, subject only to very limited exceptions, may no longer deal with the matter.\n[7] There are no specific provisions in the Tax Court of Canada Act, Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure respecting the Employment Insurance Act or the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure respecting the Employment Insurance Act that deal with setting aside judgments.\n[8] However, this Court has an implied jurisdiction allowing it to deal with procedural and evidentiary matters to the extent that they are not dealt with in the Tax Court of Canada Act, the relevant regulations made under that Act or any other applicable law. There is no directly applicable law or regulation.\n[9] While section 172 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) does not apply to Employment Insurance or Canada Pension Plan proceedings in the court, it may usefully be considered in applying this court\u2019s implied jurisdiction given that it sets out the factors usually considered by courts in deciding whether or not a judgment should be set aside or amended.\n[10] Section 172 says:\n(1) A judgment that,\n(a) contains an error arising from an accidental slip or omission, or\n(b) requires amendment in any matter on which the Court did not adjudicate,\nmay be amended by the Court on application or of its own motion.\n(2) A party who seeks to,\n(a) have a judgment set aside or varied on the ground of fraud or of facts arising or discovered after it was made,\n(b) suspend the operation of a judgment, or\n(c) obtain other relief than that originally directed.\nmay make a motion for the relief claimed.\n[11] The only part of section 172 that could be relevant is part of paragraph 172(2)(a). Given that no fraud is alleged, the question whether there are \u201cfacts arising or discovered\u201d after the judgment that could, in the circumstances, justify setting aside the Judgment.\n[12] Subsection 172 is permissive and the jurisprudence has established criteria to consider in deciding whether or not to set aside a judgment.\n[13] As set out by Justice Monaghan, as she then was, in Supavititpatana v. The Queen [2] in applying section 172 :\n\u2026 regardless of how sympathetic a taxpayer\u2019s circumstances might be, this Court should not exercise this power lightly. As the Federal Court of Appeal has said, \u201cthere is more at stake here on this issue than sympathy:\n\u2026 In other words, setting aside a judgment is an exceptional measure because the finality of litigation is desirable and fundamental to the efficient and proper administration of justice. There is a:\n\u2026 need, in the public interest, to put an end to litigation. A party is certainly entitled to assume as a general rule that litigation has been brought to an end when an appeal is deemed to be dismissed. It is entitled to assume that the dead proceeding will not be resurrected. . .\n(footnotes omitted)\nand [3]\n\u2026 the applicant must establish three things: (i) new facts arose or are discovered after the judgment; (ii) the new facts could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered before the judgment; and (iii) the new facts would probably have resulted in a different judgment had they initially been brought forward. \u2026 Obviously, the new facts must be ones that would have affected the judgment. Moreover, as in the case of fraud, the applicant has some responsibility to exercise due diligence to discover the relevant facts before the judgment is issued.\n(footnotes omitted)\n[14] Based on the Appellant\u2019s submissions I am not satisfied that the fact that there were still amounts owing could not have been discover with reasonable diligence prior to the letter of 2 September 2022. [4]\n[15] Accordingly, the Motion is dismissed without costs.\nThis Judgment and Reasons for Judgment is issued in substitution for the Judgment dated January 26, 2023 to correct the style of cause.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 31st day of January 2023.\n\u201cG.

However, the Respondent did not challenge the facts alleged in the Appellant\u2019s letter. In the circumstances, given that the Respondent did not challenge the facts alleged, given that subsection 18.15(3) of the Tax Court of Canada Act provides that \u201cthe Court is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting a hearing and the appeal shall be dealt with by the Court as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit\u201d and given that, in any event, the alleged facts do not form a basis for setting aside the Judgment, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to decide the matter in the absence of an Affidavit much as one might deal with an application to strike a Notice of Appeal on the basis that it discloses no grounds for appeal.\n",

(\u201cBombardier\u201d) as a commuter train operator.\nAs a commuter train operator, the Appellant was required to work from various train stations across Ontario.\nThe Appellant resided in the unincorporated community of Picton, located in Prince Edward County, in the Province of Ontario.\nBombardier\u2019s home terminal was Union Station in the administrative district of Etobicoke, in the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario.\nThe Appellant electronically filed his 2014 and 2015 income tax returns on May 7, 2015 and on April 30, 2016, respectively.\nIn computing the Appellant\u2019s net income for the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the Appellant:\nClaimed a deduction for employment expenses of $17,605 and $20,407, respectively; and\nReported taxable income of $130,640 and $110,729, respectively.\nThe Appellant claimed employment expenses in the following amounts:\n2014\n2015\nLodging\n$11,082.00\n$14,695.60\nOther Business Expenses\n$547.00\nN\/A\nMeals\n$5,975.50\n$5,712.00\nTotal\n$17,604.50\n$20,407.60\nThe minister initially assessed the Appellant\u2019s 2014 and 2015 taxation years as filed; the notices were dated May 19, 2015 and May 9, 2016, respectively. Please see attached Schedule \u201cA\u201d and Schedule \u201cB\u201d.\nThe Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) reassessed the Appellant for the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, in accordance with the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Notices of Reassessments (\u201cReassessments\u201d) were dated October 20, 2016. Please see attached Schedule \u201cC\u201d.\nIn her reassessments, the Minister denied employment expenses claimed by the Appellant of $17,604.50 for the 2014 tax year, and $20,407.60 for the 2015 tax year.\nOn November 3, 2016, the Appellant served the Minister with a Notice of Objection to the Minister\u2019s reassessments of his 2014 and 2015 tax years. Pleases see attached Schedule \u201cD\u201d.\nThe Minister confirmed the reassessments and issued a Notice of Confirmation, dated August 17, 2017. Please see attached Schedule \u201cE\u201d.\nThe Parties agree that the Appellant incurred expenses of $17,604.50 and $20,407.60 for 2014 and 2015 taxation years, respectively.\nThe Appellant\u2019s employer, Bombardier, provided the Appellant with T2200 forms for the subject years. Please see attached Schedule \u201cF\u201d and Schedule \u201cG\u201d.\nUnder the \u201cConditions of Employment Section\u201d, Bombardier stated that the Appellant was required to travel to locations that were not his place of business during the course of performing his employment duties. It also noted that it required the Appellant to be away for at least twelve (12) consecutive hours from the municipality and metropolitan area of its business where the employee routinely reported for work.\nAt the same time, Bombardier stated on the T2200 forms that it does not reimburse employment expenses incurred by its employees.\nThe parties agree that the T2200 form does not allow the Appellant to claim telecommunication expenses.\n[5] Mr. Michaluk testified at the hearing. He explained that, in an usual working week, he would leave Picton on Sunday afternoon for Oshawa by driving his car and would returned back home on Friday evening after his shift. The driving distance between Picton and Oshawa is approximately 160 kilometres which represents a driving time between 1h45 minutes to 2 hours.\n[6] The Appellant further explained that in 2014 and 2015 he usually started and finished work at the Oshawa Go Train Station and not at Bombardier\u2019s home terminal located at Etobicoke in the City of Toronto.\n[7] While away from home, he stayed at the Travelodge Oshawa which was closed to the Oshawa Go Train Station. However, the Appellant mentioned that, in 2014, he rented an apartment in Pickering for a period of 6 to 7 months at a cost of $9,500 and that, in 2015, he rented another apartment for an undetermined period at a cost of $5,520. He said that the apartments at Pickering were closed to the Pickering Go Train Station and that, even when he stayed in the City of Pickering, he continued to report to work at the Oshawa Go Train Station.\n[8] The Appellant explained that, as a commuter train operator, he was required to work from various train stations forming part of the Go Transit located in the Province of Ontario.\n[9] As stated in the Statement of Agreed Facts (Partial), Bombardier, the Appellant\u2019s employer provided the Appellant with T2200 forms for the subject years. When cross-examined about the forms, the Appellant stated that he did prepare the forms and did submit them to his employer for signature.\n[10] The Appellant\u2019s employer also signed forms TL2 \u201cClaims for meals and lodging expenses\u201d that the Appellant attached to his tax returns for 2014 and 2015. Again, the Appellant stated that he did prepare the forms and that he did submit them to his employer for signature. The signatory of the said forms did not require receipts for the amounts of expenses claimed.\n[11] During his testimony, the Appellant declared that his daily work shift was more than 12 hours per day and he reported information about specific routes showing that. When cross-examined concerning his daily work shift, the Appellant recognized that many routes last less than 12 hours and were subject to split shifts with interruption times of between 2 to 4 hours.\n[12] The Respondent is relying on paragraph 8(1)g) and subsection 8(2) of the Act to deny the Appellant\u2019s claims of employment expenses. Paragraph 8(1)g) and subsection 8(2) of the Act read as follows:\nTransport employee\u2019s expenses\n(g) where the taxpayer was an employee of a person whose principal business was passenger, goods, or passenger and goods transport and the duties of the employment required the taxpayer, regularly,\n(i) to travel, away from the municipality where the employer\u2019s establishment to which the taxpayer reported for work was located and away from the metropolitan area, if there is one, where it was located, on vehicles used by the employer to transport the goods or passengers, and\n(ii) while so away from that municipality and metropolitan area, to make disbursements for meals and lodging,\namounts so disbursed by the taxpayer in the year to the extent that the taxpayer has not been reimbursed and is not entitled to be reimbursed in respect thereof;\nGeneral limitation\n(2) Except as permitted by this section, no deductions shall be made in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment.\n[13] Paragraph 8(1)g) provided relief to those individuals employed in the transportation industry who are regularly required to be away from their home municipality.\n[14] In Robert Elwood v. The Queen (2012 TCC 313), Justice Campbell described the conditions of application of paragraph 8(1)g) as follows:\n9 The preconditions, that must be met if paragraph 8(1)(g) is to be applied, are: (1) The employer's principal business must be transporting passengers, goods or a combination of passengers and goods. (2) The taxpayer is required by his or her duties of employment to regularly travel away from the municipality where the employer's establishment, to which the taxpayer reported to work, was located. (3) The taxpayer must be travelling on vehicles used by the employer to transport those goods or passengers. (4) The taxpayer is required by his or her duties of employment to regularly travel away from the metropolitan area, if there is one, where the employer's establishment, to which the taxpayer reported to work, was located. (5) Finally, the taxpayer is required by his or her duties of employment to make disbursements for meals and lodging while so away from that municipality and metropolitan area. If these preconditions are met, a taxpayer may deduct amounts disbursed to the extent the taxpayer was not reimbursed and is not otherwise entitled to be reimbursed in respect thereof.\n[15] In cases of this kind, the onus is on the Appellant to show that the reassessment is in error and this can be established on a balance of probability. Furthermore, because paragraph 8(1)g) is an exception to the general limitation rule of subsection 8(2) of the Act, it should be strictly interpreted.\n[16] Based on the evidence before me, the Appellant has not established that his duties of employment required him, regularly, to travel away from Oshawa and away from the metropolitan area where his employer is located and while so away to make disbursements for meals and lodging.\n[17] The City of Oshawa is in the Durham Region which is in the Greater Toronto Area. The Appellant has not established that the employment expenses that he claimed were incurred outside the metropolitan area where he reported to work.\n[18] The deductions under paragraph 8(1)g) of the Act is not intended for employees who decide, for personal reasons, not to return to their homes at the end of each working day.\n[19] For all these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, this 25th day of January 2023.\n\u201cR\u00e9al Favreau\u201d\nFavreau J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 15\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2017-3876(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJOHN MICHALUK AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nToronto, Ontario\nDATE OF HEARING:\nAugust 17, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice R\u00e9al Favreau\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nJanuary 25, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nAvery Kalpin\nJeff Kirshen\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nGeorge Lin\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nAvery Kalpin\nJeff Kirshen\nFirm:\nRosen Kirshen Tax Law\nFor the Respondent:\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle\nDeputy Attorney General of Canada\nOttawa, Canada\n",

The King\nCourt (s) Database\nTax Court of Canada Judgments\nDate\n2023-02-02\nNeutral citation\n2023 TCC 16\nFile numbers\n2021-2506(IT)APP\nJudges and Taxing Officers\nGaston Jorr\u00e9\nSubjects\nIncome Tax Act\nDecision Content\nCitation: 2023 TCC 16\nDate: 20230202\nDocket: 2021-2506(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nBRANDON OSADCHUCK,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nFor the applicant: The Applicant himself\nAgent for the respondent: Boma Jumbo\nORDER AND REASONS FOR ORDER\nThe applicant seeks an order to extend the time to file a notice of appeal with respect to the 2007 taxation year. The representative of the respondent has written to the court to say that the minister does not oppose the application.\nTime extension applications are governed by section 167 of the Income Tax Act and subsection 167(5) sets out the requirements for making an order. That subsection reads:\n(5) When order to be made \u2014 No order shall be made under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time limited by section 169 for appealing; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by section 169 for appealing the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer's name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to appeal,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application,\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted, and\n(iv) there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.\n(Emphasis added.)\nGenerally, where an application is not opposed and on the face of the application, it would appear that the conditions are met, the court will grant the time extension.\nHowever, it is well settled that the parties cannot extend the jurisdiction of the court and it is ultimately this court that must be satisfied that that the conditions are met.\nJustice Webb, as he then was, stated In Johnston v. R [1] :\nIn my opinion, the statutory requirement that an applicant demonstrate that there are reasonable grounds for the appeal is a condition that must be satisfied in order for this Court to have the jurisdiction to issue the order extending the time within which an appeal may be instituted and it is not a requirement that can be waived by the Respondent. It is not a requirement that is imposed solely for the benefit of the Respondent. The requirement that an applicant demonstrate that there are reasonable grounds for the appeal is a condition precedent to this Court issuing the requested order.\nI agree.\nNot including the signature page, the proposed notice of appeal attached contains eight pages with few facts and much argument. Among other things, it invokes the Constitution Act, 1982, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as a number of legal decisions.\nThe gist of the applicant\u2019s position appears to be that:\nHe is unlawfully being forced to accept the status of a legal person. Further, he has the right to only be recognized as a human being.\nAlthough expressed somewhat differently, this has a striking resemblance to what has often been referred to as \u201cnatural persons\u201d arguments.\nThe threshold for \u201creasonable grounds of appeal\u201d is not high. See, for example the comments of Justice Smith in Ross Johnson v. HMTQ. [2]\nHowever, there must be at least some possibility of success.\nOn its face, the proposed notice of appeal in this application appears to be without merit and does not demonstrate reasonable grounds for the appeal. [3]\nAccordingly, the Application should proceed to hearing.\nIT IS ORDERED THAT THIS APPLICATION BE SET DOWN FOR HEARING.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 2nd day of February 2023.\n\u201cGaston Jorr\u00e9\u201d\nJorr\u00e9 D.J.\n[1] 2009 TCC 327 at paragraph 26.\n[2] 2019 TCC 13 at paragraph 23.\n[3] The apparent merits are not strengthened by a letter to the court from the appellant dated December 13, 2022 in which the appellant advises that he intends to oppose the application for an extension of time. Nor is it strengthened by a document dated January 23, 2023 filed by the applicant that is entitled \u201cNotice of Application of Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d.\n",

The Appellant says it does while the Crown says it does not.\n[2] The only provision at issue is subsection 146.2(6) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) [1] :\n146.2(6) No tax is payable under this Part by a trust that is governed by a TFSA on its taxable income for a taxation year, except that, if at any time in the taxation year, it carries on one or more businesses or holds one or more properties that are non-qualified investments (as defined in subsection 207.01(1)) for the trust, tax is payable under this Part by the trust on the amount that would be its taxable income for the taxation year if it had no incomes or losses from sources other than those businesses and properties, and no capital gains or capital losses other than from dispositions of those properties, . . .\n146.2(6) Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie par une fiducie r\u00e9gie par un compte d\u2019\u00e9pargne libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur son revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Toutefois, si, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, la fiducie exploite une ou plusieurs entreprises ou d\u00e9tient un ou plusieurs biens qui sont, pour elle, des placements non admissibles, au sens du paragraphe 207.01(1), l\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu par la pr\u00e9sente partie est \u00e0 payer par la fiducie sur la somme qui correspondrait \u00e0 son revenu imposable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e si ses seules sources de revenu ou de perte \u00e9taient ces entreprises ou ces biens et ses seuls gains en capital ou pertes en capital d\u00e9coulaient de la disposition de ces biens. . . .\n[3] The words at issue are italicized for emphasis:\n146.2(6) No tax is payable under this Part by a trust that is governed by a TFSA on its taxable income for a taxation year, except that, if at any time in the taxation year, it carries on one or more businesses ... tax is payable under this Part by the trust . . .\n[emphasis added]\n146.2(6) Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie par une fiducie r\u00e9gie par un compte d\u2019\u00e9pargne libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur son revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Toutefois, si, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, la fiducie exploite une ou plusieurs entreprises ... l'imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu par la pr\u00e9sente partie est \u00e0 payer par la fiducie . . .\n[nous soulignons]\n[4] In reassessing, the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) concluded that the Appellant \u201ccarried on a business through its trading activities\u201d in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. [2] On the contrary, the Appellant takes the position that \u201cbuying and selling qualified investments does not constitute carrying on a business for purposes of subsection 146.2(6).\u201d [3] The parties do not differ on the facts. Neither party called any witnesses as they filed a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts setting out all relevant facts.\n[5] In its recent decision in Rogers Communications, the Federal Court of Appeal concisely summarized the considerations and authorities relevant to the judicial exercise of statutory interpretation:\n[17] Whether the Competition Tribunal could consider the actual, real matter\u2014the merger and divestiture rather than just the merger\u2014comes down to what the Competition Act says. To decide that, we analyze the text, context and purpose of the relevant parts of the Act. We do this neutrally, dispassionately and objectively, as lawyers who happen to have a judicial commission, not as policymakers or politicians. Nor do we fiddle around with the authentic meaning of the legislation passed by our elected representatives\u2014for example, by injecting our own preferred policies or personal preferences into the analysis to skew the result. See Williams v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FCA 252, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 174 at paras. 41-50 and Hillier v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 44, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 556, citing controlling authorities of the Supreme Court such as Re Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, 154 D.L.R. (4th) 193, Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 and Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601. See also the recent Supreme Court authorities to similar effect in TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman, 2019 SCC 19, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 144, R. v. Rafilovich, 2019 SCC 51, 442 D.L.R. (4th) 539 and Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 147. [4]\n[6] Against this backdrop, the Appellant invited me to apply to a TFSA trust a provision of the Act specifically allowing a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (\u201cRRSP\u201d) to remain exempt from tax if it carries on a business of trading qualified investments.\n[7] For the reasons described below under the heading \u201cTextual, Contextual, and Purposive Analysis\u201d, I decline the Appellant\u2019s invitation to apply a provision that Parliament included in the statutory scheme governing RRSPs but chose not to include in the statutory scheme governing TFSA trusts.\n[8] As a result of that analysis, I have concluded that income earned by a TFSA trust from carrying on any business, including a business of trading qualified investments, is taxable under subsection 146.2(6) of the Act. As the Appellant carried on a business of trading qualified investments during the years at issue, the appeals must be dismissed.\nThe Appellant\n[9] The Appellant is Canadian Western Trust Company as Trustee of the Fareed Ahamed TFSA. Mr. Ahamed is a professional investor, and an investment advisor, in West Vancouver, British Columbia. [5]\n[10] Mr. Ahamed opened a TFSA trust of which he was beneficiary and holder on January 2, 2009. Canadian Western Trust Company was trustee and issuer of the TFSA trust. [6] It was a self\u2011directed TFSA trust, meaning that Mr. Ahamed directed all purchases and sales of securities. [7]\n[11] All securities purchased and sold by the TFSA trust were \u201cqualified investments\u201d within the meaning of subsection 207.01(1) of the Act. Most were non-dividend paying and speculative in nature. The majority were penny stocks listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in the junior mining sector. The TFSA trust owned most of the shares for only a short period. [8]\n[12] Mr. Ahamed capitalized the TFSA trust by making the maximum allowable contribution of $5,000 in early January 2009, 2010, and 2011. [9] Mr. Ahamed\u2019s contributions to the TFSA trust in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and the value of the TFSA trust at the end of each of these years, are shown in the table below:\nTaxation Year\nAnnual contribution to the TFSA trust at the start of the year\nCumulative contributions to the TFSA trust\nValue of the TFSA trust at year end\n2009\n$5,000\n$5,000\n$54,269.74 [10]\n2010\n$5,000\n$10,000\n$420,965.14 [11]\n2011\n$5,000\n$15,000\n$617,371.24 [12]\n[13] At the end of 2012 the total value of the TFSA trust was $564,482.90. [13] The TFSA trust sold its securities and transferred the proceeds of $547,788.83 to its holder, Mr. Ahamed, in January 2013. [14]\nThe Reassessments at Issue and Subsection 146.2(6) of the Income Tax Act\n[14] The Minister reassessed tax to the Appellant for each of the Appellant\u2019s 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 taxation years. [15] The underlying theory of the reassessments is that the Appellant carried on a business of trading qualified investments in each of those years and, therefore, its income from carrying on that business during each of those years was subject to Part I tax under subsection 146.2(6) of the Act.\n[15] The Minister reassessed Part I tax to the Appellant on the basis that its taxable income was $44,270 in 2009, $180,190 in 2010, $330,994 [16] in 2011, and $14,027 in 2012. [17] These are the reassessments before the Court.\nThe Appellant\u2019s Argument\n[16] The Appellant argues that the Court should use a textual, contextual, and purposive analysis [18] and must apply the \u201cresidual presumption\u201d in favour of the taxpayer if a textual, contextual, and purposive analysis fails to produce a result. [19]\nA. An RRSP May Carry on Business Trading Qualified Investments\n[17] The Appellant relies heavily on the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (\u201cRRSP\u201d) provisions of the Act and, in particular, paragraph 146(4)(b) which, during the years at issue, effectively exempted from Part I tax any income earned by an RRSP from carrying on a business of trading qualified investments:\n146(4) . . . no tax is payable under this Part by a trust on the taxable income of the trust for a taxation year if, throughout the period in the year during which the trust was in existence, the trust was governed by a registered retirement savings plan, except that\n***\n(b) . . . if the trust has carried on any business or businesses in the year, tax is payable under this Part by the trust on the amount, if any, by which\n(i) the amount that its taxable income for the year would be if it had no incomes or losses from sources other than from that business or those businesses, as the case may be,\nexceeds\n(ii) such portion of the amount determined under subparagraph 146(4)(b)(i) in respect of the trust for the year as can reasonably be considered to be income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments for the trust; . . .\n[emphasis added]\n[18] Under paragraph 146(4)(b) of the Act, an RRSP remains entirely tax\u2011exempt even if it carried on a business of trading qualified investments.\nB. Parliament\u2019s Only Purpose in Taxing Income From Carrying on Business is to Prevent Unfair Competition\n[19] The Appellant argues that Parliament has enacted safeguards to prevent registered charities, non-profit organizations, and pension real estate corporations from competing unfairly with taxable entities. With respect to charities, Parliament has made them taxable on \u201cunrelated business income\u201d. With respect to non-profit organizations, Parliament allows them to undertake significant business activities but only if the \u201cpreponderant purpose\u201d of those activities is connected to the organization\u2019s non\u2011profit activities. With respect to pension real estate corporations, Parliament requires them to hold real property as capital property and not inventory.\n[20] The only issue Parliament is concerned with in such circumstances is unfair competition between exempt entities and taxable entities.\n[21] There could have been no legislative purpose for making a TFSA trust taxable on the income from carrying on a business of trading qualified investments when an RRSP carrying on the very same business is not taxable. Why is that the case? First, RRSPs and TFSAs are \u201cmirror images\u201d of each other and offer identical after-tax rates of return. [20] Second, carrying on a business of trading qualified investments in an RRSP or a TFSA trust creates no competition at all with taxable entities carrying on the same business.\n[22] The Appellant, therefore, contends there would have been no rational legislative purpose for Parliament to tax a TFSA trust carrying on a business of trading qualified investments while exempting an RRSP carrying on the very same business.\nC. The Court Should Adopt a New Test for \u201cCarrying on Business\u201d\n[23] The Appellant focuses on the traditional test used by the courts to distinguish between securities transactions on income account and those on capital account (the \u201ctraditional test\u201d) [21] . The elements of the traditional test include:\n(a) frequency of transactions;\n(b) period of ownership;\n(c) knowledge of securities markets;\n(d) security transactions forming part of the taxpayer\u2019s ordinary business;\n(e) time spent researching securities markets and potential purchases;\n(f) the extent to which debt financing is used;\n(g) advertising; and\n(h) in the case of shares, whether they are speculative in nature or dividend-paying.\n[24] The Appellant argues that the traditional test was not judicially created with a view to determining whether a non-taxable entity, such as a TFSA trust, was carrying on a business of trading qualified investments. This Court should, therefore, craft a new test recognizing that TFSA investors are obliged to follow a set of restrictions that do not apply to taxable investors:\nStatutory restrictions on TFSA investors include:\nTaxable investors may undertake the following activities without any statutory restriction:\n(a) cannot contribute more than the TFSA dollar limit each year;\n(a) may contribute as much as they can afford to invest each year;\n(b) cannot deduct annual contributions in computing income;\n(b) may deduct in computing income amounts borrowed to purchase investments;\n(c) cannot borrow within the TFSA trust;\n(c) may borrow as much as a lender will advance to purchase investments;\n(d) cannot deduct interest on borrowed money used to contribute to a TFSA;\n(d) may deduct interest on the money borrowed;\n(e) cannot apply losses incurred in the TFSA trust against income realized outside of the TFSA trust;\n(e) may apply investment losses against investment income;\n(f) cannot invest in non-qualified investments;\n(f) may invest in anything;\n(g) cannot sell short; and\n(g) may go long or sell short; and\n(h) cannot enter into hedging transactions.\n(h) may hedge their exposure to risk.\n[25] The Appellant argues that an individual investing within a TFSA trust and an individual investing outside a TFSA trust would use different investment strategies. For example, a taxable investor may sell short in a bear market while a TFSA investor is precluded from doing the same. A taxable investor may undertake risky investments and hedge their downside risk while a TFSA investor is precluded from doing so. Accordingly, argues the Appellant, the investment strategy of a rational TFSA investor would include the following considerations:\n1. Because income may be withdrawn free of tax from a TFSA trust, a TFSA investor would be inclined to assume more risk \u2014 with the prospect of greater reward \u2014 than a taxable investor.\n2. Because income accrues free of tax within a TFSA trust, a TFSA investor would be more inclined to sell to realize gains earlier and more often than a taxable investor.\n3. Because losses within a TFSA trust are not deductible from other income, a TFSA investor would be more inclined to sell to cut losses earlier and more often than a taxable investor.\n[26] For those reasons, the Appellant argues that a rational TFSA investor would invest in riskier and more speculative securities with greater upside potential and would trade those securities more often than a taxable investor. [22] In light of these investment realities, the traditional test the courts have used to distinguish between gains and losses on income and capital account for securities transactions should not determine whether a TFSA trust is carrying on a business of trading in qualified securities.\n[27] The traditional test fails because two of its most important elements \u2014 the number and frequency of transactions and the speculative nature of the investments \u2014 are stacked against the taxpayer. In addition, several other elements of the traditional test do not apply. For example, a TFSA trust cannot borrow, so that element is inapplicable. A TFSA trust would not advertise, so that element is inapplicable as well.\n[28] The only elements of the traditional test left standing are knowledge of the securities markets, whether investing is part of the holder\u2019s ordinary business, and time spent researching investments. In other words, whether the TFSA investor is experienced, knowledgeable, and well-informed. As the traditional test would make professional investors such as Mr. Ahamed taxable, those investors would never be able to reap the full benefits of investing in a TFSA trust. Discrimination against professional investors could not have been one of Parliament\u2019s purposes.\n[29] To address the deficiencies of the traditional test in this context, the Appellant proposes a new test. The Appellant\u2019s proposed test asks three questions: [23]\n1. Did the TFSA trust\u2019s business occupy the taxpayer\u2019s time, attention, and labour?\n2. Did the TFSA trust incur liabilities in the course of its business?\n3. Was the purpose of the TFSA trust to provide a livelihood to the taxpayer?\n[30] For the Minister to prevail, all three questions must be answered in the affirmative. Admittedly, the TFSA trust occupied Mr. Ahamed\u2019s time, attention, and labour, but TFSA trusts cannot incur liabilities and the purpose of this TFSA trust was not to provide Mr. Ahamed\u2019s livelihood. Accordingly, the Court should find that the TFSA trust did not carry on a business of trading qualified investments during the taxation years in issue.\nD. Obiter from Prochuk\n[31] In this Court\u2019s decision in Prochuk, it was held that the appellant\u2019s losses were on capital account and were, therefore, not deductible in computing income. In that case, the appellant lost $186,250 from investing in a fraudulent scheme. [24] He deducted the loss against his other income as a business loss. [25] He argued that the loss was deductible in computing his income because he was in the business of trading. He pointed to the level of trading activity within his own RRSP as evidence that he carried on such a business outside his RRSP. [26]\n[32] In concluding that the appellant\u2019s loss was on capital account, this Court held that the level of trading activity within an RRSP cannot be considered in determining whether a taxpayer was in the business of trading outside his RRSP. This Court said:\n[48] \u2026the Act treats an individual who trades within his RRSP differently than a taxpayer who is in the business of trading. For this reason, trades within an RRSP are not relevant in deciding whether an individual is in the business of trading. [27]\n[emphasis added]\n[33] The Appellant argues that in Prochuk, this Court noted in obiter an \u201cessential finding\u201d [28] that trading qualified investments cannot constitute the \u201ccarrying on of a business\u201d within an RRSP. In the course of its reasons, this Court made the following observations:\n[49] Counsel for the respondent pointed to the decision of Justice C. Miller of this Court in Deep v. R., 2006 TCC 315, 2006 D.T.C. 3033 (Eng.) (T.C.C. [General Procedure]) in support of the proposition that trading within an RRSP does not amount to business income.\n[50] In Deep, there were a number of questions in issue, including whether Mr. Deep was engaged in the business of trading in stock and financial instruments. With respect to trading within an RRSP, Justice Miller stated as follows at paragraph 51:\n... He provided no evidence of any extensive trading activity during those years, nor do his tax returns reflect any level of activity that would constitute trading as a business. Even his own testimony was the trading he carried on was within his RRSP. This is not the carrying on of a business.\n[51] Accordingly, I am satisfied that trading within an RRSP does not amount to carrying on the business of trading. [29]\n[emphasis added]\n[34] Although the statement at paragraph 51 of Prochuk was made in the RRSP context and was obiter, there is no reason why it should not apply in the TFSA context.\nThe Crown\u2019s Argument\n[35] In interpreting the meaning of a statutory provision, the Court should read the words of the Act in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament. Statutory interpretation reveals Parliament\u2019s legislative intent by examining the text, context and purpose of a statutory provision. [30]\nA. Parliament\u2019s Primary Purpose\n[36] The TFSA was introduced in the February 2008 Budget. The legislative framework for TFSAs is set out in section 146.2 of the Act and applies for 2009 and subsequent taxation years. A TFSA is a general-purpose savings account that allows individuals to contribute each year and withdraw funds at any time for any purpose. Generally, income (including capital gains) earned within a TFSA is not subject to tax and distributions from a TFSA are received tax-free.\n[37] TFSA contributions are not deductible in computing an individual\u2019s income for a taxation year. Paragraph 149(1)(u.2) of the Act provides that the taxable income of a trust governed by a TFSA is exempt from Part I tax to the extent provided by section 146.2. The terms of that tax exemption are specifically set out in subsection 146.2(6) of the Act.\nB. Parliament\u2019s Secondary Purposes\n[38] Subsection 146.2(6) provides that a TFSA trust is exempt from tax on its taxable income for a taxation year, subject to two exceptions. The exemption is lost if, at any time in the taxation year, the trust (a) holds one or more properties that are non-qualified investments or (b) carries on one or more businesses.\n[39] If either or both exceptions apply, tax is payable by the TFSA trust on the amount that would be its taxable income for the taxation year if it had no income or loss from sources other than those properties (i.e., properties that are non\u2011qualified investments) or businesses, and no capital gains or capital losses other than from dispositions of those properties.\n(1) Limiting Investments in a TFSA Trust to \u201cQualified Investments\u201d\n[40] Since a TFSA is liable for tax on any income from non-qualified investments, the rules distinguish between qualified and non-qualified investments. To remain exempt from tax, TFSAs must limit their investments to qualified investments. The definition of a \u201cqualified investment\u201d for a trust governed by a TFSA is set out in subsection 207.01(1) of the Act, which includes an investment that would be described by any of paragraphs (a) to (d), (f) and (g) of the definition of \u201cqualified investment\u201d in section 204. Investments prescribed in section 4900 of the Income Tax Regulations are included in the definition of a \u201cqualified investment\u201d in subsection 207.01(1) of the Act. By virtue of the applicable paragraphs of the definition of a \u201cqualified investment\u201d in section 204 of the Act, the following are qualified investments for a TFSA:\n1. money \u2013 paragraph (a);\n2. certain debt obligations \u2013 paragraphs (b), (c) and (c.1);\n3. certain securities that are listed on a designated stock exchange \u2013 paragraph (d);\n4. certain guaranteed investment certificates \u2013 paragraph (f); and\n5. certain investment contracts \u2013 paragraph (g).\n[41] Subsection 146.2(6) of the Act adopts the definition of \u201cnon-qualified investments\u201d in subsection 207.01(1). Subsection 207.01(1) provides that a \u201cnon\u2011qualified investment\u201d for a trust governed by a TFSA means property that is not a qualified investment for the trust.\n(2) Limiting Investment Activity in a TFSA Trust to Passive Investment\n[42] The Act does not provide a general definition of a \u201cbusiness\u201d but does include specific activities in the extended non-exhaustive definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d in subsection 248(1). In particular, subsection 248(1) extends the meaning of \u201cbusiness\u201d to include a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatever and an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. The traditional common law definition of the term \u201cbusiness\u201d is \u201canything that occupies the time and attention and labour of a man for the purpose of profit\u201d. [31] No single factor is determinative. The quintessential characteristics of business are activity, enterprise, entrepreneurship, commercial risk and the pursuit of profit.\n[43] The verb \u201ccarries on\u201d, in the phrase \u201ccarries on one or more business\u201d in subsection 146.2(6), implies a level of activity. When Parliament passed section 146.2 of the TFSA legislation in 2008, it was already well-established that a taxpayer could carry on business by trading in securities, which would give rise to income from business. The established legal principles applicable to determining whether a taxpayer carries on business by trading in securities that gives rise to business income were entrenched in the jurisprudence by 2008. Indeed, by 1981, the case law was so clear that a taxpayer\u2019s transactions in securities could amount to carrying on business that the Department of National Revenue (the CRA\u2019s predecessor) issued Interpretation Bulletin IT-479R. Interpretation Bulletin IT-479R correctly states that depending on the taxpayer\u2019s entire course of conduct, transactions in securities could amount to carrying on business, any proceeds from which would be taxable on income account. In 1993, the Federal Court of Appeal in Vancouver Art Metal Works Ltd. emphasized that it is a question of fact whether trading securities amounted to carrying on a business and set out certain factors relevant to such a determination. [32] Those factors included the frequency of transactions, the duration of holdings, the intention to acquire for resale at a profit, the nature and quantity of the securities held, or the subject matter of the transaction, and the time spent on the activity.\n[44] Parliament is presumed to know the legal context in which it legislates. [33] But even ignoring the presumption, given the overwhelming jurisprudence, it is inconceivable that Parliament was not aware that trading in securities could amount to the carrying on of a business when it passed the TFSA legislation in 2008.\nC. The Text of Subsection 146.2(6) is Clear and Unambiguous\n[45] Having regard to the well-established meaning of the words used in subsection 146.2(6), a TFSA that carries on business, including the business of trading in qualified investments, is not tax exempt. Apart from the narrow carve\u2011out in section 253.1, the exception has no other conditions, qualifications or carve-outs (leaving aside the computational rules in paragraphs 146.2(6)(a) to (c) of the Act).\n[46] The Appellant\u2019s interpretation would require the Court to read into the text of subsection 146.2(6) further conditions or qualifications to find that the words \u201ccarries on one or more businesses\u201d excludes a TFSA that carries on business by trading qualified investments. This would insert unexpressed exceptions into the provision, contrary to the directions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada Trustco. [34]\n[47] Stated another way, accepting the Appellant\u2019s interpretation would require a judicial redrafting of subsection 146.2(6). But it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that the Court should not accept an interpretation which requires it to add words where there is, as here, another acceptable interpretation that does not require any additional wording. [35] Moreover, a judicial amendment by re\u2011writing the text of subsection 146.2(6) or reading words into the provision would usurp Parliament\u2019s role and disregard Parliament\u2019s intent. [36]\n[48] The text of subsection 146.2(6) does not give rise to more than one reasonable interpretation. The ordinary meaning of the words of subsection 146.2(6) should play a dominant role in the interpretive process as the words are precise and unequivocal. [37] Even where the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the legislative context and purpose must be examined. But this is not a license to overlook the text or extend the meaning of a provision beyond what its words will allow. [38]\nD. A TFSA is Not an RRSP\n[49] The RRSP and RRIF provisions, like the TFSA provisions, are located in Division G of Part I of the Act, titled \u201cDeferred and Other Special Income Arrangements\u201d. In addition to section 146.2, Division G establishes the legislative framework for:\na) registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) in section 146;\nb) registered retirement income plans (RRIFs) in section 146.3;\nc) registered education savings plans (RESPs) in section 146.1;\nd) registered disability savings plans (RDSPs) in section 146.4; and\ne) pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs) in section 147.5 (effective December 14, 2012).\n[50] The RRSP and RRIF rules provide that if an RRSP or RRIF has carried on any business or businesses in a taxation year, the portion of its taxable income that may reasonably be considered to be income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments is exempt from tax. As such, if an RRSP or RRIF engages in business through active or \u201cday trading\u201d of various securities, the RRSP or RRIF would not be taxable on the income derived from that business provided that the trading activities are limited to buying and selling qualified investments.\n[51] Parliament could have adopted, but chose not to adopt, the same statutory approach for TFSAs as it did for RRSPs and RRIFs. This further shows that Parliament did not intend to exempt business income from the disposition of qualified investments held in a TFSA from tax under Part I of the Act. The rules applicable to RRSPs differ somewhat from those applicable to TFSAs. Foremost is that contributions to an RRSP are deductible in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year, subject to an annual RRSP deduction limit. The other key difference is that amounts withdrawn from an RRSP are included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income in the year of receipt.\n[52] Under subsection 146(4) of the Act, and subject to certain exceptions, no tax is payable on the taxable income of a trust if, throughout the period in the year during which the trust was in existence, the trust was governed by an RRSP. Two exceptions, which are concerned with whether the trust has borrowed money or the annuitant of the RRSP has died, are not relevant here. The third exception in paragraph 146(4)(b) is key. Paragraph 146(4)(b) provides that if the RRSP trust has carried on any business or businesses in the year, it will be liable for Part I tax on the difference between:\n(i) the amount that its taxable income for the year would be if it had no income or losses from sources other than from that business or those businesses;\nand (minus)\n(ii) such portion of the amount above for the year as can reasonably be considered to be income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments for the trust.\n[53] The effect of subparagraphs 146(4)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Act is that under the RRSP rules, an RRSP trust must pay tax under Part I on the amount that would be its taxable income for the year from carrying on a business, but excluding any business income that can reasonably be considered to be derived from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments.\n[54] The Appellant seeks judicial approval of an interpretation of subsection 146.2(6) which is applicable to TFSA trusts and that accords with the text of subsection 146(4). But subsection 146(4) of the Act does not apply to TFSA trusts.\n[55] Had Parliament intended to exempt from Part I tax the business income of a TFSA trading in qualified investments, it could have used the legislative framework found in subsection 146(4) of the Act. Parliament did not do so. This deliberate choice confirms the different meaning of subsection 146.2(6) arising from the different text. The use of different expressions in subsections 146.2(6) and 146(4) necessarily means that Parliament did not intend for the two expressions to be synonymous. There is no logical basis for giving the same meaning to the different words in subsections 146.2(6) and 146(4).\n[56] The reason for Parliament\u2019s more permissive treatment of RRSPs is readily apparent; funds withdrawn from an RRSP are taxable as ordinary income. Thus, an RRSP provides only a deferral of tax. In contrast, funds withdrawn from a TFSA are permanently exempt from tax, unless the exception in subsection 146.2(6) applies. Moreover, the basis for the contextual distinction between the rules governing these different types of registered plans is made even more apparent by the legislative history of RRSPs. The RRSP rules did not always exempt the business income of an RRSP from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments, from Part I tax. From 1972 to 1993, the RRSP framework included an exception that was nearly identical to the TFSA exception at issue.\n[57] In February 1993, the Minister of Finance released draft legislation and explanatory notes in respect of proposed changes to the RRSP rules. The proposed changes included an amendment to revise paragraph 146(4)(b) to its present form. [39] The explanatory notes stated:\nSubsection 146(4) of the Income Tax Act generally provides that no tax is payable by trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) except in specified circumstances. Subsection 146.3(3) is a similar provision for trusts governed by registered retirement income funds (RRIFs). This exemption does not, however, extend to income from the carrying on of a business.\nParagraphs 146(4)(b) and 146.3(3)(e) are amended so that this exemption extends to business income from, or from the disposition of, a qualified investment for RRSPs and RRIFs. The amendments recognize that business income may be allocated to units in limited partnerships that are held by RRSPs and RRIFs. The amendments also recognize that the disposition of qualified investments by RRSPs and RRIFs may, in some circumstances, result in business income. \u2026 [40]\n[58] Following a change of government, the draft legislation was reintroduced and paragraph 146(4)(b) was amended. The explanatory notes released in May 1994 reflect the same purpose for the amendment. The legislative history of paragraph 146(4)(b) demonstrates that Parliament has carefully and deliberately chosen to exempt from Part I tax the income of an RRSP trust that carries on business, to the extent that the business income may reasonably be considered to be income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments.\n[59] Had Parliament also intended to exempt from tax a TFSA\u2019s income from carrying on a particular type of business \u2014 trading qualified investments \u2014 Parliament would have legislated accordingly, just as it had for RRSPs. The structural differences between the RRSP and TFSA rules show that income of an RRSP trust earned from carrying on a business of trading qualified investments will eventually be taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn from the RRSP. But because withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxed, income of the same nature would permanently escape taxation without the exception in subsection 146.2(6).\n[60] A contextual analysis of subsection 146(4) and the provisions applicable to RRSPs support the conclusion that Parliament intentionally chose not to exempt income of a TFSA from tax if the TFSA carries on a business of trading qualified investments. TFSAs have a cost to the fisc in the form of foregone tax revenues. Parliament had to enact rules to protect the integrity of the tax system by limiting the tax exemptions for TFSAs through restrictions in subsection 146.2(6) and other anti-avoidance rules.\n[61] The TFSA scheme was uniquely designed to allow Canadians to increase their savings by earning tax-free investment income [41] such as capital gains, interest and dividends, and not to enable the carrying on of business tax-free. As such, the Appellant\u2019s argument is not supported by a purposive interpretation of subsection 146.2(6). The TFSA regime was introduced in the February 2008 Budget to \u201creduce the taxation of savings\u201d and incentivize savings, not to incentivize the carrying on of businesses trading qualified investments.\n[62] The 2008 Budget Supplementary Information states that TFSAs were proposed as a flexible registered savings account that would help Canadians with their different savings needs over their lifetime. The tax assistance provided by a TFSA was described as, in many ways, the mirror (i.e., reverse) image of that provided through RRSPs:\na) RRSP contributions are tax deductible, with both contributions and the investment earnings taxable upon withdrawal; and\nb) TFSA contributions are made from after-tax income, with both the contributions and the investment earnings exempt from Part I tax upon withdrawal.\n[63] Commentary released by the Department of Finance in respect of the 2008 Budget recognized that the TFSA would allow Canadian resident individuals to earn investment income, including interest, dividends and capital gains, on a tax\u2011free basis. Parliament did not legislate the exceptions to the tax exemption in subsection 146.2(6) for no reason. When considered in light of the overall structure of the TFSA rules, the purpose of the exception in subsection 146.2(6) \u2014 which makes income from the carrying on of one or more businesses by a TFSA taxable \u2014 is to ensure that the tax exemption is restricted to the passive holding of qualified investments.\nE. Obiter from Prochuk\n[64] Prochuk does not support the Appellant\u2019s interpretation of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act. The issue in Prochuk was whether Mr. Prochuk was entitled to claim a business loss for the 2007 taxation year in respect of a failed investment in a foreign exchange currency fund. The Crown argued that Mr. Prochuk was not entitled to claim a business loss because he was not in the business of trading, and the investment was not an adventure in the nature of trade. Mr. Prochuk testified that, starting in 2000, he made his livelihood from gains made in his RRSP. He argued that he spent his life trading and since 2000 had run a business within his RRSP, with significant gains, showing that he was an active trader, all in support of the position that he was in the business of trading and should be allowed to deduct trading losses incurred outside his RRSP.\n[65] This Court acknowledged that it was a question of fact whether Mr. Prochuk was a trader and, after considering the factors in Vancouver Art Metal Works, concluded that he was not a trader. The Court also concluded that trades within an RRSP are not relevant in deciding whether an individual (rather than the RRSP trust) is in the business of trading. In reaching this conclusion, this Court made an obiter statement that trading within an RRSP does not amount to carrying on the business of trading. To the extent that this statement is read as support for the Court\u2019s conclusion that trading within an RRSP trust does not amount to carrying on the business of trading outside the RRSP, the Crown takes no issue. But if this Court meant to say in Prochuk that trading within an RRSP cannot amount to the carrying on of business by the RRSP trust, the statement, respectfully, is per incuriam. There is no indication that the Court considered paragraph 146(4)(b) \u2014 which expressly contemplates an RRSP trust carrying on business trading in qualified investments \u2014 and the Crown did not bring that provision to the Court\u2019s attention.\nTextual, Contextual, and Purposive Analysis\nA. Text\n[66] We begin with the relevant text from subsection 146.2(6) of the Act:\n146.2(6) No tax is payable under this Part by a trust that is governed by a TFSA on its taxable income for a taxation year, except that, if at any time in the taxation year, it carries on one or more businesses ... tax is payable under this Part by the trust ...\n[emphasis added]\n146.2(6) Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie par une fiducie r\u00e9gie par un compte d\u2019\u00e9pargne libre d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur son revenu imposable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Toutefois, si, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, la fiducie exploite une ou plusieurs entreprises ... l'imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu par la pr\u00e9sente partie est \u00e0 payer par la fiducie \u2026\n[nous soulignons]\n[67] The words \u201ccarries on one or more businesses\u201d are broad enough to capture all businesses, including a business of trading qualified investments. Before considering context and purpose, it is important to reflect on the centrality of statutory language in interpreting the text. In a recent essay, Pooja Mihailovich notes that the Supreme Court of Canada consistently emphasizes the primacy of text. She observes that:\n. . . in considering the relative weight to be afforded to text, context, and purpose in the tax context, the court has emphasized the primacy of text. For instance, in Alta Energy, a majority of the Supreme Court clarified that where tax provisions are drafted with \u201cparticularity and detail,\u201d a largely textual interpretation is appropriate. Similarly, in Loblaw Financial, the court unanimously held that in applying the unified approach, courts should focus carefully on the text and context in assessing the purpose of the relevant statutory scheme, especially if it is detailed and the provisions in issue are otherwise precise and unequivocal. [42]\nB. Context\n[68] Context includes both internal and external context. Internal context includes (a) the words in the context of the provision in which they are situated and (b) the provision in the context of the Act in which it is situated. [43]\n[69] Subsection 146.2(6) forms part of Division G of Part I of the Act. Division G, as it stood in early 2009 included 13 sections:\nDIVISION G - Deferred and Other Special Income Arrangements\n144 Employees Profit Sharing Plans\n145 Registered Supplementary Unemployment Benefit Plans\n146 Registered Retirement Savings Plans\n146.01 Home Buyers\u2019 Plan\n146.02 Lifelong Learning Plan\n146.1 Registered Education Savings Plans\n146.2 Tax-free Savings Accounts\n146.3 Registered Retirement Income Funds\n146.4 Registered Disability Savings Plan\n147 Deferred Profit Sharing Plans\n147.1 Registered Pension Plans\n148 Life Insurance Policies\n148.1 Eligible Funeral Arrangements\n[70] Each of these sections constitutes a separate statutory scheme. Each has its own definition section and its own set of detailed provisions reflecting its legislative purposes. Absent statutory direction to the contrary, their components are not interchangeable.\n[71] The RRSP regime set out in section 146 is a statutory scheme separate from the TFSA trust regime set out in section 146.2. This is apparent from the differences between the two schemes:\n1. There is no minimum age to contribute to an RRSP [44] while an individual must be 18 or older to contribute to a TFSA. [45]\n2. One\u2019s last opportunity to contribute to their RRSP is the end of the year in which they turn 71 [46] while there is no maximum age to contribute to a TFSA. [47]\n3. Contributions to an RRSP are fixed in accordance with an individual\u2019s \u201cearned income\u201d for the previous year up to the RRSP dollar limit (18% of earned income in the previous year to a maximum of $30,780 for 2023) [48] while contributions to a TFSA are fixed at the same inflation-adjusted dollar amount for everyone ($6,500 for 2023) [49] regardless of whether they had any earned income in the previous year. [50]\n4. The deadline to contribute to an RRSP in respect of the previous year is the first 60 days of the following year [51] while there is no contribution deadline for a TFSA. Rather, individuals can contribute to their TFSA at any time, as long as they have unused TFSA contribution room. Additional contribution room for a TFSA accrues on January 1 each year. [52]\n5. Contributions to an RRSP are deductible in computing income (subject to an annual deduction limit) [53] while contributions to a TFSA are not. [54]\n6. The holder of an RRSP may benefit by contributing to their spouse\u2019s RRSP [55] while there is no provision allowing a TFSA holder to contribute to their spouse\u2019s TFSA. [56]\n7. Income within an RRSP accrues on a tax-deferred basis [57] while income within a TFSA accrues on a tax-free basis. [58]\n8. There is no provision allowing withdrawals from an RRSP to be re\u2011contributed [59] while withdrawals from a TFSA may be re\u2011contributed the following year. [60]\n9. Withdrawals from an RRSP are taxable in the year of withdrawal [61] while withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxable at all. [62]\n10. Withdrawals from an RRSP may affect the holder\u2019s entitlement to federal income-tested benefits and tax credits [63] while withdrawals from a TFSA do not. [64]\n[72] As to external context, subsection 146.2(6) incorporates by reference the well-established judicial test for \u201ccarrying on business\u201d. The nature of that test would have been abundantly clear when Parliament passed subsection 146.2(6) of the Act in 2008 and included it as part of the TFSA regime. [65]\nC. Purpose\n[73] We begin the purposive analysis by ascertaining the primary purpose of the TFSA legislation. In Louie, this Court noted that the TFSA was designed to encourage Canadians to save and invest:\n[32] The general purpose of tax-free savings accounts is to encourage households to invest. In the 2008 budget introducing the tax-free savings accounts, the Department of Finance explained the tax savings that could be realized supposing a 5.5% rate of return on investments generating diversified income (40% interest, 30% dividends and 30% capital gains). The plan was that tax-free savings accounts would improve incentives for people with low and modest incomes to save \u2026 [66]\n[74] In dismissing the taxpayer\u2019s appeal and allowing the Crown\u2019s cross-appeal in Louie, the Federal Court of Appeal restated the purpose of the TFSA:\n[1] Tax Free Savings Accounts were designed to allow Canadians to increase their savings by earning tax-free investment income. While contributions to a TFSA are not tax-deductible, gains earned within a TFSA are generally not taxed. There are exceptions to this general principle. [67]\n[75] Finally, in Hunt, this Court reiterated that the purpose of the TFSA regime is to encourage savings:\n[59] The TFSA regime is a benefit-conferring structure introduced to encourage personal savings by taxpayers by exempting tax from the income otherwise earned on savings. \u2026 [68]\n[76] How did Parliament intend to achieve this primary purpose? To answer that question, we must consider the limits that Parliament chose in order to achieve its overall objective in a fiscally responsible way. [69] As Professor Sullivan notes, the \u201clegislature never pursues a goal single-mindedly, without qualification, and at all costs. There are always additional or competing factors to be taken into account.\u201d [70] As Martin J. stated for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Rafilovich:\n[29] I accept that Parliament had several objectives in mind when it enacted this comprehensive proceeds of crime regime: what Professor Sullivan refers to as \u201cthe desired mix of goals\u201d (Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at p. 409).\n[30] When interpreting a complex scheme such as this one, it is necessary to avoid fixating on one objective to the exclusion of others. As Professor Sullivan explains, secondary purposes must be given an active role in the statutory interpretation analysis:\nWhile legislation may be enacted to promote a primary policy or principle, the primary goals of legislation are almost never pursued single-mindedly or whole-heartedly; various secondary principles and policies are inevitably included in a way that qualifies or modifies the pursuit of the primary goals. Observing the principles of fairness or natural justice, for example, may preclude adopting the most efficient and cost-effective means of pursuing a policy like national security . . . .\nSecondary purposes are not often mentioned in the preamble to legislation or in formal purpose statements. It is through analysis of the legislative scheme, and more particularly through analysis of the relation of each provision to the others in the Act, that these secondary purposes are revealed. [Footnotes omitted in original; p 271.] [71]\n[77] In Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v United Steelworkers, Cromwell J. cautioned that primary legislative purposes, however important, \u201care not pursued at all costs and are clearly intended to be balanced with other important interests within the context of a carefully calibrated scheme\u201d. [72]\n[78] As we have already seen, Parliament\u2019s primary purpose for creating the TFSA was to encourage savings. Its secondary purposes were to achieve that objective within certain limits, including a limit on the type of income that could accumulate tax-free within a TFSA. Whatever one may think of the merits of the policy behind such a limitation, Parliament has described that limitation in the words of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act.\n[79] In subsection 146.2(6) of the Act, Parliament provided that income from a TFSA trust carrying on one or more businesses will be taxable under Part I of the Act. So long as the business is one that may be \u201ccarried on\u201d (i.e., not an \u201cadventure in the nature of trade\u201d) [73] all businesses \u2014 without statutory exception \u2014 fall within the scope of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act, including a business of trading qualified investments.\n[80] Had one of Parliament\u2019s purposes been to extend the scope of the tax exemption to TFSA trusts carrying on a business of trading qualified investments, Parliament would have said so. It had already done so in the context of a different statutory scheme when it amended the RRSP legislation in 1993 to make such an exception for RRSPs. Parliament simply chose not to provide such an exception for TFSAs. [74]\nD. Applying Subsection 146.2(6) to the Agreed Facts\n[81] Applying the law to the facts, the Appellant\u2019s income from carrying on a business of trading qualified investments is subject to tax under subsection 146.2(6) for each of the taxation years reassessed by the Minister. As directed by Mr. Ahamed, the Appellant traded frequently, had an extensive history of buying and selling shares that were mostly speculative in nature, and owned the shares for short periods. In light of Mr. Ahamed\u2019s knowledge and experience in the securities market as a professional investment advisor, and the considerable time he spent researching securities markets, there can be no doubt that the Appellant carried on a business of trading qualified investments for each of the taxation years at issue.\nRuling on the \u201cPook Letter\u201d\n[82] Before the hearing began, the Appellant made a motion asking me to consider a letter from one federal government department to another as an \u201cextrinsic aid\u201d in interpreting subsection 146.2(6) of the Act. [75] The Crown opposed the Appellant\u2019s motion. I heard submissions from both parties and ruled that I would not consider what the Appellant called the \u201cPook Letter\u201d as an extrinsic aid. I promised to give my reasons later. I do so now.\n[83] By way of background, the Pook Letter is a copy of a letter sent in 1969 from David R. Pook, Director of the Policy and Legislation Division at Revenue Canada (predecessor to the Canada Revenue Agency) to J.R. Brown, Senior Tax Adviser at the Department of Finance, expressing certain concerns of Revenue Canada with respect to the RRSP regime as it stood at the time. The letter was sent on the eve of tax reform.\n[84] One of the changes made to the RRSP regime in 1972 as part of tax reform was a limitation on RRSPs carrying on a business. If they did so, the income from such a business would be taxable.\n[85] Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that I should consider the Pook Letter an \u201cextrinsic aid\u201d in interpreting the text of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act. Counsel submitted that it was the Pook Letter that caused the Department of Finance to propose, and Parliament to pass, legislation in the early 1970s making the income of an RRSP from carrying on a business taxable. In particular, counsel for the Appellant relies on excerpts from the Pook Letter reflecting Revenue Canada\u2019s concern that some RRSPs were carrying on business in competition with taxable entities. Counsel contends, based on the Pook Letter, that preventing unfair competition was Parliament\u2019s only purpose in passing the legislation taxing RRSPs that carried on business.\n[86] Appellant\u2019s counsel argued, based on the Pook Letter, that because preventing unfair competition was Parliament\u2019s only purpose in the early 1970s for taxing RRSPs that carried on business, preventing unfair competition must have been Parliament\u2019s sole purpose in passing the 2008 TFSA legislation taxing TFSAs that carried on business.\n[87] Accordingly, says the Appellant, as a TFSA trust that carries on business trading qualified investments does not compete with anyone, the limitation in subsection 146.2(6) of the Act should only apply to businesses that compete unfairly with other businesses, namely, any business other than a business of trading in qualified investments.\n[88] I ruled against the Appellant on the motion as its submissions reflected an unduly narrow view of Parliamentary purposes in passing a carefully calibrated statutory scheme such as the TFSA regime. Rather than taking into account a range of purposes, as the law requires, the Appellant invited me to find that the Pook Letter tells us everything we need to know about Parliament\u2019s purpose in passing subsection 146.2(6) of the Act.\n[89] The Appellant\u2019s submissions on this point are incorrect in law because an unexpressed policy (i.e., preventing unfair competition) cannot override clear legislative text. [76] A purported statutory purpose gleaned from interdepartmental correspondence in the context of one statutory scheme cannot override the clear words of a provision passed by Parliament some 40 years later in the context of another statutory scheme. As Pooja Mihailovich points out, statutory purpose \u201cis inferred from text and is not a freestanding licence to override text\u201d. [77] She correctly observes that:\n. . . in the context of conducting statutory interpretation, the purpose of a provision is determined according to what the legislature concluded the purpose was and by the words the legislature used to represent that conclusion, not what a court divines the purpose to be. [78]\n***\n. . . the text of a provision is almost always the best evidence of its purpose. It is certainly more reliable than unexpressed intentions or abstract, tangential purposes that must be discerned by an uncharted exploration into legislative history and other extrinsic aids, with no rules guiding the proper use of such material. [79]\n[90] The text of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act tells us that any business carried on by a TFSA renders the TFSA\u2019s income from that source taxable. There is no basis within the text of that provision, or elsewhere in the Act, to restrict the scope of the words \u201ccarries on one or more businesses\u201d in subsection 146.2(6) to businesses that compete unfairly with other businesses.\nConclusion\n[91] In 2008, Parliament chose to adopt a legislative scheme for TFSA trusts that was less permissive than the legislative scheme it chose when it amended the RRSP regime in 1993. The Appellant asks the Court to interpret the words used by Parliament in the TFSA provisions as though they were the same words used by Parliament in amending the RRSP regime in 1993.\n[92] This Court has no power to redraft Parliament\u2019s TFSA legislation to incorporate (a) policies inferred from interdepartmental correspondence relating to a different statutory scheme, (b) policies transplanted from a different statutory scheme, or (c) obiter dicta found in reasons for judgment dealing with a different statutory scheme (i.e., Prochuk).\n[93] The appeals for the Appellant\u2019s 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 taxation years are dismissed, with costs. If the parties cannot agree on costs, the Respondent may file written submissions not exceeding ten pages on or before April 11, 2023, the Appellant may file written submissions not exceeding ten pages on or before May 12, 2023, and the Respondent may file written submissions in response not exceeding five pages on or before May 31, 2023.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of February 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

Withdrawals from an RRSP may also affect an individual\u2019s Canada Workers Benefit (see subsections 142(8) and 122.7(1) \u201cadjusted income\u201d and 122.7(2) of the Act).\n[64] Withdrawals from a TFSA are not included in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for the year, and thus do not affect income-tested benefits.\n[65] By the time the TFSA regime was passed by Parliament, the test for \u201ccarrying on business\u201d was deeply entrenched in Canadian tax law not only in the context of the \u201ccapital versus income\u201d issue but in the partnership and non-resident contexts as well. In Canadian tax law, a partnership is a relationship that subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit (see Continental Bank of Canada v R, [1998] 2 SCR 298, 163 DLR (4th) 385; Backman v Canada, 2001 SCC 10; and Spire Freezers Ltd. v Canada, 2001 SCC 11). For an early discussion of how the \u201ccarrying on business\u201d test applied to non-residents of Canada, see H H Stikeman, \u201cCarrying on Business in Canada in Dominion Income Tax Law\u201d (1942) 20:2 Can Bar Rev 77. The \u201ccarrying on business\u201d test is reflected in Canada\u2019s tax treaties which all include a provision along the lines of Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. That article begins by providing that \u201cProfits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein.\u201d See OECD (2019), Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2017 (Full Version), OECD Publishing, Paris. Contrary to the Appellant\u2019s submission, this Court cannot \u2013 and need not \u2013 create an entirely new \u201ccarrying on business\u201d test strictly for purposes of subsection 146.2(6) of the Act.\n[66] Louie v The Queen, 2018 TCC 225 at para 32; rev\u2019d in part Louie FCA, supra note 37\n.\n[67] Louie FCA, supra note 37\nat para 1.\n[68] Hunt v The Queen, 2022 TCC 67 at para 59, under appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal (A-140-22).\n[69] See Ruth Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation, 3rd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2016) at 186-187, where the author observes that the legislature expresses its \u201csecondary purposes\u201d by \u201cwords of restriction, qualification, or exception that limit the reach or effectiveness of the main goals.\u201d [Sullivan].\n[70] Sullivan at 186, as quoted in Mihailovich at 20.\n[71] R v Rafilovich, 2019 SCC 51 at paras 29-30.\n[72] Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v United Steelworkers, 2013 SCC 6 at para 174.\n[73] Tara Exploration and Development Co. v MNR, 70 DTC 6370 (Ex Ct) at para 22, [1970] CTC 557; aff\u2019d on different grounds [1974] SCR 1057.\n[74] Before the 1994 amendments, paragraph 146(4)(b) of the Act read:\n146(4) Except as provided in subsection (10.1), no tax is payable under this Part by a trust on the taxable income of the trust for a taxation year if, throughout the period in the year during which the trust was in existence, the trust was governed by a registered retirement savings plan, except that\n***\n(b) in any case not described in paragraph (a), if the trust has carried on any business or businesses in the year, tax is payable under this Part by the trust on the amount that its taxable income for the year would be if it had no income or losses from sources other than from that business or those businesses; \u2026\nAfter the 1993 amendments, the provision read:\n146(4) Except as provided in subsection (10.1), no tax is payable under this Part by a trust on the taxable income of the trust for a taxation year if, throughout the period in the year during which the trust was in existence, the trust was governed by a registered retirement savings plan, except that\n***\n(b) in any case not described in paragraph (a), if the trust has carried on any business or businesses in the year, tax is payable under this Part by the trust on the amount, if any, by which\n(i) the amount that its taxable income for the year would be if it had no incomes or losses from sources other than from that business or those businesses, as the case may be,\nexceeds\n(ii) such portion of the amount determined under subparagraph 146(i) in respect of the trust for the year as can reasonably be considered to be income from, or from the disposition of, qualified investments for the trust; \u2026\n[75] The Appellant\u2019s Motion Record was marked for identification as M-1.

It was ultimately completed virtually over a 5-month intermittent period. I commend both parties and their counsel for their flexibility and willingness to adapt to the changing, unpredictable circumstances during this period.\nIssues\n[4] The issues are as follows:\na) Were the appellant\u2019s tractor projects scientific research & experimental development (SR&ED) in 2005 and specifically, did the appellant\u2019s activities constitute experimental development?\nb) If so, then what amount are qualified expenses under clause 37(8)(a)(ii)(B) (i.e. the proxy method)?\n[5] The Minister says that the appellant\u2019s activities did not meet the definition of SR&ED and were more accurately described as routine testing, quality control, and\/or product development.\nLegal framework\n[6] The definition of SR&ED has not changed since before the taxation year under appeal and reads as follows: [1]\n\u201cscientific research and experimental development\u201d means systematic investigation or search that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis and that is\n(a) basic research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge without a specific practical application in view,\n(b) applied research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view, or\n(c) experimental development, namely, work undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including incremental improvements thereto,\nand, in applying this definition in respect of a taxpayer, includes\n(d) work undertaken by or on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to engineering, design, operations research, mathematical analysis, computer programming, data collection, testing or psychological research, where the work is commensurate with the needs, and directly in support, of work described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) that is undertaken in Canada by or on behalf of the taxpayer,\nbut does not include work with respect to\n(e) market research or sales promotion,\n(f) quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes,\n(g) research in the social sciences or the humanities,\n(h) prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas,\n(i) the commercial production of a new or improved material, device or product or the commercial use of a new or improved process,\n(j) style changes, or\n(k) routine data collection.\n[7] With respect to the deduction of SR&ED expenditures, the relevant portion of paragraph 37(1)(a) read as follows in 2005:\n37. (1) Scientific research and experimental development [in Canada] \u2013 Where a taxpayer carried on a business in Canada in a taxation year, there may be deducted in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income from the business for the year such amount as the taxpayer claims not exceeding the amount, if any, by which the total of\n(a) the total of all amounts each of which is an expenditure of a current nature made by the taxpayer in the year or in a preceding taxation year ending after 1973\n(i) on scientific research and experimental development carried on in Canada, directly undertaken by or on behalf of the taxpayer, and related to a business of the taxpayer, ...\n[8] When calculating SR&ED expenditures using the proxy method under clause 37(8)(a)(ii)(B) as it read in 2005, expenses on or in respect of SR&ED include only those incurred by the taxpayer in the year each of which is:\n(I) an expenditure of a current nature for, and all or substantially all of which was attributable to, the lease of premises, facilities or equipment for the prosecution of scientific research and experimental development in Canada, other than an expenditure in respect of general purpose office equipment or furniture,\n(II) an expenditure in respect of the prosecution of scientific research and experimental development in Canada directly undertaken on behalf of the taxpayer,\n(III) an expenditure described in subclause (A)(III), other than an expenditure in respect of general purpose office equipment or furniture,\n(IV) that portion of an expenditure made in respect of an expense incurred in the year for salary or wages of an employee who is directly engaged in scientific research and experimental development in Canada that can reasonably be considered to relate to such work having regard to the time spent by the employee thereon, and, for this purpose where that portion is all or substantially all of the expenditure, that portion shall be deemed to be the amount of the expenditure,\n(V) the cost of materials consumed in the prosecution of scientific research and experimental development in Canada, or\n(VI) \u00bd of any other expenditure of a current nature in respect of the lease of premises, facilities or equipment used primarily for the prosecution of scientific research and experimental development in Canada, other than an expenditure in respect of general purpose office equipment or furniture.\n[9] For the purposes of subclause 37(8)(a)(ii)(B)(III) above, subclause (A)(III) describes the following type of expenditure (as it read in 2005):\n(III) an expenditure of a capital nature that at the time it was incurred was for the provision of premises, facilities or equipment, where at that time it was intended\nthat it would be used during all or substantially all of its operating time in its expected useful life for, or\nthat all or substantially all of its value would be consumed in,\nthe prosecution of scientific research and experimental development in Canada, ...\n[10] The criteria first set out in Northwest Hydraulic Consultants Ltd. [2] continue to be used when determining whether a set of activities fits within the definition of SR&ED. The Federal Court of Appeal has endorsed this approach on numerous occasions [3] and summarized the criteria as follows: [4]\na) Was there a technological risk or uncertainty which could not be removed by routine engineering or standard procedures?\nb) Did the person claiming to be doing SR&ED formulate hypotheses specifically aimed at reducing or eliminating that technological uncertainty?\nc) Did the procedure adopted accord with the total discipline of the scientific method including the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses?\nd) Did the process result in a technological advancement?\ne) Was a detailed record of the hypotheses tested, and results kept as the work progressed?\nWitnesses\n[11] The following witnesses testified:\na) Willy Janzen \u2013 joined Buhler Industries Inc. in 2006 as corporate controller and became its chief financial officer;\nb) Dr. Donald Himbeault \u2013 senior manager of R&D Tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers since 2012.

Research & technology advisor for CRA since 2016, with no prior involvement on the appellant\u2019s file. Professional engineer since 2015 with a bachelor of engineering (mechanical) and master of science in mechanical engineering and industrial management.\nFactual background\nThe appellant\n[12] The appellant is based in Winnipeg and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buhler Industries Inc., which is a publicly traded company. [5] Buhler Industries Inc. purchased agricultural tractor manufacturer Versatile in 2000, resulting in the appellant. Versatile mass-produced the first 4-wheel drive articulated tractor in 1966 [6] and the appellant is currently the only agricultural tractor manufacturer in Canada. [7]\n[13] Mr. Janzen testified that the appellant exports approximately 60 percent of its tractors internationally. [8] As a tractor manufacturer, it competes with much larger companies such as John Deere and Case New Holland. [9] He stated that even though its competitors were significantly bigger, the appellant inherited the Versatile ideology to value innovation. [10]\n[14] He stated that the appellant\u2019s manufacturing plant is 684,000 square feet in size and includes a testing chamber within which there is a rocks tester and a machine for testing the rollover protection system (ROPS). He testified that the appellant also has an 80-acre test track which includes a 500-foot bump track (with bumps of varying severity). [11]\nThe projects\n[15] The appellant\u2019s fiscal year-end is September 30th and its 2005 SR&ED claim consisted of seven projects: [12]\nProject number\nName\nStart date\nFinish date\n(Actual or expected)\n1\nFWD RTT \u2013 Four Wheel Drive Rubber Track Phase E\nJanuary 2002\nSeptember 2009\n2\n4WD Phase C Tier II\nSeptember 1999\nSeptember 2005\n3\nGenesis Upgrade Phase A Tier II\nJanuary 2003\nSeptember 2005\n4\nGenesis Upgrade Phase G Tier III High HP\nSeptember 2001\nApril 2007\n5\n4WD Phase D Tier II High HP\nJanuary 2002\nOctober 2006\n6\n4WD Phase C-2 Tier III\nOctober 2004\nDecember 2007\n7\nPhase \u201cJ\u201d Plus 600 HP 4WD Tractors\nOctober 2004\nOctober 2008\n[16] With respect to the abbreviations and terminology used to describe the seven projects:\n(a) \u201c4WD\u201d and \u201cFWD\u201d mean four-wheel drive;\n(b) \u201cRTT\u201d means rubber track tractor (i.e. as opposed to rubber tires); [13]\n(c) \u201cHP\u201d means horsepower;\n(d) \u201cPhase\u201d appears to refer to testing or development phases;\n(e) \u201cTier\u201d refers to emission standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Tier II standards being older and lower than Tier III; [14] and\n(f) \u201cGenesis\u201d refers to a specific line of tractors, with 4WD being another tractor line.\n[17] The bulk of the appellant\u2019s SR&ED claim is associated with project 5 (4WD Phase D Tier II High HP). During the hearing, both parties focused their respective presentations on this project.\nProject 5: 4WD Phase D Tier II High Horsepower Tractor\n[18] The appellant\u2019s goal in this project was to create a line of high-horsepower 4WD tractors which met Tier II emission standards and were suitable for agricultural and commercial construction (e.g. scraping\/earth-moving\/levelling) applications. [15] Within this line, they sought to build a 4WD tractor with over 500 horsepower, which would be above industry levels at the time. [16] Mr. Janzen explained that more powerful agricultural tractors were needed as farms and farm implements had increased in size while the number of farm employees decreased. [17]\n[19] Mr. Minaker testified that the appellant\u2019s larger competitors were also building four-wheel-drive tractors at the time. [18] He recalled that there may have been 450-HP 4WD tractors on the market but no one had yet built one with a horsepower of 500 or greater. [19] The appellant did not know what its competitors might be working on or have access to their research and development, even if it was similar to the appellant\u2019s own. [20]\n[20] The project began in 2002 and by the end of the 2004 fiscal year, the appellant had built three prototypes. [21] During the 2005 fiscal year, three pilots were built with 435, 485, and 535 horsepower respectively. [22] Building the pilots meant using the appellant\u2019s production line facilities to build tractors with near-production line specifications, which tested both the manufacturing readiness of the design and the effectiveness of the manufacturing process. [23]\n[21] At the time of this project, the appellant\u2019s largest 4WD tractor had 425 horsepower and used a Cummins N-14 engine. More stringent (i.e. Tier II) emission requirements were coming and the N-14 engine was being phased out as a result. [24] For this project, the appellant decided to build its line around the Cummins QSX-15 engine, which was Tier-II compliant. [25] Mr. Minaker stated that they would be starting from scratch because the existing 425-HP tractor design had already exceeded its design limits by 25 horsepower and the QSX-15 engine was significantly more powerful. [26]\n[22] Mr. Pell described his role as being one of ensuring that Cummins\u2019 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) installed its engines correctly in order to meet the emissions standard. [27] He also stated that correct installation was important to ensure that the engine survives and does not fail. [28] As part of his role, he gave the appellant feedback on whether its design would meet Cummins\u2019 requirements in order to achieve emissions compliance. [29] In other words, he focused on Cummins\u2019 requirements and left it to the OEM to figure out how to get there. [30] He explained that the conditions in which an engine operates affect its emissions. [31]\n[23] The QSX-15 consisted of a base engine which was a regular on-highway truck engine, but then further developed by Cummins for the off-highway market. [32] In other words, the QSX-15 was intended for off-highway purposes. [33] Mr. Pell explained that having the same base engine meant the major components (e.g. crankshaft, pistons) were the same but the software in the ECM (engine control module) was customized for off-highway use. He stated that the QSX-15 was bespoke for off-highway use but not modified. [34]\n[24] Mr. Pell testified that among other things, the appellant wished for the QSX\u201115 engine to provide an approximate 8% power bulge for this tractor line. He explained that a power bulge is reserve power which enables a tractor to maintain its power even when the tractor meets resistance, i.e. when the engine rpm (rotations per minute) slows because the tractor hits a hard spot in a field, the tractor would ordinarily lose power but for the power bulge. [35] He was unaware of any other tractor manufacturers attempting to install the QSX-15 engine into a tractor or incorporate a power bulge back in 2005. [36]\n(a) Torsional coupler\n[25] While field-testing the prototype and pilot tractors in 2005, the appellant encountered a major durability problem involving the torsional coupler, which is located on the back of the engine. [37] The term \u201ctorsional coupler\u201d is interchangeable with \u201ctorsional damper\u201d, [38] while the word \u201ccoupler\u201d is also interchangeable with \u201ccoupling\u201d. The coupler\u2019s description might also be based on the mechanism\/material that provides the dampening effect, e.g. a rubber coupling or a spring coupler.\n[26] Mr. Minaker described the torsional coupler as the connection between the engine and the rest of the powertrain. [39] He explained that the QSX-15 engine ran at 2,100 rpm, which produces pressure pulses and exerts vibrational pressure on the crankshaft (which converts linear movement to rotational movement in an engine). [40] He stated that the transmission (which controls the engine\u2019s power) would itself consist of multiple gears, shafts, and bearings rotating at various speeds. [41]\n[27] He explained that in this system of spinning components, a torsional coupler is needed to isolate and minimize vibration to prevent the vibrations from destroying the system itself. [42] Mr. Lagadyn described the purpose of the torsional coupler as that of forcing the power of the engine to go through it, thus providing its dampening effect to the rest of the drive line. [43]\n[28] The appellant\u2019s 425-HP tractor used a version of the torsional coupler referred to as an LCD rubber coupler; Mr. Minaker described it as essentially a very large rubber ring in a metal shell and fairly commonly used in the tractor industry. [44] To accommodate the larger QSX-15 engine, it was necessary to raise the engine which resulted in a 5-degree operating angle between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shaft (which receives power from the engine). [45] The LCD coupling ordinarily required the crankshaft and transmission input shaft to be in-line (i.e. at a 0-degree angle) so the 5-degree operating angle resulted in a whipping motion that greatly reduced the lifespan of the coupling. [46]\n[29] The appellant decided to move away from a rubber coupling and try a spring coupler, i.e. which has no rubber and instead uses a series of springs for dampening. It started with spring couplers made by a company called Torsion Control, testing them both in the field and using a dynamometer (an engine-testing device which measures torque). [47] Mr. Minaker explained that a torsional coupler should last over 5,000 hours but it was failing after less than 100 hours with the QSX-15 engine. [48]\n[30] In the process of determining why the coupler failed, the appellant consulted with Torsion Control who in turn gave feedback and suggestions. Mr. Lagadyn succinctly summarized the appellant\u2019s approach as follows:\nThe appellant created a bench test apparatus. The apparatus, or test bed, featured a flywheel and a driveshaft operating at an angle. The intent of the test was to first fail the coupler and observe the baseline reliability, and then test improved coupler designs to measure the incremental reliability gained, if any. However, during bench testing, the appellant recognized that the testing was not matching the failures seen in the field. The appellant considered that the bench testing was creating steady state loads, whereas in the field the loads would be intermittent spike loads.\nThe appellant also considered the possibility that the coupling might be failing due to axial thrust loads on the coupler. The driveshaft contained a slip joint which would in theory prevent thrust loads. The appellant considered that high torque might be creating enough friction to prevent the slip joint from slipping as intended. The appellant considered the thrust loading could be occurring on the coupler from relative movement between the engine and transmission (due to the engine and transmission shifting on their elastomer mounts).\nThe appellant pursued the measurement of actual in-service loads and movements on the coupler and driveshaft on a full scale loaded tractor. The tractor driveshaft was outfitted with a strain gauge arrangement to measure the torque passing through the coupler and driveshaft. The appellant carried out dedicated testing with the tractor on a test track and collected and analysed data. The appellant observed in detail the nature of the loads and movements affecting the coupler. Notably, the torque spikes were significantly higher than expected at approximately four times rated torque. Based on their new understanding, the appellant and Torsion Control made further design changes in the coupler. The primary design changes were making the coupler larger (larger bearings, larger stub shaft) and eliminating the two-piece design which had a welded joint which was subject to fatigue failure. The end result was a larger, heavier duty, one-piece style spring coupler.\n[31] Mr. Minaker testified that the end design was one piece with 12 sets of springs (up from 9), which was larger and heavier but also more durable and more expensive. [49]\n(b) Cooling\n[32] The larger QSX-15 engine presented the appellant with multiple challenges in terms of keeping it cool, thereby maintaining Tier II emissions compliance. Either a sufficient airflow must be created or a cooling system devised because insufficient cooling in turn negatively affects emissions. [50] Mr. Minaker explained that a tractor typically operates in much dustier conditions than a highway truck. The dust and debris tend to plug the tractor\u2019s cooling system components and make it more difficult to keep the engine cool. [51]\n[33] As explained by Mr. Pell, an engine in a vehicle burns fuel to produce power but heat is produced as a by-product. A fast-moving highway vehicle will generate ground air which circulates through the radiator and a cooling stack, all of which serve to cool the engine and prevent overheating. On the other hand, the maximum speed of a tractor is significantly lower than that of a highway vehicle so its movement does not generate the same natural airflow for cooling. [52]\n[34] The difference between a highway vehicle moving at a slow speed versus an inherently slow-moving tractor is the amount of power being drawn from the engine. Mr. Pell stated that a highway truck driving at a slow speed does not pull a high degree of power from the engine so does not require the cooling; when it drives at a fast speed, it pulls more power and needs cooling. [53] When a highway truck goes uphill while pulling a heavy load, it moves slowly but the engine will get some of its power from ram air (i.e. airflow created by movement). [54] He explained that going uphill is only one part of a highway truck\u2019s duty cycle while a tractor pulls power from the engine continuously over an extended period, thus generating heat. [55]\n[35] The cooling system for the previous (Cummins N-14) engine had a built-in intercooler (also called a \u201ccharge air cooler\u201d) to cool the air entering the turbocharger, which in turn compresses air going into the engine. Mr. Minaker explained that the QSX-15 engine had an external\/separate charge air cooler which was part of a cooling system consisting of the radiator to cool the engine coolant, the charge air cooler to cool the air, an oil cooler for the transmission, an oil cooler for the hydraulic system, a fuel cooler (which was new with the QSX-15), an air\u2011conditioning condenser, and the fan plus its shroud. [56]\n[36] The appellant\u2019s initial challenge was the orientation of the larger cooling system at the front of the tractor. The components were too large to position side\u2011by-side so a layered\/stacking approach was required. However, the layered\/stacking approach had the undesired effect of pre-heating the air as it entered the cooling system. Mr. Minaker stated that the appellant had to find a way to balance the need for maximum cooling with serviceability. [57]\n[37] With respect to serviceability, the components had to be oriented in such a way that they could be cleaned of the debris that regularly collects. For that reason, the appellant arrived at a system in which the first two layers of components were hinged so that one could access the third layer for cleaning. [58]\n[38] For maximum cooling, the appellant was challenged by the need to accommodate the physical size of the components while achieving proper fin\u2011spacing; each component had protrusions called fins to increase their surface area for cooling. [59] Mr. Minaker explained that the tighter the fin-spacing, the better the heat rejection but the worse the airflow, and the appellant only had a limited amount of tractor face area to work with. [60] He testified that it was important to keep the tractor at a reasonable size but they ultimately had to widen it twice in order to house the components. [61]\n[39] The appellant tested the cooling system using the dynamometer (called dyno testing) as well as doing field testing. Mr. Minaker stated that the dyno testing took place in a test cell which was a large enclosed room. The tractor would run at full throttle for 6 to 8 hours at a time and approximately 30 variables such as temperatures, pressures, and flows would be measured to determine how the cooling system was working. [62]\n[40] In particular, the appellant monitored the limiting ambient temperature (LAT), i.e. the maximum ambient temperature at which the cooling system would still function properly. Mr. Minaker stated that Cummins\u2019 maximum threshold was conservative in this regard and particularly challenging in that a functional temperature range would be smaller in the field because of the real-world conditions. [63] For example, the appellant\u2019s tractors had to be able to operate in Arizona and Texas which were hotter locations with large amounts of dust\/sand to clog the cooling system. [64] He stated that as another example, it is common in the field for customers to refrain from operating the engine at full throttle in order to save fuel, which results in more heat being created due to the fan turning more slowly (due to the reduced throttle), reduced airflow, and less cooling. [65]\n[41] Another challenge involving the cooling system involved the charge air cooler itself. Mr. Minaker stated that Cummins had a very tight system specification called the intake manifold temperature differential (IMTD); it required that the air be cooled by at least 63 degrees Fahrenheit while the engine was operating at maximum horsepower. The appellant changed the design of the charge air cooler to create a turbulent airflow which increased cooling but simultaneously reduced the air pressure inside the charge air cooler to an unacceptable level. Conversely, increasing the air pressure inside the charge air cooler led to an unacceptable IMTD. The appellant ultimately increased the face area of the charge air cooler to compensate but in turn had to reduce the size of the oil coolers mounted underneath. [66]\n(c) Additional testing\n[42] The appellant put its tractors through a suite of other tests such as noise levels, steering, rollover protection system (called the cab test), braking, air conditioning, power train, manual transmission, bump track (involving random speed bumps), hydraulic system, and air seeder fans. As discussed above, the appellant also conducted field tests of its tractor by operating it in real-world conditions. Mr. Minaker testified that the appellant would make design adjustments in response to these various tests as well. [67]\n[43] A limited number of these tractors went into production in late 2005. Mr. Janzen testified that at the time, this 4WD tractor was known to have the highest horsepower in the world. [68] He stated that when its product life ended in 2014, the appellant sold the intellectual property associated with it for $2.6M in 2017. [69]\nThe Minister\u2019s technical review\n[44] During the Minister\u2019s SR&ED technical review, Mr. Chrystall noted multiple deficiencies in the records provided by the appellant in support of its claim. For example, the appellant provided copies of engineering change orders (ECOs) which showed that engineering work was done, but he did not find they gave him a sense of how the various engineering activities were organized or how they supported the achievement of a technological advancement. Mr. Chrystall also noted that some of the ECOs dealt with things such as licence plates and the color-coordination of control knobs. [70]\n[45] The appellant also provided copies of test data collected, configuration and functional specifications, as well as copies of emails and excerpts of minutes from various meetings during which the tractors were discussed. [71] Dr. Himbeault testified that he gave CRA a representative sample of those records (which he had in turn received from the appellant), and acknowledged that presenting the emails and excerpts from minutes of meetings as contemporaneous records in support of an SR&ED claim would likely not be received well by CRA. [72]\n[46] On June 3, 2008, Mr. Chrystall informed the appellant of his preliminary conclusion that the appellant\u2019s activities were not SR&ED in nature and sent the appellant a preliminary technical review report detailing his findings. He invited the appellant to provide additional information by July 3, 2008, following which his preliminary report would become his final report if the additional information was unpersuasive. The preliminary report did ultimately become the final report, although it is unclear as to why both were signed and dated June 3, 2008. Some issue was made during the hearing as to whether the appellant provided additional (albeit unsatisfactory) information to Mr. Chrystall or none at all. Regardless of the lack of clarity in terms of the timeline of events, I do not believe that anything turns on it.\n[47] At the hearing, Mr. Lagadyn testified that in his opinion, the appellant\u2019s work with respect to the torsional coupler constituted SR&ED while the remainder was product development and routine engineering. [73]\nExpenditures\n[48] The appellant claimed SRED expenditures totalling $3,546.564, broken down as follows: [74]\nProject number\nName\nLabour\nMaterials\nContracts\n1\nFWD RTT \u2013 Four Wheel Drive Rubber Track Phase E\n$954\n2\n4WD Phase C Tier II\n$55,196\n$32,217\n3\nGenesis Upgrade Phase A Tier II\n$82,992\n$35,793\n4\nGenesis Upgrade Phase G Tier III High HP\n$52,266\n$53,791\n5\n4WD Phase D Tier II High HP\n$953,745\n$1,973,069\n$31,360\n6\n4WD Phase C-2 Tier III\n$46,909\n$222,350\n7\nPhase \u201cJ\u201d Plus 600 HP 4WD Tractors\n$5,922\nTotal\n$1,197,030\n$2,318,174\n$31,360\n[49] The Minister reassessed to disallow $3,591,220, which appears to include related\/consequential SR&ED amounts (referred to as \u201cproxy\u201d and \u201cgovernment assistance\u201d) that are not relevant for the purposes of my determination. [75] In disallowing $3,591,220 as SR&ED expenditures, the Minister allowed the full amount as business expenses. [76]\n[50] While the technical review was ongoing, a CRA financial reviewer commenced his review of the appellant\u2019s expenditures and requested breakdowns and details with respect to the amounts claimed. [77] Mr. Janzen acknowledged that the appellant decided not to provide the additional financial information until\/unless the technical review concluded that the activities were SR&ED. [78] The financial reviewer concluded that none of the claimed expenditures qualified for SR&ED, based on the outcome of the technical review. [79]\n[51] At the hearing, the appellant conceded labour amounts recorded under code number 020513 (\u201c513\u201d), which represented 428.5 hours of work or $10,617 of the claimed labour expenditure. [80] The appellant also conceded the contract expenditure of $31,360 which was an amount paid to Deloitte.\n[52] With respect to the labour expenditures, Mr. Janzen acknowledged that the appellant used the hourly rate of $24.78 for every employee rather than their actual wage\/salary. He stated that he was not involved in creating the records in question but that the appellant should have used the actual amounts paid. [81]\nDiscussion and analysis\n(a) Did appellant\u2019s activities constitute SR&ED?\n[53] To answer this question, one must specifically determine whether the activities constitute experimental development as described in paragraph (c) of the definition of SR&ED, i.e. was the work undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, or products or processes, including incremental improvements thereto? [82]\n[54] In considering paragraph (c) of the definition, Chief Justice Bowman\u2019s comments in Northwest Hydraulic are very helpful: [83]\n[8] The appellant relies particularly on paragraph (c) of that definition. Paragraph (c) in the French version reads:\n(c) le d\u00e9veloppement exp\u00e9rimental, \u00e0 savoir les travaux entrepris dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du progr\u00e8s technologique en vue de la cr\u00e9ation de nouveaux mat\u00e9riaux, dispositifs, produits ou proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ou de l\u2019am\u00e9lioration, m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8re, de ceux qui existent.\n[9] I quote this paragraph simply because the words, \u201cde l\u2019am\u00e9lioration, m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8re, de ceux qui existent\" seem to clarify any ambiguity that may be found in the words \"including incremental improvements thereto\u201d.\n[10] The addition of these words in 1995 applicable to taxation years ending after December 2, 1992 appears to have been in response to a concern that the achievement or attempted achievement of slight improvements was not covered. I should not have thought it was necessary to say so. Most scientific research involves gradual, indeed infinitesimal, progress. Spectacular breakthroughs are rare and make up a very small part of the results of SRED in Canada.\n[11] The tax incentives given for doing SRED are intended to encourage scientific research in Canada (Consoltex Inc. v. The Queen, 97 DTC 724). As such the legislation dealing with such incentives must be given \u201csuch fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects\u201d (Interpretation Act, section 12).\n[55] In applying the five Northwest Hydraulic criteria, I am limiting my analysis and conclusions to project 5 which was the 4WD Phase D Tier II High HP tractor.\n(i) Was there a technological risk or uncertainty which could not be removed by routine engineering or standard procedures?\n[56] Technological uncertainty cannot be removed by routine engineering or standard procedures, and the problem\u2019s resolution is not reasonably predictable. [84] \u201cRoutine engineering\u201d consists of techniques, procedures and data that are generally accessible to competent professionals in the field in question. [85]\n[57] I am of the view that the technological uncertainty in this case fits squarely under the description of a system uncertainty. In other words, the integration of non-trivial combinations of established (well-known) technologies and principles carried a major element of technological uncertainty. [86] When all the individual parts were combined, their individual uncertainties were merged into a system uncertainty and the system uncertainty was the entire tractor. [87] All of the constituent parts needed to function in unison to achieve the appellant\u2019s objective. [88]\n[58] The appellant aimed to build a four-wheel-drive tractor with 535 HP at a time when there were none with over 500 HP and the most powerful one may have had 450 HP. For the appellant, the power increase was 110 HP over its previous model and at least an 85-HP increase over its competition. The QSX-15 engine was bespoke for off-highway use in terms of the software but the major components remained that of a highway engine. It was significantly more powerful and larger than the predecessor N-14 engine, and the increased power and size came with attendant challenges in terms of the heat and sheer force generated by its moving parts. It is logical that with a horsepower increase of this magnitude, the obvious problems might not have had obvious solutions.\n[59] In using this engine to build such a tractor, the appellant also faced the overarching requirement that it must stay within specific Cummins parameters in order to meet the desired Tier II emission requirements. The fact that the appellant had to comply with Cummins\u2019 parameters did not make the project a Cummins project. Based on Mr. Pell\u2019s testimony, Cummins builds engines for the use of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) who in turn build original equipment using their engines. Similarly, the fact that Torsion Control gave feedback and suggestions as to how the appellant might design a sufficiently durable coupler, did not make the project a Torsion Control project. I would say that the makers of the individual components which comprise a tractor likely make their respective components with the expectation that these components will end up as parts of a larger thing over which the component-maker does not have proprietorship.\n[60] In this case, the appellant achieved its goal of building a tractor that for a time, was the most powerful one on the market by at least 85 HP and included a power bulge function which was not known by Mr. Pell to exist in other tractors. While the techniques and testing methods were known, the resolution of this system uncertainty was not reasonably predictable, as can be seen by the number of directions the appellant went in its efforts to resolve the cooling and coupler challenges. The system uncertainty was so unpredictable that the appellant had to build a customized torsional coupler in order to continue with its larger goal of incorporating the QSX-15 engine in the process of building a Tier-II-compliant 535-HP tractor.\n[61] Similar to the court\u2019s comments in Northwest Hydraulic, while it is true that any one of the features of the final design may have been known, it is the innovative combination and alignment of these factors which made this project unique. [89]\n(ii) Did the appellant formulate hypotheses specifically aimed at reducing or eliminating that technological uncertainty?\n[62] Northwest Hydraulic says that there are five stages to this process: [90]\n(a) observation of the subject matter of the problem;\n(b) formulation of a clear objective;\n(c) identification and articulation of the technological uncertainty;\n(d) formulation of an hypothesis or hypotheses designed to reduce or eliminate the uncertainty; and\n(e) methodical and systematic testing of the hypotheses.\n[63] Although a technological uncertainty must be identified at the outset, identifying new technological uncertainties along the way and using the scientific method (including intuition, creativity, and sometimes genius) to uncover, recognize, and resolve them is an integral part of SR&ED. [91]\n[64] The appellant was focused and methodical in the way it uncovered, recognized, and resolved the issues involving cooling and the torsional coupler, as two examples of the larger challenges. It did not always know whether a specific theory would successfully resolve a particular issue but it always knew why it was testing that theory.\n[65] For example, the appellant moved away from rubber couplers to spring-based ones because the rubber was breaking; however, the appellant did not know that the spring couplings would work. The appellant then eventually moved away from a 2-piece welded design to a one-piece design. As another example, the appellant knew that the larger cooling system must be accommodated without knowing how to do so. It systematically formulated and tested theories, resulting in a combination of changes to component orientation, spacing, the design of the charge air cooler, and two increases in the size of the tractor itself, among other things.\n[66] With the technological uncertainty being a system uncertainty (i.e. a merging of individual uncertainties) in this instance, the various hypotheses formulated would logically vary in magnitude and relative importance to the system as a whole. The appellant\u2019s process was systematic and methodical, but also creative. I am of the view that this criterion is satisfied.\n(iii) Did the procedure adopted accord with the total discipline of the scientific method including the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses?\n[67] As stated by the court in Northwest Hydraulic, what may appear routine and obvious afterwards may not have been so at the outset. Routine activity is not distinguished from SR&ED solely by adherence to systematic routines, but the adoption of the entire scientific method (including intuitive creativity) with a view to removing a technological uncertainty through the formulation and testing of innovative and untested hypotheses. [92]\n[68] In the present situation involving a system uncertainty, the appellant formulated and tested hypotheses involving individual uncertainties. For the reasons stated under the second criterion, I am of the view that this criterion is satisfied.\n(iv) Did the process result in a technological advancement?\n[69] The appellant did not know whether its competitors were working on a similar high-HP tractor but it did know that a 535-HP 4WD tractor would significantly exceed what was available on the market. Given the fact that the new tractor was for a time, the most powerful one of its kind available by a significant margin, I am of the view that this criterion is satisfied. It is further evidenced by the fact that the associated intellectual property was sold many years later.\n(v) Was a detailed record of the hypotheses tested, and results kept as the work progressed?\n[70] The appellant kept contemporaneous records sufficiently detailed and thorough such that it could systematically test hypotheses involving individual uncertainties, on its way to resolving the system certainty. These records seemed to largely consist of test results, copies of emails, and excerpts from minutes of meetings. While imperfect and incomplete, they were sufficient for the purposes of the work and on a balance, I am of the view that this criterion is satisfied.\nConclusion with respect to whether the activities were SR&ED\n[71] With respect to project 5 (the 4WD Phase D Tier II High HP tractor), I am satisfied that the appellant\u2019s work in 2005 with respect to the 535-HP tractor was SR&ED qualified work and specifically, experimental development. The appellant\u2019s evidence focused on the 535-HP tractor and no specific evidence was led with respect to the 435-HP and 485-HP models developed as part of this tractor line. The horsepower of the latter two models was less than or relatively close to that of competitors\u2019 models already on the market, so system uncertainty is either less clear or absent. Without specific evidence as to these lower-horsepower models, I am not inclined to find that the work in this regard is SR&ED.\n[72] With respect to the remaining six projects, no evidence was led to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumptions. Therefore, the appellant\u2019s activities in these regards do not qualify as SR&ED.\n(b) What amount is deductible under the proxy method?\n[73] As noted in paragraph 48 of these reasons, the amounts claimed for project 5 in 2005 were as follows:\nLabour $ 953,745\nMaterials $1,973,069\nContracts $ 31,360\n[74] After subtracting the amounts conceded by the appellant, i.e. $10,617 for labour and $31,360 for contracts, the remaining claimed expenditures total $2,916,197. Given that the Minister allowed the appellant\u2019s claimed expenditures as business expense deductions, I am not inclined to consider the Minister\u2019s alternative position that the expenditures were not incurred.\n[75] Subsection 230(1) of the Act requires every taxpayer carrying on business to keep records and books of account such that taxes and deductions can be determined. It is the heart of Canada\u2019s self-assessing tax system.\n[76] The appellant\u2019s recordkeeping was sufficient for the purposes of doing the SR&ED qualified work but insufficient for the purposes of clearly ascertaining the amount of qualified expenditures. It was understandable why Mr. Janzen (who inherited the recordkeeping choices made by his predecessor) might have difficulty gathering the necessary records and why the appellant might weigh the practical cost-benefit of attempting to do so in light of an impending negative technical review from the Minister. On the other hand, that choice now makes it more challenging to determine the qualified expenditures. Still on another hand, the appellant performed SR&ED qualified work with respect to the 535-HP tractor and my finding in that regard implies that the Minister should have found so as well.\n[77] The 535-HP tractor was one of three models in that 4WD line and as indicated earlier, I consider the 435-HP and 485-HP models to lack the necessary system uncertainty to qualify for SR&ED absent specific evidence. The claimed expenditures for project 5 do not distinguish amongst the three models and the appellant used an average hourly rate of $24.78 for every employee in calculating the labour amount, rather than their actual wage\/salary; as a result, the amount claimed by the appellant is inherently inaccurate.\n[78] As a principled basis, I would allow one-third of $2,916,197 as qualified SR&ED expenditures, i.e. $972,065.67 (rounded to $972,066) based on the 535-HP tractor being one of three models in the line.\nConclusion\n[79] The appeal is allowed on the basis that:\na) the appellant\u2019s activities with respect to the 535-HP tractor in project 5 (4WD Phase D Tier II High HP) constituted SR&ED in the 2005 taxation year; and\nb) the appellant incurred qualified SR&ED expenditures in the amount of $972,066 in 2005.\n[80] In light of the appellant\u2019s substantial success on the first issue and partial success on the second issue, the appellant is entitled to costs.\n[81] The parties shall have until March 31, 2023 to reach an agreement as to costs, failing which the appellant shall file written submissions by April 28, 2023 and the respondent shall file a written response by May 29, 2023. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten pages in length. If the parties do not advise the court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received by these dates, then costs shall be awarded to the appellant in accordance with Tariff B.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of February 2023.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2023TCC18\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2012-4373(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBuhler Versatile Inc. v.

Introduction\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Mark Andrews, has instituted an appeal under the informal procedure in respect of a reassessment made under the Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp), as amended (ITA), for the 2018 taxation year.\n[2] Mr. Andrews originally claimed in his 2018 income return a medical expense credit under section 118.2 ITA in respect of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Fernande Brochu. In his return, the Appellant claimed $20,675.44 as medical expenses paid for Mrs. Brochu. Mrs. Brochu resides at a long-term care facility and requires assistance in all daily functions.\n[3] The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) initially assessed Mr. Andrews\u2019 2018 taxation year as filed by notice of assessment dated May 30, 2019. On December 5, 2019, the Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2018 taxation year and disallowed the total amount of medical expenses claimed for Mrs. Brochu in the Appellant\u2019s income return for the year. In response to the Appellant\u2019s notice of objection, the Minister varied the 2018 reassessment and allowed medical expenses for a dependant other in the amount of $607 and allowed a disability tax credit for dependant other in the amount of $8,235. This latest notice of reassessment dated June 17, 2021 is the basis for this appeal.\nII. Issue in dispute\n[4] At the hearing, the parties admitted that all conditions to allow Mr. Andrews\u2019 medical expense credit under section 118.2 are satisfied, except one. It must be determined whether the Appellant\u2019s total medical expenses claimed in filing his income return for the 2018 taxation year in respect of the Appellant\u2019s mother\u2011in\u2011law were paid by the Appellant in accordance with the requirements set out in paragraph (d) of item E of the formula in subsection 118.2(1) ITA. If so, the appeal shall be allowed and the Appellant\u2019s original assessment issued by the Agency for the Appellant\u2019s 2018 taxation year shall prevail. If not, the Appellant\u2019s situation shall be as determined by the notice of reassessment dated June 17, 2021.\n[5] The amounts supporting the medical expense credit claimed by Mr. Andrews are not in dispute.\nIII. Position of the Appellant\n[6] Mr. Andrews argues that for purposes of subsection 118.2(1) ITA medical expenses in respect of a dependant paid by the Appellant include medical expenses paid by the Appellant and the Appellant\u2019s spouse. Almost all of the medical expenses of the Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law were paid by the Appellant\u2019s spouse from a joint bank account held by his spouse and his spouse\u2019s mother. As his spouse had authority over the bank account, medical expenses paid by the Appellant\u2019s spouse from that account meet the definition of \u201cpaid by the individual\u201d for purposes of paragraph (d) of item E in subsection 118.2(1) ITA.\n[7] In addition, the intent of Parliament with respect to the credit for medical expense provided for in section 118.2 ITA is such that the amount paid as medical expenses from the bank account shall be eligible regardless of whether the expense is paid by the Appellant or the Appellant\u2019s spouse. Therefore, the appeal shall be allowed.\nIV. Position of the Respondent\n[8] To be successful, the Appellant himself must have paid the medical expenses claimed for his spouse\u2019s mother. Such expenses were paid from a bank account over which the Appellant had no authority, ownership or other right. Subsection 118.2(1) ITA requires that the medical expenses be paid by the individual claiming the medical expense credit. Such expenses can\u2019t be paid by the individual\u2019s spouse for the purposes of subsection 118.2(1) ITA. The appeal must be dismissed.\nV. Analysis\na) legislative provisions\n[9] For the 2018 taxation year, subsection 118.2(1) ITA reads as follows:\n118.2 (1) For the purpose of computing the tax payable under this Part by an individual for a taxation year, there may be deducted the amount determined by the formula\nA x [(B - C) + D]\nwhere\nA is the appropriate percentage for the taxation year;\nB is the total of the individual\u2019s medical expenses in respect of the individual, the individual\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a child of the individual who has not attained the age of 18 years before the end of the taxation year\n(a) [\u2026]\n(b) [\u2026]\n(c) [\u2026] and\n(d) that were paid by the individual or the individual\u2019s legal representative within any period of 12 months that ends in the taxation year or, if those expenses were in respect of a person (including the individual) who died in the taxation year, within any period of 24 months that includes the day of the person\u2019s death;\nC is the lesser of $2,302 [$1,813] and 3% of the individual\u2019s income for the taxation year; and\nD is the total of all amounts each of which is, in respect of a dependant of the individual (within the meaning assigned by subsection 118(6), other than a child of the individual who has not attained the age of 18 years before the end of the taxation year), the amount determined by the formula\nE - F\nwhere\nE is the total of the individual\u2019s medical expenses in respect of the dependant\n(a) [\u2026]\n(b) [\u2026]\n(c) [\u2026] and\n(d) that were paid by the individual or the individual\u2019s legal representative within the period referred to in paragraph (d) of the description of B; and\nF is the lesser of $2,302 [$1,813] and 3% of the dependant\u2019s income for the taxation year.\n(emphasis added)\nb) applicable treatment\n[10] To qualify as an allowable medical expense, the medical expense must fall into one of two groups referred to in subsection 118.2(1) ITA: (Group A) the expense must have been paid by the taxpayer in respect of medical services provided to the taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner, or a child of the taxpayer who has not attained the age of 18 years before the end of the taxation year; and (Group B) the expense must have been paid by the taxpayer in respect of medical services provided to a dependant who includes a parent of the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner.\n[11] Considering the facts of the present case, Group B is the applicable group. For the 2018 taxation year, the amount of the medical expense credit in respect of dependent relatives is reduced by the lesser of $2,302 and 3 per cent of the dependant's income for the taxation year. Since 2011, there is no upper limit on the claim for a dependent relative's expenses. Item D or E \u2013 F of the formula shown above illustrates this result.\n[12] Mrs. and Mr. Andrews testified at the hearing. Both were generally credible and reliable. In this regard, the Court would like to note the dedication shown by Mrs. and Mr. Andrews in caring for Mrs. Brochu.\n[13] The evidence at the hearing highlighted the situation as applicable in the present case. In 2018, the Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law, Mrs. Brochu, resides at a long-term care facility called Sun Parlor Home Long Term Care in Leamington, Ontario (Sun Parlor). Mrs. Brochu\u2019s husband passed away in 2014. She has osteoporosis and requires assistance in all daily functions including the use of a wheelchair.\n[14] Mrs. Andrews is the Appellant\u2019s spouse and Mrs. Brochu\u2019s only child. Mrs. Andrews has been approved as a personal care provider and as such can visit her mother anytime she needs to and assist her whenever there is a need. They take care of Mrs. Brochu both in terms of personal comfort as well as financial assistance when her financial needs exceed her personal financial autonomy.\n[15] In 2010, the decision to open a bank account was made in order to centralize all Mrs. Brochu\u2019s income and banking operations in one single account. Considering her health conditions, the Caisse Desjardins suggested that a joint account be opened under the names of Mrs. Brochu and Mrs. Andrews (Joint Account). The benefit of this approach was to allow deposits and withdrawals by each of the Joint Account holders without requiring a power of attorney or mandate to do so or co-signatures. This was much easier from the Caisse Desjardins\u2019 perspective.\n[16] Once the Joint Account opened, all Mrs. Brochu\u2019s funds were transferred to the Joint Account and all income received by Mrs. Brochu were now deposited in that account. Also, Desjardins personal pre-authorized debits were set up to allow each of Sun Parlor and Remedy\u2019sRx Pharmacy for Mrs. Brochu\u2019s medication to receive its monthly payment directly from the Joint Account.\n[17] In 2018, the Joint Account was the only bank account of Mrs. Brochu. She had no other investments or assets.\n[18] Except for a $5,000 deposit to the Joint Account made in March 2018 by Mrs. Andrews in order to avoid bank charges otherwise payable on the account, the only deposits to the Joint Account in 2018 were from Mrs. Brochu for a total of $19,054 and only two withdrawals were made each month: the Sun Parlor monthly payment and a Remedy\u2019sRx Pharmacy charge, for an annual total of $19,618.\n[19] In 2018, the Court notes that the opening balance of the Joint Account was $8,027 and the closing balance on December 31 was $12,467. Net of the $5,000 deposit to avoid bank charges, the Joint Account closing balance in 2018 was $7,467. This supports that in 2018 more than 97% of the medical expenses paid from the Joint Account were covered by Mrs. Brochu\u2019s deposits made that year to the account.\n[20] The total accepted eligible medical expenses by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for Mrs. Brochu in 2018 amounted to $20,675. This was the amount claimed by Mr. Andrews as Item E in subsection 118.2(1) ITA. Such amount was then reduced by Item F in subsection 118.2(1) which was 3% of $19,484 or $584. Consequently, the Appellant claimed as Item D in subsection 118.2(1) the amount of $20,090.\n[21] However, the CRA determined that Mrs. Brochu contributed $19,484 in that year to her own medical expenses (i.e., her total 2018 net income), and only the excess could reasonably be considered out of pocket medical expenses paid by the Appellant.\n[22] Considering the issue in dispute as exposed above, the question to be answered by the Court is whether the Appellant paid the $19,484 as medical expenses in respect of Mrs. Brochu. To do so, the Court acknowledges that this amount was paid out of the Joint Account.\n[23] In the present case, paragraph (d) of Item E in subsection 118.2(1) ITA requires that the total of the Appellant\u2019s medical expenses in respect of his dependant must be paid by the Appellant. The possibility that the medical expenses are paid by a legal representative of the Appellant was not raised in this case and is therefore not relevant.\n[24] In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada [1] , the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the following position with respect to statute interpretation of tax laws:\n[10] It has been long established as a matter of statutory interpretation that \u201cthe words of an Act [ITA] are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act [ITA], the object of the Act [ITA], and the intention of Parliament\u201d: see 65302 British Columbia Ltd. v. Canada, 1999 CanLII 639 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 804, at para. 50. The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act [ITA] as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play [sic] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act [ITA] as a harmonious whole.\n[11] As a result of the Duke of Westminster principle (Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.)) that taxpayers are entitled to arrange their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable, Canadian tax legislation received a strict interpretation in an era of more literal statutory interpretation than the present. There is no doubt today that all statutes, including the Income Tax Act, must be interpreted in a textual, contextual and purposive way. However, the particularity and detail of many tax provisions have often led to an emphasis on textual interpretation. Where Parliament has specified precisely what conditions must be satisfied to achieve a particular result, it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended that taxpayers would rely on such provisions to achieve the result they prescribe.\n[\u2026]\n[13] The Income Tax Act remains an instrument dominated by explicit provisions dictating specific consequences, inviting a largely textual interpretation. [\u2026]\n(emphasis added)\n[25] Several years earlier, the Supreme Court of Canada mentioned in Antosko [2] , also a tax decision:\n[34] [\u2026] Where the words of the section are not ambiguous, it is not for this Court to find that the appellants should be disentitled to a deduction because they do not deserve a \"windfall\", as the respondent contends. In the absence of a situation of ambiguity, such that the Court must look to the results of a transaction to assist in ascertaining the intent of Parliament, a normative assessment of the consequences of the application of a given provision is within the ambit of the legislature, not the courts. [\u2026]\n(emphasis added)\n[26] Also, in Antosko:\n[25] [\u2026] While it is true that the courts must view discrete sections of the Income Tax Act in light of the other provisions of the Act and of the purpose of the legislation, and that they must analyze a given transaction in the context of economic and commercial reality, such techniques cannot alter the result where the words of the statute are clear and plain and where the legal and practical effect of the transaction is undisputed: Mattabi Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue), 1988 CanLII 58 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 175, at p. 194; see also Symes v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 695.\n(emphasis added)\n[27] In the year following the Antosko decision, in another tax decision, the Supreme Court of Canada added in Friesen [3] :\n[59] [\u2026] [T]he clear language of the Income Tax Act takes precedence over a court's view of the object and purpose of a provision. As Hogg and Magee stated in Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law, supra, at p. 453:\nIt would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the Income Tax Act if clear language in a detailed provision of the Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court's view of the object and purpose of the provision.\n[60] [\u2026] Therefore, the object and purpose of a provision need only be resorted to when the statutory language admits of some doubt or ambiguity. [\u2026]\n(emphasis added)\n[28] The above excerpt from Hogg and Magee in Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law was reproduced in the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in Canada Trustco and Shell Canada.\n[29] A few years following the Friesen decision, the Supreme Court of Canada mentioned in Shell Canada [4] , a decision dealing with the ITA:\n[43] (\u2026) This Court has consistently held that courts must therefore be cautious before finding within the clear provisions of the Act an unexpressed legislative intention: Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, 1998 CanLII 846 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 147, at para. 41, per Iacobucci J.; Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp., 1997 CanLII 377 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 112, per Iacobucci J.; Antosko, supra, at p. 328, per Iacobucci J. Finding unexpressed legislative intentions under the guise of purposive interpretation runs the risk of upsetting the balance Parliament has attempted to strike in the Act.\n(\u2026)\n[45] (\u2026) The courts\u2019 role is to interpret and apply the Act as it was adopted by Parliament. (\u2026)\n(emphasis added)\n[30] In two recent decisions from the Tax Court of Canada, references were made to Canada Trustco:\n[51] Additionally, the Supreme Court of Canada in Celgene Corp affirmed Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. at paragraph 21:\n[S]tatutory interpretation involves a consideration of the ordinary meaning of the words used and the statutory context in which they are found \u2026 . The words, if clear, will dominate; if not, they yield to an interpretation that best meets the overriding purpose of the statute.3 [Celgene Corp v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 1 at para 21.]\n[52] The Court is of the view that the words of sections 21, 22 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1867 are precise, clear and unequivocal. Thus, the words should dominate the statutory interpretation process. [5]\nand:\n[25] More recently the Supreme Court in Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51, para. 41, referenced that Court\u2019s Canada Trustco above language, confirming the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive analysis\u201d approach to statutory interpretation in a tax context. Also that Court affirmed that, \u201c[w]here the words of a statute are \u2018precise and unequivocal\u2019, their ordinary meaning will play a dominant role.\u201d [6]\n[31] In Hunt [7] , Justice Bocock of this Court referred to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s comments about the analytical process:\n10 A statutory provision must be interpreted according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole.7 [Canada Trustco, para 10] Further, where the words of a statute are precise and unequivocal, those words play a dominant role in the interpretation.8 [Ibid.] The Supreme Court in Canada Trustco also noted that \u201c[t]he relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the Court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\u201d9 [Ibid.]\n11 Recent Supreme Court cases provide further insight into this analytical process. If words of a legislative provision appear to be precise and unequivocal, the Court must still examine the legislative context and purpose.10 [ATCO Gas & Pipelines Ltd v Alberta (Energy & Utilities Board, ), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 SCR 140 at paragraph 48.] An examination of a provision may yield clarity at first glance and yet its context may reveal latent ambiguities.11 [Canada Trustco, para 47]\n(emphasis added)\n[32] Based on these learnings from the Supreme Court of Canada, before resorting to statutory interpretation tools, it is necessary to ask whether the word \u201cindividual\u201d in paragraph (d) of Item E in subsection 118.2 ITA raises any ambiguity. Must it mean strictly the individual claiming the medical expense credit or might it also mean, as claimed by the Appellant, the individual\u2019s spouse?\n[33] Turning to the \u201ctextual\u201d component of the Canada Trustco analysis, the wording of paragraph (d) only refers to the individual claiming the medical expense credit as the payor of the expenses. The provision does not refer to the individual\u2019s spouse or the common-law partner of the individual like the gifts credit under section 118.1 ITA where the total charitable gifts of an individual for purposes of the credit explicitly include gifts made by the individual, the individual\u2019s spouse or common-law partner. This is not the case in section 118.2 ITA.\n[34] A plain reading of paragraph (d) reveals little if any doubt as to the scope of the test to be met by the Appellant. He is the only person who must have paid the expenses. The statutory language appears clear.\n[35] With regard to the analysis of the \u201ccontextual\u201d component referred to in Canada Trustco, it would appear that subsection 118.2(3) ITA is the only provision deeming \u201cthe individual\u201d to have paid for purposes of subsection 118.2(1) ITA an amount that was in fact paid by someone else. This provision reads as follows:\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (1),\n(a) any amount included in computing an individual\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment in respect of a medical expense described in subsection (2) paid or provided by an employer at a particular time shall be deemed to be a medical expense paid by the individual at that time; and\n[\u2026]\n(emphasis added)\n[36] Although subsection 118.2(3) ITA expands the scope of \"the individual\" to include \"an employer\" in the context of the provision, there is no other deeming rule in the ITA applicable in the present case that could do the same.\n[37] One could be of the view that, if Parliament added a deeming rule for \u201can employer\u201d, why would it have refrained from doing the same for \u201cthe individual\u2019s spouse or common-law partner\u201d or adding \u201cthe individual\u2019s spouse or common\u2011law partner\u201d in paragraph (d) if this was one of the meanings to be given of paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA?\n[38] In other provisions of the ITA including in section 118.1 ITA dealing with the gifts credit, Parliament mentioned \"individual or the individual's spouse\" 22 times (a common-law partner reference is also included in 21 out of these 22 occurrences). As none of these formulations is reproduced in paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA, the situation supports the absence of ambiguity: if Parliament had expressed the intention to refer to and include the spouse or common-law partner as having paid for the medical expenses claimed by the individual in subsection 118.2(1), an explicit mention would have been in place.\n[39] Regarding the \u201cpurposive\u201d component analysis in Canada Trustco, the technical notes released by the Department of Finance when amendments to section 118.2 ITA were introduced over the years add some comfort to the meaning of paragraph 118.2(1)B(d) and E(d) ITA. In the 2011 federal Budget Supplementary Information, the Department of Finance mentioned:\nSubsection 118.2(1) provides a formula for the calculation of an individual's medical expense tax credit. The description of D in that formula provides a limit to the amount of medical expenses that an individual may claim for a taxation year in respect of their dependant (other than the individual's spouse, the individual's common-law partner or a child of the individual who has not attained the age of 18 years before the end of the taxation year). This limit is the lesser of $10,000 and the amount by which the expenses paid by the individual on behalf of the dependant exceed the dependant's medical expense threshold for the year (which is the lesser of 3% of the dependant's net income and an indexed amount ($2,052 in 2011)).\nThe description of D in the formula is amended to remove the $10,000 limit.\n[emphasis added]\n[40] About the Medical Expense Tax Credit for Other Dependants, the same document in paragraph 33 states:\nThe Medical Expense Tax Credit provides income tax relief for taxpayers with above-average medical and disability expenses in recognition that these individuals have a reduced ability to pay income tax as a result of incurring those expenses. A taxpayer may claim a credit in respect of eligible expenses incurred in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse or common-law partner, or his or her child who is under 18 years of age.\nCaregivers may also claim the Medical Expense Tax Credit in respect of eligible expenses incurred in respect of a \u201cdependent\u201d relative if the caregiver pays medical or disability-related expenses of the dependent relative. For this purpose, a \u201cdependent\u201d relative is defined as a child who is 18 years of age or older, or a grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece or nephew, who is dependent on the taxpayer for support.\n[emphasis added]\n[41] In June 2006, the budget documents of the Department of Finance referred to section 118.2 ITA as follows:\nSubsection 118.2(1) provides the calculation of an individual's medical expense tax credit (METC). The description of D in that subsection includes the individual's medical expenses amounts paid by the individual in respect of a dependant (other than an individual's spouse, the individual's common-law partner or child of the individual who has not attained the age of 18 years) to the lesser of $5,000 and the amount by which the expenses paid by the individual on behalf of the dependant exceed the dependant's medical expense threshold for the year or 3% of net income.\n[emphasis added]\n[42] On tax relief for caregivers under section 118.2 ITA as it existed in 2005, the federal Budget Supplementary Information mentioned:\nTaxpayers paying medical or disability-related expenses on behalf of a dependent relative may claim those expenses under the medical expense tax credit (METC). For this purpose, a dependent relative is defined as a child who is 18 years of age or older, or a grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece or nephew, who is dependent on the taxpayer for support.\n[emphasis added]\n[43] None of these notes refers to \u201cindividual\u2019s spouse\u201d or \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d of the individual claiming the medical expense credit.\n[44] Moreover, it is interesting to note that the 2011 technical notes above referred to the medical expense tax credit as a credit providing relief for taxpayers with accumulated medical expenses. The Court takes this excerpt to mean that eligibility for the credit can be considered to the extent that the taxpayer's financial capacity is adversely affected by the expenses incurred. Subject to the specific exception of having paid personally for the medical expense, the purpose of the credit would not be to compensate a taxpayer for any other form of assistance provided with respect to expenses incurred by another person or for the support provided to his or her loved ones, no matter how commendable.\n[45] Paragraph 118.2(3)(b) ITA supports this interpretation as it denies eligibility for the medical credit in respect of medical expenses for which the individual is entitled to a refund:\n(b) there shall not be included as a medical expense of an individual any expense to the extent that\n(i) the individual,\n(ii) the person referred to in subsection (2) as the patient,\n(iii) any person related to a person referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii), or\n(iv) the legal representative of any person referred to in any of subparagraphs (i) to (iii)\nis entitled to be reimbursed for the expense, except to the extent that the amount of the reimbursement is required to be included in computing income and is not deductible in computing taxable income.\n(emphasis added)\n[46] None of the authors discussing the medical expense credit that the Court was able to identify referred to the right of an individual claiming the credit to consider medical expenses other than the expenses paid by the individual, with one exception. [8] The Court identified the 2015 article listed below has one exception referring, we assume, to the CRA\u2019s administrative policy discussed below.\n[47] The CRA would appear to have a somewhat liberal view of an individual's medical expenses eligible for the medical expense credit. The Court noted two sources that may support this position, one of which was introduced into evidence by the Appellant. [9] The 2018 Medical Expenses Guide (RC4065(E) Rev. 18), which outlines the medical expense credit, mentions about an individual's eligible expenses:\nHow do you claim medical expenses?\nYou can claim medical expenses on line 330 or 331 of your Schedule 1.\nLine 330 \u2013 You can claim the total eligible medical expenses you or your spouse or common-law partner paid for any of the following persons:\n\u25a0 yourself\n\u25a0 your spouse or common-law partner\n\u25a0 your or your spouse\u2019s or common-law partner\u2019s children born in 2001 or later\nLine 331 \u2013 You can claim the part of eligible medical expenses you or your spouse or common-law partner paid for any of the following persons who depended on you for support:\n\u25a0 your or your spouse\u2019s or common-law partner\u2019s children born in 2000 or earlier, or grandchildren\n\u25a0 your or your spouse\u2019s or common-law partner\u2019s parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, or nieces who were residents of Canada at any time in the year\nYou have to calculate, for each dependant, the medical expenses that you are claiming on line 331.\n[emphasis added]\n[48] The same guide also refers to the following example:\nExample\nRichard and Pauline have two children, Jen and Rob. They have reviewed their medical expenses and decided that the 12-month period ending in 2018 they will use to calculate their claim is July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. They had the following expenses:\nRichard\n$1,500\nPauline\n$1,000\nJen (their 16-year-old daughter)\n$1,800\nRob (their 19-year-old son)\n$1,000\nTotal medical expenses\n$5,300\nSince Jen is under 18, Richard and Pauline can combine her medical expenses with theirs, for a total of $4,300. Either Richard or Pauline can claim this amount on line 330 of their Schedule 1. Since Rob is over 18, his medical expenses should be claimed on line 331.\nPauline\u2019s net income (on line 236 of her return) is $32,000. She calculates 3% of that amount, which is $960. Because the result is less than $2,302, she subtracts $960 from $4,300. The difference is $3,340, which is the amount she could claim on Schedule 1.\nRichard\u2019s net income is $48,000. He calculates 3% of that amount, which is $1,440. Because the result is less than $2,302, he subtracts $1,440 from $4,300. The difference is $2,860, which is the amount he could claim on Schedule 1.\nIn this case, it is better for Pauline to claim all the expenses for Richard, herself, and their daughter Jen on line 330.\nTo decide who should claim the medical expenses for Rob on line 331, Richard and Pauline will have to make the same calculation using Rob\u2019s net income.\n[49] This CRA\u2019s practice is an administrative position. It has no legal force or basis before the Court. [10] However, for their own reasons, it appears that the CRA decided not to apply this practice in this case. And unless this Court is the view that there is ambiguity in the law, the Court is bound to apply the law as Parliament wrote it.\n[50] Based on the foregoing review, the remarks made in paragraph [34] above remain appropriate and applicable in the circumstances, particularly with respect to the identity of the individual having paid the eligible medical expenses in paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA. This Court is of the view that paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) requires that the medical expenses in respect of a dependant expected to be included in computing the medical tax credit claimed by an individual must be paid by the individual himself. There is no ambiguity that could be reasonably made from the wording used by Parliament within this provision. It is even more difficult to find ambiguity in a context where the ambiguity would need to arise from the absence of words and the statute as written is clear in its scope, albeit restrictive in the eyes of some. Unfortunately, the Appellant is asking the Court to rewrite the provision, which the Court is not allowed to do. [11]\n[51] The absence of the words such as \u201cindividual\u2019s spouse\u201d and \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d in paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA while present for other purposes in the ITA is significant and indicative of the intention not to extend the payment of medical expenses to persons other than the individual claiming the medical credit. The situation in section 118.1 ITA is particularly telling, where the gift credit was originally for an individual\u2019s own gifts, the provision was subsequently amended to accept gifts made by the individual's spouse or common-law partner consistent with the CRA\u2019s then administrative practice. [12]\n[52] Mr. Andrews\u2019 situation presents 2 challenges among others. The first one is the absence of the words spouse or common-law spouse in paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA forcing the Appellant to establish that he paid Mrs. Brochu\u2019s medical expenses himself. The second is that such expenses must not be reimbursable and certainly not been assumed by Mrs. Brochu herself.\n[53] The evidence showed that the total amount paid by Mrs. Brochu from the Joint Account and claimed as medical expenses by the Appellant amounts to approximately $19,500, which is about Mrs. Brochu\u2019s 2018 net income accepted by the parties and the amount deposited in the Joint Account that year by Mrs. Brochu.\n[54] The evidence also explained the reasons the Joint Account was opened, how funds, contributions and deposits were made to this account, who are signatories to the account, and the monthly pre-authorized withdrawals. These details that were supported through mainly by the testimony of Mrs. Andrews, and the documentary evidence support the position that Mrs. Brochu directly contributed in 2018 to her own medical expenses more specifically with monthly payments made to Sun Parlor and the Remedy\u2019sRx Pharmacy. The Appellant did not support such payments as required by paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) ITA. The evidence did not establish that the Appellant had any authority over the Joint Account in 2018. This aspect is detrimental to the Appellant. And regardless of the fact that the Court does not confirm that it should be given any weight, the position of Mrs. Andrews on the Joint Account is not relevant to the Appellant\u2019s position.\n[55] In addition, and without being dispositive of this appeal, it would have been important to consider paragraph 118.2(3)(b) ITA for the purpose of determining whether anyone other than Mrs. Brochu is entitled to the medical expenses paid by her. The notion of paying the medical expense for the purposes of paragraph 118.2(1)E(d) cannot simply mean the action of paying. The financial consideration of the complete operation and the legal context governing the rights of the parties involved must be considered in order to reach a reasonable interpretation of the text.\n[56] Finally, Mr. Andrews noted that the manner in which the transactions were completed in this case could have been completed in a different manner and produced the same result. Accordingly, the manner should not play a dominant role. In response to this contention, we refer to the comment made by the Supreme Court of Canada in Shell Canada regarding how a taxpayer can expect to be taxed:\n[\u2026] Unless the Act [ITA] provides otherwise, a taxpayer is entitled to be taxed based on what it actually did, not based on what it could have done, and certainly not based on what a less sophisticated taxpayer might have done.\n[emphasis added]\n[57] For all these reasons, the appeal of the reassessment relating to the Appellant\u2019s 2018 taxation year will be dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of February 2023.\n\u201cJ.

Introduction\n[1] These are appeals that Monique Groulx has filed against the following redeterminations and reassessments made pursuant to sections 122.6 and 122.61 and subsections 118(1), 163(2) and 248(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the ITA) and section 6302 of the Income Tax Regulations:\n(a) the redeterminations dated July 19, 2019, regarding the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 base taxation years;\n(b) the May 20, 2020, redetermination regarding the CCB for the 2018 base taxation year; and;\n(c) the reassessments dated July 22, 2019, regarding the wholly dependent person credit for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years and the penalty assessed under subsection 163(2) of the ITA for the 2016 and 2017 taxation years;\n[2] For the purposes of making and upholding the reassessments and redeterminations under appeal, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) relied on the following assumptions of fact set out in section 10 of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal (translation):\n(a) the appellant is the mother of two children:\ni. F, son born in 1985\nii. J, son born in 2002\n(allowed)\n(b) J. is the child of the appellant and Michel Cournoyer (the parties);\n(allowed)\n(c) during the period at issue, the parties lived at the same address at 139 Durocher Street in Gatineau, Quebec;\n(allowed)\n(d) the parties lived together;\n(denied)\n(e) during the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years, the net incomes of the parties were as follows:\nTaxation year\nAppellant\nMr. Cournoyer\nTotal\n2015\n$64,772\n$720\n$65,492\n2016\n$70,239\n$17,006\n$87,245\n2017\n$69,786\n$59,704\n$129,490\n2018\n$71,106\n$30,576\n$101,682\n(The appellant\u2019s earnings were allowed. The appellant was unaware of the facts of paragraph 10(e) of the Reply regarding Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s net income because the appellant had not been previously informed of this information.)\n(f) The Canada Child Benefits were based on the marital status and family income of the eligible individuals.\n(disregarded)\n[3] The appellant and Michel Cournoyer were the only witnesses at the hearing. Ms. Groulx testified on her own behalf and did not call any other witnesses. Mr. Cournoyer was the only witness called by the respondent. The appellant did not cross-examine Mr. Cournoyer. The Court considers the appellant\u2019s testimony credible, and although some explanations were hesitant or vague, the Court finds her testimony sufficiently credible. Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony was more targeted because it was limited to answering the questions he was asked. The Court considers Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony credible as a whole, although certain parts of his testimony proved difficult to reconcile, particularly with regard to the events coinciding with the periods and years at issue. Subject to these remarks, both testimonies are accepted.\n[4] During the preliminary questions, the respondent conceded to the withdrawal of the gross negligence penalty referred to in subsection 163(2) of the ITA, which was assessed with respect to the appellant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 taxation years. Accordingly, the appeal from the 2016 taxation year and the 2017 taxation year will be allowed on the basis of this concession.\nII. Issue\n[5] The only issue in dispute is whether, during the periods and years under appeal, the appellant and Michel Cournoyer were common-law partners or living in a common-law partnership for purposes of section 122.6 and paragraph 118(1)(b) of the ITA.\nIII. Background\n[6] Ms. Groulx, a retired teacher, said she had known Mr. Cournoyer for about 20 years. During the relevant periods and years, Mr. Cournoyer was employed in the construction and renovation industry, except for a period when he was unemployed. During this period, Ms. Groulx already had a first son, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, born in 1985. She dated Mr. Cournoyer in the early 2000s when he occupied an apartment in a building owned by her father on Joffre Street in Gatineau, Quebec. During this period, Ms. Groulx was already living on Durocher Street in Gatineau, Quebec.\n[7] In 2002, Ms. Groulx gave birth to Jacob. Mr. Cournoyer was the father. Although Mr. Cournoyer still occupied an apartment on Joffre Street in Gatineau, they were now common-law partners, according to the appellant. Mr. Cournoyer was more involved in the family\u2019s daily life on Durocher Street in Gatineau. He was primarily at the Durocher Street residence in Gatineau during the day and occasionally at night. When he spent the night at the Durocher Street residence in Gatineau, he and the appellant slept in separate rooms after Jacob was born. The appellant and Mr. Cournoyer were never married and never discussed marriage.\n[8] In 2005, the situation deteriorated to the point where police intervention was required, which prompted Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s hasty departure from the appellant\u2019s residence. According to the appellant, this event was the final outcome of a marital situation that had been deteriorating for some time. The appellant confirmed that they were no longer common-law partners after Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s departure. He stopped visiting although he occasionally visited Jacob only. During his testimony, Mr. Cournoyer confirmed that they were no longer common-law partners, but was unable to confirm the exact year, although it was between 2005 and 2008 at the latest.\n[9] After his father died in 2008, Mr. Cournoyer had to leave the Joffre Street residence in Gatineau. At that time, the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer discussed the possibility of her renting him a room on Durocher Street in Gatineau, to which the appellant agreed. Ms. Groulx had already rented a room in the past and therefore understood what this decision could entail. The presence of a man who was also Jacob\u2019s father and the financial assistance that the rental would provide were the main reasons for the appellant\u2019s decision. Mr. Cournoyer continued to rent a room after the years and periods at issue. Jacob lives with the appellant and lived with her during the periods and years at issue.\nIV. Position of the appellant\n[10] The appellant alleged that although Mr. Cournoyer rented a room in her home, she and Mr. Cournoyer were not living in a common-law partnership after 2005, when the police intervened. The common-law relationship ended no later than 2005 and has never resumed. Because of their personal economic situation, Mr. Cournoyer rented a room at the appellant\u2019s residence even if they had a son together, Jacob, in 2002. She also said that during the periods and years at issue, they never lived together as a couple or common-law partners. At the time, she supported herself and her children on her own. Mr. Cournoyer was never part of the household during the periods and years at issue and, except for the rent he paid her for a room, he never provided her with financial support or any other form of support during this period.\n[11] Although the appellant recognized that the situation might seem unusual, in actual fact, there was no conjugal relationship between Mr. Cournoyer and the appellant nor any reason to consider them common-law partners during the periods at issue. Although she knew that she could not control what the neighbours thought, the appellant said she had always maintained the same position regarding the relationship, albeit limited, that she had with Mr. Cournoyer. She could not accept that the tax authorities considered her Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s common-law partner for the purposes of the periods and years at issue.\nV. Position of the respondent\n[12] According to the respondent, during the periods at issue, the appellant lived in a conjugal relationship that constituted a \u201ccommon-law partnership\u201d between \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d as defined for the purposes of the ITA. Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s presence in the appellant\u2019s residence and the behaviour and relationship that the parties maintained during the periods at issue were indicative of a common-law partnership as developed by the courts. The respondent was of the opinion that Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s income should therefore be taken into account in computing the CCB amounts to which the appellant was entitled throughout these periods. Furthermore, this relationship would make the appellant ineligible for the wholly dependent person credit referred to in paragraph 118(1)(b) of the ITA for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years.\nVI. Analysis\n[13] For the purposes of Subdivision a.1 of Division E of Part I of the ITA, the CCB requires that, for the purpose of determining the adjusted income of the individual claiming the CCB, the income of the person who was the common-law partner at the end of the year must be taken into account. To be eligible for the wholly dependent person credit referred to in paragraph 118(1)(b) of the ITA, the claimant must not be living in a common-law partnership at any time in the year.\n[14] For the purposes of the CCB, section 122.6 of the ITA defines \u201ccohabiting spouse or common-law partner\u201d as follows:\n\u201ccohabiting spouse or common-law partner\u201d of an individual at any time means the person who at that time is the individual\u2019s spouse or common-law partner and who is not at that time living separate and apart from the individual and, for the purpose of this definition, a person shall not be considered to be living separate and apart from an individual at any time unless they were living separate and apart at that time, because of a breakdown of their marriage or common-law partnership, for a period of at least 90 days that includes that time.\n(Emphasis added)\n[15] For the purposes of the ITA, the definition of \u201ccommon-law partnership\u201d is provided in subsection 248(1):\ncommon-law partnership means the relationship between two persons who are common-law partners of each other. (union de fait)\n(Emphasis added)\n[16] For the purposes of the ITA, the definition of \u201ccommon-law partner\u201d is provided in subsection 248(1):\ncommon-law partner, with respect to a taxpayer at any time, means a person who cohabits at that time in a conjugal relationship with the taxpayer and\n(a) has so cohabited throughout the 12-month period that ends at that time, or\nwould be the parent of a child of whom the taxpayer is a parent, if this Act were read without reference to paragraphs 252(1)(c) and (e) and subparagraph 252(2)(a)(iii),\nand, for the purpose of this definition, where at any time the taxpayer and the person cohabit in a conjugal relationship, they are, at any particular time after that time, deemed to be cohabiting in a conjugal relationship unless they were living separate and apart at the particular time for a period of at least 90 days that includes the particular time because of a breakdown of their conjugal relationship.\n(Emphasis added)\n[17] It is not in dispute that the appellant considered herself Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s common-law partner until the police had to intervene in 2005. According to the appellant, the situation had then escalated to the point of no return for the couple. During his testimony, Mr. Cournoyer said the couple\u2019s separation was attributable to mixed messages.\n[18] In this case, to establish that she was no longer Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s common-law partner and to entitle her to appeal in light of each of the periods and years at issue, the appellant must demonstrate that, after that time, she lived separate and apart from Mr. Cournoyer for a period of at least 90 days because of the breakdown of their common-law partnership. In other words, given the length of the period at issue, the appellant will succeed if she can establish that she and Mr. Cournoyer were no longer living in a conjugal relationship during the periods and years at issue.\n[19] To determine whether the appellant no longer lived in a conjugal relationship even if she lived under the same roof as Mr. Cournoyer, we should refer to the factors developed in Molodowich v. Penttinen, (1980), 1980 CanLII 1537 (ON SC) [Molodowich], affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in M v. H, [1999] 2 SCR 3 [M v. H] and taken up by this Court in Milot v. R. , [1996] 1 CTC 2247 [Milot] and Aukstinaitis v. Canada , 2008 TCC 104 [Aukstinaitis]. Our Court also referred to the decisions in Pam Sanford v. The Queen, [2001] DTC 12 (affirmed in Federal Court of Appeal 2002 DTC 7442) and Lavoie v. Canada, 2001 DTC 5083 (FCA) which followed Milot.\n[20] In M v. H the Supreme Court of Canada made the following comments with regard to Molodowich:\n59 Molodowich v. Penttinen (1980) 17 R.F.L. (2d) 376 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), sets out the generally accepted characteristics of a conjugal relationship. They include shared shelter, sexual and personal behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and children, as well as the societal perception of the couple. However, it was recognized that these elements may be present in varying degrees and not all are necessary for the relationship to be found to be conjugal. (. . .) In order to come within the definition, neither opposite\u2011sex couples nor same\u2011sex couples are required to fit precisely the traditional marital model to demonstrate that the relationship is \u201cconjugal\u201d.\n60 Certainly an opposite\u2011sex couple may, after many years together, be considered to be in a conjugal relationship although they have neither children nor sexual relations. Obviously the weight to be accorded the various elements or factors to be considered in determining whether an opposite\u2011sex couple is in a conjugal relationship will vary widely and almost infinitely. The same must hold true of same\u2011sex couples. Courts have wisely determined that the approach to determining whether a relationship is conjugal must be flexible. This must be so, for the relationships of all couples will vary widely. (. . .)\n(Emphasis added)\n[21] As reiterated on many occasions by this Court, in particular in the decision rendered by the Honourable Mr. Justice Favreau of this Court in Perron v. Canada, 2010 TCC 547, the elements and circumstances generally accepted by Canadian jurisprudence in order to establish whether an unmarried couple are common-law partners include the following factors established in Molodowich:\nShelter\n(a) Did the parties live under the same roof?\n(b) What were the sleeping arrangements?\n(c) Did anyone else occupy or share the available accommodation?\nSexual and personal conduct\n(a) Did the parties have sexual relations? If not, why not?\n(b) Did they maintain an attitude of fidelity to each other?\n(c) What were their feelings toward each other?\n(d) Did they communicate on a personal level?\n(e) Did they eat their meals together?\n(f) What, if anything, did they do to assist each other with problems or during illness?\n(g) Did they buy gifts for each other on special occasions?\nServices\nWhat was the conduct and habit of the parties in relation to:\n(a) preparation of meals;\n(b) washing and mending clothes;\n(c) shopping;\n(d) household maintenance; and\n(e) any other domestic services?\nSocial\n(a) Did they participate together or separately in neighbourhood and community activities?\n(b) What were the arrangements concerning the acquisition and ownership of property?\nSocietal\nWhat was the attitude and conduct of the community towards each of them and as a couple?\nSupport (Economic):\n(a) What were the financial arrangements between the parties regarding the provision of or contribution towards the necessaries of life (food, clothing, shelter, recreation, etc.)?\n(b) What were the arrangements concerning the acquisition and ownership of property?\n(c) Was there any special financial arrangement between them which both agreed would be determinant of their overall relationship?\nChildren\nWhat was the attitude and conduct of the parties concerning children?\n[22] If we apply these factors to the particular facts specific to the appellant, the following conclusions can be drawn:\nShelter\n(a) Did the parties live under the same roof?\n(b) What were the sleeping arrangements?\n(c) Did anyone else occupy or share the available accommodation?\n[23] The evidence clearly established that the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer lived under the same roof with their son Jacob during the periods and years at issue. The appellant and Mr. Cournoyer testified that they each had their own bedroom in which they kept their personal effects, including a television set in Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s case. They never shared the same bed. During the periods at issue, the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer each occupied a room upstairs in the Durocher Street residence in Gatineau. Jacob occupied the main floor bedroom.\n[24] According to case law, it is accepted that the mere fact of living under the same roof does not provide a sufficient basis on which to find that two people are common-law partners. In Kelner v. R., [1995] TCJ No. 1130, the Honourable Mr. Justice Bowman (as he then was) said the following on this subject:\n16 I start from the premise that it is possible for spouses, as a matter of law, to live separate and apart even though they are under the same roof.\n[25] The Honourable Mr. Justice Rip (the Associate Chief Judge) made the following comment in Aukstinaitis, above:\n23 The fact that the Appellant lived with Mr. Mongeon under the same roof is not fatal to her case. It is actually only one of the factors to take into account.\n[26] This test is therefore not determinative in the circumstances.\nSexual and personal conduct\n(a) Did the parties have sexual relations? If not, why not?\n(b) Did they maintain an attitude of fidelity to each other?\n(c) What were their feelings toward each other?\n(d) Did they communicate on a personal level?\n(e) Did they eat their meals together?\n(f) What, if anything, did they do to assist each other with problems or during illness?\n(g) Did they buy gifts for each other on special occasions?\n[27] The appellant testified that she had not had any sexual relations with Mr. Cournoyer since his hasty departure in 2005. The Court\u2019s understanding is that the absence of sexual relationships since that time is attributable to the absence of a marital relationship. During the period from 2005 to 2008, Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s visits at the Durocher Street residence in Gatineau were far apart and only involved visiting Jacob. The appellant did not visit Mr. Cournoyer on Joffre Street in Gatineau.\n[28] She described their relationship since 2008 as civilized and often limited to the essentials. The death of Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s father led to discussions between the two parties about renting a room. The appellant had already rented a room in the past and was therefore in a position to understand the consequences that such a situation involved. The Court learned from the appellant\u2019s testimony that she was a woman whose social life during the relevant periods was limited to few activities and whose circle of friends seemed to be absent. The Court got the impression that she had a more introverted and reserved personality. In this case, the Court believes that three years after her marriage ended, it was reasonable for the appellant to decide to rent strictly for economic reasons, occasional mutual assistance and the good of her son, without the rental being associated with a situation between common-law partners for the purposes of the ITA.\n[29] The Court accepts the appellant\u2019s and Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony that they did not associate with other people during the periods at issue and that they therefore remained faithful to one another. However, the Court is of the opinion that the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer were not faithful to one another because of their marital or couple relationship. Their choice to seldom if ever see one another was attributable to personal decisions they made that had nothing to do with the other person.\n[30] Based on the evidence, the Court does not accept that the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer had feelings for each other during the periods at issue that could be considered feelings shared by common-law or married spouses. The situations where the couple shared confidences, discussed matters, interacted and bonded, which would normally be present at one level or another in a marital relationship, appear to the Court to be almost non-existent in this case. The respondent compared the marital relationship of the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer to that of an old couple. A conjugal relationship can certainly evolve, change, vary and take a different form throughout married life. However, the Court did not note such a situation in this case with regard to the periods and years at issue.\n[31] They seldom ate meals together. Mr. Cournoyer made his own meal which Jacob could share given his father\u2019s more regular schedule. Mr. Cournoyer washed his own dishes. The appellant would then prepare her own meal and wash her dishes.\n[32] During the periods and years at issue, the appellant would occasionally allow Mr. Cournoyer to use her car because he did not have one. The evidence heard led the Court to believe that the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer seldom provided each other with mutual assistance. Mutual assistance seemed mainly limited to situations where the appellant was unable to accompany Jacob outside the home on school or extracurricular activities. The Court considers this assistance minimal in the circumstances.\n[33] According to the appellant, Mr. Cournoyer never organized a party for her and never gave her any gifts.\n[34] In the words of Rip J. in Aukstinaitis, above, it seems that the contacts and exchanges between the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer were minimal and limited to what one would expect of anyone who has to live with another person, share certain spaces with that person, and try to live in a civilized manner. Mutual assistance between the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer appears minimal in the circumstances.\n[35] The Court is of the opinion that the evidence does not support the finding that this second factor undermines the appellant\u2019s position.\nServices\nWhat was the conduct and habit of the parties in relation to:\n(a) preparation of meals;\n(b) washing and mending clothes;\n(c) shopping;\n(d) household maintenance; and\n(e) any other domestic services?\n[36] According to the testimony, the adults did not prepare any meals together. Mr. Cournoyer was early to bed and early to rise. In the evening, he prepared supper and ate first with Jacob who usually preferred the food his father prepared. The appellant prepared her own meal, although she would occasionally share the meal that Mr. Cournoyer prepared. The appellant admitted that she occasionally ate at the same time as he did, although Mr. Cournoyer had his own schedule which could fit in better with Jacob\u2019s schedule. However, Mr. Cournoyer said they seldom ate at the same time. They washed their own dishes.\n[37] The appellant did not do Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s laundry. He had access to the laundry room and did his own laundry. Nor did she look after Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s clothing. Mr. Cournoyer also had access to the kitchen, his bedroom, the bathroom and, according to the appellant, the living room, but as little as possible. She generally took care of the housekeeping, with the exception of Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s room, which he looked after himself. Mr. Cournoyer was more involved in outdoor chores, such as shovelling the snow after heavy snowfalls.\n[38] Mr. Cournoyer did not have a car. They may have driven to the store together on a few occasions and done their shopping on their own. In the circumstances, they may also have shared the cost of certain items since they were living under the same roof. In any event, they each did their own groceries and paid for their own purchases. The appellant then paid for the gas for her car, as well as all the other household expenses, except for certain times when Mr. Cournoyer would pay for the gas when he was allowed to use the car.\n[39] Mr. Cournoyer did not look after any maintenance and repair work on the residence or pay to have this work done. Mr. Cournoyer did not perform this work nor was he generally interested in doing it. Rather, the appellant contacted her eldest son regarding maintenance work and repairs.\n[40] Overall, this factor appears to be consistent with the absence of a marital relationship.\nSocial\n(a) Did they participate together or separately in neighbourhood and community activities?\n(b) What were the arrangements concerning the acquisition and ownership of property?\n[41] According to the appellant\u2019s testimony, she did not engage in any outside social activities with Mr. Cournoyer. In this regard, she did not mention any trips. The two witnesses at the hearing did not appear to be very interested in neighbourhood and community activities. The appellant seemed to be a rather reserved person, not very concerned with neighbourhood and community life.\n[42] When the parties were a couple, the appellant admitted that they would visit her family together. Mr. Cournoyer does not visit his family. On the other hand, he maintained some ties with the appellant\u2019s family after the breakdown of the marital relationship. The appellant related the example of the 2015 Christmas celebration at the Durocher residence in Gatineau when Mr. Cournoyer was renting a room there. The appellant\u2019s mother, who was at the celebration, had invited Mr. Cournoyer to join them, although he was not initially invited. Mr. Cournoyer had maintained a good relationship with the appellant\u2019s mother, but did not feel as though he had been invited to the celebrations. That evening, the appellant did not object to Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s joining them. Mr. Cournoyer also said that when he was invited to an event, he did not stay long because he usually went to bed early.\n[43] According to the Court, this factor indicates that Mr. Cournoyer had maintained certain ties with the appellant\u2019s family. It also seems that Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s presence during these get-togethers with their son Jacob favoured more cordial relations. The appellant did not confirm that she maintained ties with Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s family.\n[44] This factor does not appear to the Court to be decisive in this case. It is true that Mr. Cournoyer maintained certain ties with the appellant\u2019s family. However, these ties did not appear to the Court to involve the appellant. Rather, Mr. Cournoyer developed ties with the appellant\u2019s family when he was accompanied by his son Jacob.\nSocietal\nWhat was the attitude and conduct of the community towards each of them and as a couple?\n[45] The appellant admitted that on the rare occasions that they went out together, others might believe that she and Mr. Cournoyer were common-law partners. It was natural for them to come to this conclusion because she and Mr. Cournoyer were accompanied by Jacob on these outings. The Court learned from the appellant\u2019s testimony that these public outings were rare, particularly during the periods and years at issue. As soon as the issue of common-law partners was raised, the appellant said she always indicated that they were not common-law partners. The appellant never confirmed that they introduced themselves as common-law partners. Mr. Cournoyer testified that he had always considered himself single, including when he filed his income tax returns. She also did not participate in any social activities with Mr. Cournoyer or visit his family with him. On the few occasions that Mr. Cournoyer ever met with members of the appellant\u2019s family, he was accompanied only by his son.\n[46] In short, this factor does not appear sufficiently decisive in this case to provide evidence of a common-law partnership. The activities or opportunities during which they could be seen as common-law partners were few and far between and completely absent when they visited their respective families.\nSupport (Economic)\nSupport (Economic):\n(a) What were the financial arrangements between the parties regarding the provision of or contribution towards the necessaries of life (food, clothing, shelter, recreation, etc.)?\n(b) What were the arrangements concerning the acquisition and ownership of property?\n(c) Was there any special financial arrangement between them which both agreed would be determinant of their overall relationship?\n[47] According to the evidence and subject to the following, the appellant paid for all expenses relating to her residence and car. During the periods and years at issue, there was an arrangement between the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer pursuant to which he paid the appellant rent for a room and access to rooms in the Durocher residence in Gatineau. Although testimony at the hearing provided few details on how this monthly payment had been calculated and what it included, the Court noted that Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s usual monthly rental payment was for his room and his share of household costs. They each incurred their own recreational, personal, and food and clothing expenses. The appellant also paid for Jacob\u2019s expenses. There was no other agreement between the parties.\n[48] It should be noted that Mr. Cournoyer was unemployed for a time during the periods and years at issue. The testimony is not clear regarding this event or the relevant length of this time during the periods and years at issue. During this time, Mr. Cournoyer did not make his monthly payments to the appellant. The appellant questioned the length of this period during which she did not receive any compensation. Also, she maintained that Mr. Cournoyer provided compensation when his economic situation was subsequently corrected. During his testimony, Mr. Cournoyer alluded to the fact that when this ill-defined period ended, he paid the appellant a larger amount. The parties did not provide a clear reason for this additional amount. On the other hand, it is clear that the appellant started receiving this additional compensation after Mr. Cournoyer went back to work. The Court considers that the duration of this unemployment for the purposes of the relevant period was longer than one year. The Court therefore finds that the evidence shows that the appellant supported Mr. Cournoyer financially during at least part of the time he was unemployed, which is included in the period at issue, notwithstanding some financial compensation paid thereafter.\n[49] In Aukstinaitis, above, Rip J. encountered a somewhat similar situation involving a monetary arrangement:\nThe extent of Mr. Mongeon\u2019s financial contribution to this cohabitation is unclear, but it appears that he covered at least the excess costs that his presence generated. It is true that such an arrangement could, at first sight, appear \u201cabusive\u201d for people who are not living in a common-law partnership. But one must bear in mind that Mr. Mongeon went to live with the Appellant after going bankrupt, and that she wanted him to be in a position to leave her residence as quickly as possible.\n[50] In this case, the Court accepts the reasons that prompted the appellant to agree to this arrangement with Mr. Cournoyer, although at times she wanted him to leave. The appellant was initially motivated by economic considerations, and her desire to consider Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s departure became more difficult when Mr. Cournoyer informed Jacob that she wanted him to leave. The Court is of two minds about the appellant\u2019s real reason for tolerating this rental arrangement, at least during the periods and years at issue. In this regard, Mr. Cournoyer seemed categorical about his intentions to pursue the rental arrangement. The appellant\u2019s testimony on this subject was much more nuanced. It suggested that the appellant wanted to end the financial arrangement with Mr. Cournoyer, but Jacob\u2019s involvement complicated things. The Court is more inclined to accept the appellant\u2019s testimony, which in the Court\u2019s view does not corroborate Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s position.\n[51] It is clear to the Court that Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s financial contribution was not directly related to the appellant\u2019s expenses. The expenses that were shared were household expenses and not the appellant\u2019s personal expenses.\n[52] In the circumstances, the Court believes that in this case the economic factor has mixed attributes.\n7. Children\nWhat was the attitude and conduct of the parties concerning children?\n[53] In the case under consideration, the appellant and Mr. Cournoyer are Jacob\u2019s parents. The appellant\u2019s eldest son did not live in the residence on Durocher Street in Gatineau during the periods and years at issue, and Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony did not establish any connection with the appellant\u2019s eldest son. Admittedly, Jacob was mentioned during the testimony at the hearing but the comments focused on the situation of the two adults. However, the fact remains that Jacob helped maintain a bond between his parents.\nVII. Conclusion\n[54] After having considered all the evidence at the hearing, the factors accepted by the courts and weighed each party\u2019s arguments, the Court considers that the appellant has provided sufficiently compelling evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that she was no longer living in a conjugal relationship with Mr. Cournoyer during the periods and taxation years at issue. The testimonial evidence proved to be the key element in this case.\n[55] Some factors support the position that the common-law partnership was maintained after the separation in 2005, but the Court is of the opinion that most of the factors during the taxation periods and years at issue tend to support the recognition that the couple lived separate and apart throughout the periods and years at issue. The Court\u2019s assessment of all of the evidence favours the position supported by the appellant, who, after all, finds herself in a unique situation.\n[56] In Molodowich, affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in M v. H, the Court clarified that the extent to which each of the seven elements listed above will be taken into account must vary with the circumstances of each case. In M v. H, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that the weight to be accorded to the various elements or factors to be considered in determining whether a couple is in a conjugal relationship will vary greatly and almost infinitely. The human race is not static.\n[57] The Court finds the appellant\u2019s testimony more credible and therefore corroborated by Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony in several respects. The appellant\u2019s explanations regarding sensitive elements or that contradict Mr. Cournoyer\u2019s testimony are also more credible and compelling.\n[58] The Court allows the appeals. The redeterminations and reassessments are referred to the Minister of National Revenue for redetermination and reassessment on the following basis:\nCancel the claim for an overpayment determined by the Minister with regard to the 2015, 2016 and 2017 base taxation years in respect of the Canada Child Benefit in the amounts of $247.16, $532.68 and $1,910.53, respectively, on the grounds that the appellant is not living in a common-law partnership.\nSet aside the redetermination regarding the Canada Child Benefit entitlement with respect to the 2018 base taxation year, on the grounds that the appellant is not living in a common-law partnership.\nGrant the wholly dependent person credit that the appellant claimed for her child for each of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years, on the grounds that the appellant is not living in a common-law partnership.\nCancel the gross negligence penalty referred to in subsection 163(2) of ITA, which was assessed with respect to the appellant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of February 2023.\n\u201cJ.

Introduction\n[1] The fundamental issue in these appeals is whether Viviana Reser\u2019s income earned outside of Canada while she and her husband, Clarence Reser, were separated can be used to establish their respective entitlements to the GST credit for payment periods after they reconciled.\n[2] The appeals were heard together on common evidence provided through the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Reser. I found them to be credible and reliable witnesses who did not dispute the key, relevant facts in this matter. As a result, the real dispute between the parties is a legal one, namely the proper interpretation of the GST credit provisions of the Income Tax Act.\n[3] Contrary to the Resers\u2019 position in their appeals, Mrs. Reser\u2019s income as a non-resident was required information pursuant to the relevant definitions and calculations under section 122.5 of the Income Tax Act. Eligibility for the GST credit is based on a taxpayer\u2019s net family income in specific taxation years and Parliament clearly intended for non-resident income to be included in that calculation.\nII. Background \u2013 Change in marital status\n[4] Mr. and Mrs. Reser separated on or around September 1, 2003. The final factor for the breakdown of their relationship was that Mrs. Reser had received an employment offer overseas. Mrs. Reser wanted to go and Mr. Reser did not.\n[5] Mrs. Reser moved to the United Arab Emirates where she was employed full-time teaching English as a second language. She retired in July 2017 and returned to Canada on or around July 27, 2017 to be near her elderly parents in Victoria. She also reconciled with Mr. Reser shortly thereafter.\n[6] In filing their 2017 income tax returns, Mr. and Mrs. Reser reported their marital status as \u201cmarried\u201d. In 2016, Mr. Reser had reported his marital status as \u201cseparated\u201d.\n[7] The Minister of National Revenue initially determined that Mr. Reser was entitled to the GST credit for the payment periods from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 and that Mrs. Reser was entitled to the GST credit for the payment periods from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019.\n[8] The Minister subsequently sought additional information from the Resers, based on their changed marital status. The Minister asked Mr. Reser to disclose his wife\u2019s income outside of Canada in the 2016 taxation year, and asked Mrs. Reser to disclose her income outside of Canada for the beginning of the 2017 taxation year.\n[9] The Resers refused to provide this information to the Minister on the basis that, during that 18-month period, (1) they were separated, and (2) Mrs. Reser was a non-resident whose income was not subject to Canadian tax. The Minister concluded that the Resers\u2019 eligibility for the GST credit could not be calculated without that information and, on August 3, 2018, issued redeterminations reducing the credits already paid to nil.\n[10] The Resers maintain their two-fold position in their appeals from those redeterminations. However, that position runs contrary to the relevant GST credit provisions of the Income Tax Act.\n[11] The Resers understandably had difficulty navigating the application of these somewhat complex provisions. In her oral submissions, counsel for the Respondent effectively summarized how the various definitions and calculations under section 122.5 apply in these appeals. I have included the key provisions in Appendix \u201cA\u201d and will attempt to further simplify them as follows.\n[12] Fundamentally, the GST credit is calculated based on net family income in a prior year, even if a taxpayer was neither married nor resident in Canada during that time.\nIII. Eligibility for the GST credit is based on family income\n[13] Parliament introduced the GST credit to provide some relief to low-income families for GST that they pay. As a result, entitlement to the GST credit is based on a taxpayer\u2019s income.\n[14] To manage the implementation of the credit, a taxpayer\u2019s eligibility is automatically determined based on the income reported in their income tax return for the previous year or two years, sometimes referred to as the \u201cbase years\u201d. [1] The GST credit is calculated based on that prior income, even though it is not paid in either of those years.\n[15] The GST credit is paid quarterly, with respect to specified periods beginning in July, October, January, and April. [2] As a result, a full year of payment periods runs from July 1 of one year to June 30 of the following year.\n[16] If a taxpayer is married, then their eligibility for the GST credit is based on their net family income, i.e., income reported by the taxpayer and their cohabitating spouse. [3]\n[17] In McFadyen, this Court summarized the purpose and rationale for taking into account a taxpayer\u2019s marital status in the calculation as follows: [4]\nThe credit is made available on the basis of family income, in recognition of the fact that much of the spending on the basic necessities of life is done on the basis of the family unit, rather than at the individual level. For this reason, the GST credit is given on a family unit, means-tested basis.\n[18] As a result, taxpayers are required to notify the Minister of changes in their marital status, pursuant to paragraph 122.5(6.1)(b) of the Income Tax Act.\n[19] Using the present case as an example, the Minister used information from Mr. Reser\u2019s 2016 income tax return to initially determine his eligibility for the GST credit for the payment periods beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018. Mr. Reser reported his marital status as \u201cseparated\u201d and income of $18,103.\n[20] The Minister also used the Resers\u2019 2017 income tax returns to initially determine Mrs. Reser\u2019s eligibility for the GST credit for the payment periods beginning July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. Mrs. Reser reported nil income from when she returned as a Canadian resident in July 2017, while Mr. Reser reported earning $18,850 for the full year.\n[21] The calculations under section 122.5 assume that circumstances in a particular taxation year will remain the same in the following two taxation years. [5] However, if there is a change in circumstances, a taxpayer may no longer be eligible for amounts already paid. This is what the Minister attempted to determine in the present case, after Mr. Reser changed his marital status from \u201cseparated\u201d to \u201cmarried\u201d.\n[22] Mr. Reser\u2019s marital status changed effective July 27, 2017. As a result, the Minister needed to redetermine Mr. Reser\u2019s entitlement to the GST credit.\n[23] By operation of the relevant definitions and calculations under section 122.5, the required information included both Mr. and Mrs. Reser\u2019s income in 2016, notwithstanding the fact that they were separated during that taxation year.\n[24] A similar disconnect occurred in the Frenna appeal decided by this Court. [6] Mr. Frenna married in June 2009. His entitlement for the GST credit for the payment periods from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 had initially been calculated based on his 2008 income as a single man. This Court held that his eligibility for the GST credit had to be recalculated to include his spouse\u2019s income from the 2008 taxation year, even though they were not married at that time. [7]\n[25] Mr. Reser\u2019s change in marital status on July 27, 2017 had a similar impact on the calculation of his entitlement to the GST credit. However, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position, it does not impact the calculations for all the payment periods at issue.\nIV. Change in marital status must be \u201cat the beginning\u201d of each of the four specified payment periods\n[26] As stated above, the GST credit is paid quarterly, for specified periods beginning in July, October, January, and April. Considering the date of reconciliation, Mr. Reser\u2019s change in marital status did not occur at the beginning of the specified period commencing July 1, 2017. It only impacts the beginning of the next specified period commencing October 1.\n[27] The definition of \u201cqualified relation\u201d in subsection 122.5(1) refers to a spouse \u201cat the beginning of the specified month\u201d, not \u201cduring\u201d the specified month:\nqualified relation of an individual, in relation to a month specified for a taxation year, means the person, if any, who, at the beginning of the specified month, is the individual\u2019s cohabiting spouse or common-law partner. [emphasis added]\n[28] Eligibility for the GST credit for a particular specified month is based on family circumstances that occurred before the end of the previous specified monthly period. [8]\n[29] As a result, the Resers\u2019 change in marital status at the end of July 2017 only impacted the specified month beginning October 1, 2017. Mrs. Reser\u2019s 2016 income therefore had to be included in the calculation of Mr. Reser\u2019s entitlement for the GST credit for the three payment periods beginning October 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018.\n[30] However, this matter is further complicated by the fact that Mrs. Reser was not resident in Canada in 2016.\nV. Non-resident income is required for the GST credit calculation\n[31] Although the Resers disagree with the application of subsection 122.5(6.2), this provision deems Mrs. Reser\u2019s non-resident income to be part of her income for the year, for the purpose of calculating their respective entitlements for the GST credit:\nNon-residents and part-year residents\n122.5(6.2) For the purpose of this section, the income of a person who is non-resident at any time in a taxation year is deemed to be equal to the amount that would, if the person were resident in Canada throughout the year, be the person\u2019s income for the year.\n[32] The Department of Finance\u2019s Explanatory Note for the provision outlines Parliament\u2019s intention that a taxpayer\u2019s worldwide income must be used in GST credit calculations: [9]\nNew subsection 122.5(6.2) of the Act clarifies that, where a person is not resident in Canada throughout a taxation year, that person's income for the year for the purposes of the GSTC calculations is, for greater certainty, equal to the amount that would have been the person's income for the year had the person been resident in Canada throughout the year.\n[33] As a result, Mrs. Reser\u2019s non-resident income in the 2016 taxation year must be included in the calculation of her husband\u2019s entitlement to the GST credit for the payment periods beginning October 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2018.\n[34] In addition, Mrs. Reser\u2019s non-resident income in the 2017 taxation year must be included in the calculation of her own entitlement to the GST credit for the payment periods beginning July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.\n[35] In support of their position in the appeals, the Resers attempted to rely on general tax principles regarding residency, as well as income amounts determined in separate guaranteed income supplement appeals they previously filed with this Court. [10] However, these general assessing principles and amounts calculated under separate legislation are not relevant to the calculations required for the GST credit. The GST credit provisions in the Income Tax Act clearly outline what amounts are required to calculate a taxpayer\u2019s eligibility for this specific purpose.\nVI. Conclusion \u2013 New GST credit calculations are required\n[36] The Minister reduced the Resers\u2019 GST credits to nil on the basis that they refused to provide information regarding Mrs. Reser\u2019s non-resident income for 2016 and 2017.\n[37] However, during cross-examination, Mrs. Reser estimated that her housing benefits and salary in the United Arab Emirates for 2016 amounted to $90,000. She estimated the same annual amount for 2017, but discounted for part of the year before she returned to Canada in July.\n[38] I accept these amounts, despite counsel for the Respondent\u2019s submission that further information and supporting documents were required. As previously stated, I found Mrs. Reser to be a credible and reliable witness. Counsel for the Respondent did not probe or cast doubt on the estimate Mrs. Reser provided. Counsel should not have asked the question, if she was not willing to accept the answer. [11]\n[39] As a result, the Minister can no longer state that she does not have all the necessary information to calculate the Resers\u2019 net family income for the 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\n[40] I am therefore referring the matters back to the Minister for reconsideration and redetermination of:\n(a) Mr. Reser\u2019s eligibility for the GST credit for the payment periods from October 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, taking into account Mrs. Reser\u2019s 2016 non-resident income of $90,000; and\n(b) Mrs. Reser\u2019s eligibility for the GST credit for the payment periods from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, taking into account her 2017 non-resident income of $45,000. [12]\n[41] In doing so, I do not presuppose that the Resers will be entitled to the GST credit. [13] Rather, this decision is based on my finding that the amounts of Mrs. Reser\u2019s non-resident income are now known and final determinations can be issued to resolve the issues in these appeals.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of February 2023.\n\u201cJoanna Hill\u201d\nHill J.\nAppendix \u201cA\u201d\n122.5(1) definitions for \u201cadjusted income\u201d and \u201cqualified relation\u201d:\nadjusted income, of an individual for a taxation year in relation to a month specified for the taxation year, means the total of the individual\u2019s income for the taxation year and the income for the taxation year of the individual\u2019s qualified relation, if any, in relation to the specified month, both calculated as if in computing that income no amount were\n(a) included\n(i) under paragraph 56(1)(q.1) or subsection 56(6),\n(ii) in respect of any gain from a disposition of property to which section 79 applies, or\n(iii) in respect of a gain described in subsection 40(3.21); or\n(b) deductible under paragraph 20(1)(ww) or 60(y) or (z).\nqualified relation of an individual, in relation to a month specified for a taxation year, means the person, if any, who, at the beginning of the specified month, is the individual\u2019s cohabiting spouse or common-law partner.\nDeemed payment on account of tax\n122.5(3) An eligible individual in relation to a month specified for a taxation year who files a return of income for the taxation year is deemed to have paid during the specified month on account of their tax payable under this Part for the taxation year an amount equal to \u00bc of the amount, if any, determined by the formula\nA - B\nwhere\nA\nis the total of\n(a) $213,\n(b) $213 for the qualified relation, if any, of the individual in relation to the specified month,\n(c) if the individual has no qualified relation in relation to the specified month and is entitled to deduct an amount for the taxation year under subsection 118(1) because of paragraph (b) of the description of B in that subsection in respect of a qualified dependant of the individual in relation to the specified month, $213,\n(d) $112 times the number of qualified dependants of the individual in relation to the specified month, other than a qualified dependant in respect of whom an amount is included under paragraph (c) in computing the total for the specified month,\n(e) if the individual has no qualified relation and has one or more qualified dependants, in relation to the specified month, $112, and\n(f) if the individual has no qualified relation and no qualified dependant, in relation to the specified month, the lesser of $112 and 2% of the amount, if any, by which the individual\u2019s income for the taxation year exceeds $6,911; and\nB\nis 5% of the amount, if any, by which the individual\u2019s adjusted income for the taxation year in relation to the specified month exceeds $27,749.\nMonths specified\n122.5(4) For the purposes of this section, the months specified for a taxation year are July and October of the immediately following taxation year and January and April of the second immediately following taxation year.\nNotification to Minister\n122.5(6.1) An individual shall notify the Minister of the occurrence of any of the following events before the end of the month following the month in which the event occurs:\n(a) the individual ceases to be an eligible individual;\n(b) a person becomes or ceases to be the individual\u2019s qualified relation; and\n(c) a person ceases to be a qualified dependant of the individual, otherwise than because of attaining the age of 19 years.\nNon-residents and part-year residents\n122.5(6.2) For the purpose of this section, the income of a person who is non-resident at any time in a taxation year is deemed to be equal to the amount that would, if the person were resident in Canada throughout the year, be the person\u2019s income for the year.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 22\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-3850(IT)I and 2019-3821(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nVIVIANA RESER & CLARENCE RESER v.

Introduction:\n[1] The appellant, K&D Logging Ltd. (K&D), appeals reassessments of its 2005 and 2006 taxation years, raised by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) August 17, 2017 under the federal Income Tax Act (Act).\n[2] K&D\u2019s appeal focuses on the Minister\u2019s denial of deductions in the amounts of $495,083 (2005 taxation year) and $6,970 (2006 taxation year), claimed by K&D per subsection 20(21) of the Act.\nII. Issue:\n[3] The respondent Crown maintains that both claimed deduction amounts were not deductible but rather, constituted imputed income per subsection 17(1) of the Act.\nIII. Agreed Facts & Evidence:\n[4] The parties submitted a \u201cpartial statement of agreed facts\u201d which included the following agreed facts:\ni. K&D is a resident of Canada and in the logging business;\nii. K&D\u2019s initial shareholders were Kenneth Rasmussen and David Hoy;\niii. David Hoy passed away in 1998;\niv. Interan S.A. (Interan) was not a resident of Canada and was incorporated March 31, 1996 under the laws of Uruguay. Interan was in the business of tree farming, cattle ranching and agriculture, specifically a eucalyptus plantation in Uruguay;\nv. as of September 30, 2004, K&D owned the greatest percentage of Interan of all four Interan shareholders. Interan\u2019s shareholder interest then was 44.41%. K&D\u2019s interest in Interan never exceeded that percentage;\nvi. K&D advanced funds to Interan under an agreement dated May 2, 1996 (Loan; 1996 Loan Agreement);\nvii. the 1996 Loan Agreement was drafted by a lawyer in a Uruguayan law firm, Hughes & Hughes;\nviii. David Hoy negotiated the 1996 Loan Agreement on behalf of K&D;\nix. under the 1996 Loan Agreement:\ni. Interan was the \u201cBorrower\u201d;\nii. K&D, 82301 International Ltd., Fairwinds Holdings Ltd. and Sebalcor S.A. were the \u201cLenders\u201d; and\niii. any payment by Interan insufficient to cover an amount due would be applied in the following order: (1) fees and expenses; (2) overdue payments and interest thereon; (3) interest; and (4) principal;\nx. in the 1996 Loan Agreement the rate of interest was left blank;\nxi. there is no other agreement or correspondence between K&D and Interan that addresses when interest was payable by Interan to K&D re the Loan, other than the 1996 Loan Agreement itself;\nxii. Deloitte LLP prepared K&D\u2019s financial statements and income tax returns for the 1997 to 2006 taxation years based on information provided by K&D\u2019s internal accounting staff;\nxiii. K&D annually reported income with respect to the Loan on its income tax returns for the 1997 to 2005 taxation years as follows: $35,209 (1997); $76,816 (1998); $91,215 (1999); $105,306 (2000); $107,564 (2001); ($46,329) (2002); $46,250 (2003); $37,792 (2004); $41,259 (2005); and $6,970 (2006);\nxiv. in calculating these annual reported amounts DeLoitte LLP used the interest rates prescribed in the Income Tax Regulations;\nxv. K&D reported the reported annual amounts on Schedule 1 of its T2 income tax returns, included in \u201cNet income (loss) after taxes and extraordinary items per financial statements\u201d;\nxvi. K&D booked the amounts as interest receivable in its books and records;\nxvii. Deloitte LLP prepared a summary of the total interest and principal receivable from Interan in relation to the Loan. That summary was based on information provided by K&D\u2019s internal accounting staff. The amounts of interest indicated in the summary are the same as the annual reported amounts, calculated using the prescribed rates;\nxviii. Deloitte LLP used the balances from its summary in preparing K&D\u2019s financial statements;\nxix. K&D\u2019s directors approved its income tax return for each year;\nxx. in 2005, K&D determined that the total amount booked as interest receivable of $495,083 on the Loan would not be received and as such it was written-off as a bad debt;\nxxi. in 2006, K&D determined that a further amount of $6,970 that was booked as interest receivable would not be received;\nxxii. as of December 31, 2005 the total amount of principal outstanding on the Loan was $1,628,173;\nxxiii. on or about February 23, 2006, K&D received a payment of $1,350,651 from Interan in repayment of the outstanding balance of the Loan.\n[5] At the hearing K&D called the two witnesses who testified. They were Ben Hoy (son of David Hoy), president of K&D since 2003, and retired DeLoitte LLP accountant Charles Buchan, who on behalf of his firm had advised K&D\u2019s shareholders from K&D\u2019s 1972 incorporation until his retirement in 2006, and thereafter until 2015 as a DeLoitte consultant.\n[6] Mr. Buchan testified that in or about April and May 1996 [1] the then K&D shareholders, Messrs. D. Hoy and Rasmussen, had travelled to Uruguay to look into potential K&D involvement with Interan.\n[7] Both witnesses testified that only in 2009 had they become aware of the 1996 Loan Agreement itself, which showed that the Loan (which of course they were aware of) had not borne interest given its blank space for entry of any rate of interest.\n[8] Mr. Buchan was asked if he had asked Mr. D. Hoy before his death in 1998 if a written agreement existed pertaining to the Loan. Mr. Buchan responded, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t recall whether I did or didn\u2019t, I\u2019m uncertain\u2026 I\u2019m trying to be honest with you, I don\u2019t recall whether I asked or not. I would expect if he had one he would have given it.\u201d [2]\n[9] Mr. Buchan testified that in 1996, in speaking with Mr. D. Hoy (who on behalf of K&D had negotiated the terms of the Loan and signed the 1996 Loan Agreement) about the Loan, he (Mr. Buchan), \u201csuggest[ed] that we consider charging interest because the only security for any of the loans down there were the underlying assets\u201d. [3]\n[10] Mr. Buchan testified also that he, \u201c\u2026had a concern about the fact, well, was this an outlay or an income for tax purposes? Because if we just show the advances without any interest being earned on it and it went bad, would we have a problem getting a write-off?\u201d [4]\n[11] In his direct examination Mr. Buchan was asked what interest rate K&D applied to the Loan. He answered:\n\u2026that was a difficult scenario because in hindsight there was no interest indicated, but the fact was that we had to determine something in \u201996. So, what we had done is we went to past history, because if you go back to \u201996 there are loans to shareholders and a related company of K&D, and we charged interest on those loans. These were amounts they paid, and we used the prescribed rate under the Income Tax Act. So I said to David [Hoy] it would be fair if we looked at charging the same rate on the monies that we advanced to Interan, and he didn\u2019t disagree with that. He said that was fine. [5] (underlining added)\n[12] In cross-examination Mr. Buchan further testified:\n\u2026Interan was a new venture. We didn\u2019t know at the time we looked at it who those parties were, whereas in here we would know [who] these parties were. So, basically what we looked at is what history did we have in charging interest? Probably could have been an argument the interest rates should have been far higher then the prescribed rate because of the risk factor. But we didn\u2019t do that, because historically what we had done before in situations that were similar, we had charged the prescribed rate.\nSo, that\u2019s why we had a rate. We could have said it was nil. But why would we do that? We had no security for the loan, we wanted to look at the tax issues that would have arisen if it became a bad debt, and so we decided what history did we have in charging the prescribed rate, and then we went back and looked at these loans where we had it. Like you say, some are prescribed, and some are not, but that\u2019s the history that we had. We had really not a lot of comparisons, let's put it that way.\nQ. So because you hadn\u2019t seen the agreement, you guessed, an educated guess at what the interest rate should be.\nWell that\u2019s an interesting question you\u2019re asking because we didn\u2019t guess anything. What we decided to do at the time, because we didn\u2019t know what the contents - we didn\u2019t know there was a loan agreement, to be honest with you, at the time. We are talking about \u201896 now, not the loan agreement that was drafted on [May] the 2nd, because we never saw that agreement. We just said given the risk factors of this loan, we should be charging interest, because if we don\u2019t and it goes bad, [is] the CRA going to come back and say, \u201cWell you never had an outlay to earn income with no expectation of profit.\u201d That\u2019s really what pushed us. [6] (underlining added)\n[13] Further to the 1996 Buchan\/D. Hoy discussion that Mr. Buchan spoke of wherein they agreed that K&D would charge Interan interest using prescribed rates, there is no evidence that K&D at any subsequent time obtained or sought Interan agreement that the Loan bear interest, at any rate.\n[14] As well there is no evidence that K&D ever sought to notify Interan that, at least in K&D\u2019s view, Interan owed interest to K&D.\n[15] On July 11, 2009, in the course of a Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) audit of K&D\u2019s 2005 and 2006 taxation years, Mr. Buchan communicated with Interan\u2019s Uruguayan lawyers regarding the Loan. In reply the lawyers sent him a copy of the 1996 Loan Agreement, that Mr. Buchan testified he had never seen before. As noted above, it showed that interest was not payable on the Loan.\n[16] As stated in K&D\u2019s counsel\u2019s written submissions, because there was no interest rate indicated in the 1996 Loan Agreement and Interan had never paid any interest, Mr. Buchan \u201cwas of the view that the interest had been included in the income of the Appellant [K&D] in error.\u201d [7]\n[17] The Minister, now aware of the 1996 Loan Agreement, on August 14, 2009 reassessed K&D\u2019s 2005 and 2006 taxation years, denying the claimed deductions - $495,083 (2005) and $6,970 (2006). This was as the 1996 Loan Agreement, reflecting that the Loan was interest free, thus provided no basis for K&D booking receivable interest. Consequently, in light of the Loan not bearing interest, the Minister re-calculated imputed income to be reported per subsection 17(1).\n[18] K&D served notices of objection respecting these August 14, 2009 reassessments. In response, on August 17, 2017 the Minister further reassessed K&D\u2019s 2005 and 2006 taxation years, confirming denial of the two claimed deductions. As noted, these reassessments now are before the Court.\nIV. Analysis:\n[19] The question is whether the two amounts K&D claimed as deductions ($495,083 (2005)) and $6,970 (2006)) are deductible, given that the Loan was interest free.\n[20] Mr. Buchan testified that in 2009 he and K&D became aware of the 1996 Loan Agreement, which showed that the Loan, originating in 1996 and closed in 2006, did not bear interest.\n[21] The reassessments of the 2005 and 2006 taxation years that are appealed reflect the reality that the Loan was interest free.\n[22] The respondent Crown pleaded in its Reply (para. 13):\n13. The Attorney General of Canada submits that [K&P] was not entitled to deductions of $495,083 and $6,970 for the 2005 and 2006 taxation years, respectively, on the disposition of a debt obligation under subsection 20(21) of the Act, because there was no interest payable on the [1996 Loan] Agreement. More specifically, [K&P] did not include in income for the 2006 taxation year or any preceding taxation year interest payable on the [1996 Loan] Agreement, but rather, reported an amount of no more than $502,053 in order to comply with subsection 17(1) of the Act. As the amount reported under subsection 17(1) is not itself an amount of accrued interest, there are no amounts that were included in computing [K&P\u2019s] income for the 2006 and preceding taxation years as interest in respect of the [1996 Loan] Agreement. (underlining added)\n[23] The respondent Crown maintains that because the Loan was interest free, K&D was wrong to have annually booked \u201creceivable interest\u201d and report income on that basis. It is understood that K&D does not refute this.\n[24] The respondent further maintains that with the Loan not bearing interest, subsection 17(1) required K&D to have annually reported imputed income calculated at prescribed rates, which imputed income would not be deductible whether pursuant to subsection 20(21) or otherwise.\nSubsection 17(1):\n[25] Subsection 17(1) has existed in various iterations since 1934. [8] Set out below in relevant part are the two versions respectively in force during K&D\u2019s 1997 and 1998 taxation years, and during K&D\u2019s 1999 through 2006 taxation years.\n17(1) version in force during K&D\u2019s 1997 and 1998 taxation years:\n17(1) Amount owing by non-resident [deemed interest income] If this subsection applies to a corporation resident in Canada in respect of an amount owing to the corporation (in this subsection referred to as the \u201cdebt\u201d), the corporation shall include in computing its income for a taxation year the amount determined by the formula;\nA-B\nWhere A is the amount of interest that would be included in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year in respect of the debt if interest on the debt were computed at the prescribed rate for the period in the year during which the debt was outstanding; and\nB is the total of all amounts each of which is\n(a) an amount included in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year as, on account of, in lieu of or in satisfaction of interest in respect of the debt\u2026\n17(1) version in force during K&D\u2019s 1999 through 2006 taxation years:\n17. (1) Where, at any time in a taxation year of a corporation resident in Canada, a non-resident person owes an amount to the corporation, that amount has been or remains outstanding for more than a year and the total determined under paragraph (b) for the year is less than the amount of interest that would be included in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year in respect of the amount owing if that interest were computed at a reasonable rate for the period in the year during which the amount was owing, the corporation shall include an amount in computing its income for the year equal to the amount, if any, by which\n(a) the amount of interest that would be included in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year in respect of the amount owing if that interest were computed at the prescribed rate for the period in the year during which the amount was owing exceeds\n(b) the total of all amounts each of which is\n(i) an amount included in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year as, on account of, in lieu of or in satisfaction of, interest in respect of the amount owing\u2026\n[26] The above version of subsection 17(1), in force during K&D\u2019s 1999 through 2006 taxation years, requires simply that the imputed \u201camount\u201d be reported as income. In the above subsection 17(1) version in force during K&D\u2019s 1997 and 1998 taxation years, the imputed amount was deemed to be interest, and reportable as interest income.\n[27] In general, subsection 17(1) applies where an amount owed by a non\u2011resident person (e.g. Interan) to a Canadian resident corporation (e.g. K&D) bears no or unreasonably low interest, and that owed amount has been outstanding for more than a year (e.g., the Loan, commenced in 1996).\n[28] In 1970 the Tax Appeal Board described the general purpose of the then version of subsection 17(1):\nThis section is aimed at preventing a corporation that is resident in Canada and therefore taxable therein from using its capital abroad by means of non-interest-bearing loans in order to avoid our income tax on profits to be gained thereby. [9]\n[29] In 1999, G. Watson and S. Baum similarly specified the purpose of the then version of subsection 17(1):\n\u2026section 17 is a specialized transfer-pricing and income imputation provision that, together with, and in some cases potentially overlapping, the FAPI regime and the shareholder loan rules in subsection 15(2), is intended to prevent corporate taxpayers from issuing interest-free or low-interest loans to non-residents to reduce Canadian income tax. [10] (underlining added)\n[30] With respect to the subsection 17(1) version applying to K&D for its 1999 through 2006 taxation years, the imputed income to be reported is, \u201c\u2026equal to the excess of the interest on the amount owing, computed using the prescribed rate under the Act, over the amount included in income under paragraph 17(1)(b).\u201d [11]\n[31] In this case the Loan bore no interest. Therefore, properly, there could not have been any \u201creceivable interest\u201d that K&D had annually booked and reported as income.\n[32] Thus per subparagraph 17(1)(b)(i), there correctly was no, \u201cinterest in respect of the amount owing\u201d. Therefore there could not have been any amounts of added income, referenced as booked receivable interest or otherwise, as being, \u201c\u2026on account of, in lieu of or in satisfaction of interest in respect of the amount owing\u201d. [12] Properly there would be a paragraph 17(1)(b) amount of nil to subtract from the paragraph 17(1)(a) amount being the amount owed, multiplied by the pertinent prescribed rate. That would leave the paragraph 17(1)(a) amount itself as the imputed amount to be claimed as income for each of the taxation years, from 1999 to 2006 inclusive. The same would be so for the prior version of subsection 17(1), except that the resulting imputed amount to be added as income would be deemed to be interest.\n[33] As reflected in testimony above set out, K&D took Mr. Buchan\u2019s advice to charge the prescribed rate as interest on the Loan, which was booked as \u201creceivable interest\u201d and reported as income. Although, nothing was done to obtain Interan\u2019s agreement to actually make the charging of such interest a term of the Loan.\n[34] Thus the amounts K&D wrongly had reported as income on account of \u201creceivable interest\u201d from 1997 to 2006, equates with the annual amount of imputed income that per subsection 17(1) should have been reported. That is because subsection 17(1) requires use of the prescribed rate while at the same time K&D selected the prescribed rate to apply in calculating its amount of annual income referable to the fictional \u201creceivable interest\u201d.\n[35] In other words, K&D annually reported the correct income in relation to the Loan, albeit on the wrong basis - i.e., as booked receivable interest, rather than imputed income per subsection 17(1), in recognition that the Loan was interest free. And, these annually reported income amounts total the amounts of $495,083 (2005) and $6,970 (2006), that K&D claims as being deductible.\n[36] K&D argues that the annual amounts it booked as receivable interest, although wrongly as the Loan was interest-free, nevertheless should be recognized as receivable interest for purposes of the subsection 17(1) calculation of imputed income. After all that is what was booked.\n[37] I do not concur. That would bring the result of the subsection 17(1) calculation of imputed income to be nil, relying on delayed awareness that the Loan was interest-free. This would fly in the face of the above-noted purpose of subsection 17(1), being to impute income in respect of Canadian corporations that have made interest free or unreasonably low interest loans to non-residents that remained place for more than a year. Here, the Loan was interest-free, made to a non-resident person by a Canadian corporation. The imputed income cannot be nil if subsection 17(1) is to mean anything.\n[38] Parliament undoubtedly intended that an amount reported as being \u201creceivable interest\u201d actually be receivable interest. Fictional amounts cannot be condoned. This is particularly so in light of the transfer-pricing purpose that subsection 17(1) served.\n[39] K&D submits that if section 17 applies, the 1996 Federal Court Trial Division reconsidered decision of Liampat Holdings Ltd. v. R., 96 D.T.C. 6044, 109 F.T.R. 43 (FCTD), supports that the imputed interest deemed received (per the above older version of subsection 17(1) set out above) would be deductible. In Liampat the particular loan agreement provided that interest be paid, \u201cat a reasonable rate\u201d when the borrower could afford to pay or was wound up. In fact no interest was received.\n[40] The appellant K&D posits in its written submissions (p. 3) that the present case and Liampat are alike insofar as, \u201cinterest may have been payable at some stage\u201d. Of course in Liampat that is true, given its particular interest provision. As for the Loan in the present case K&D references the fact that in the 1996 Loan Agreement a provision for rate of interest was left blank. But K&D refers to no evidence providing any basis for speculation that this provision might ever be re-visited. Indeed, the very existence of the 1996 Loan Agreement supposedly was unknown to K&D and Mr. Buchan during the entire 1996 \u2013 2006 life of the Loan, and until 2009.\n[41] Accordingly I find Liampat not applicable to the present case. With the Loan bearing nil interest, subsection 17(1) is applicable, entirely in line with its above-noted transfer-pricing purpose.\n[42] By recognizing in this matter the non-existence of \u201creceivable interest\u201d, by operation of law the correctly calculated amount of imputed income per subsection 17(1) applies. On these facts the correct amounts of imputed per subsection 17(1) perfectly correspond with the amounts annually reported in respect of the Loan and wrongly claimed to be in respect of \u201creceivable interest\u201d.\n[43] Thus the true legal nature of each of the two amounts in issue being $495,083 (2005) and $6,970 (2006) is that the first is an aggregate amount of properly calculated imputed income for the years 1997 through 2005, per subsection 17(1). The second is the properly calculated imputed income amount for the 2006 taxation year.\n[44] Further, how could Parliament contemplate the quantum of \u201cinterest in respect of the amount owing\u201d for a non-interest bearing loan as being anything but nil\/zero. To suggest that Parliament does not care if amounts reported as income do not actually pertain to, \u201cinterest in respect of the debt\/amount owing\u201d, opens the door to basically any figure being so identified and reported. Such would fatally flaw subsection 17(1)\u2019s ability to effect its transfer-pricing purpose.\n[45] The fact that it was only in 2009, well after the relevant 1997 \u2013 2006 period, that the appellant K&D is said to have ascertained (in the course of a CRA audit) the true fact that the Loan was interest free, should not assist K&D in its denial of the reassessments at issue. Those reassessments reflect calculation of subsection 17(1) imputed income for each pertinent taxation year on the basis of that true fact that the Loan was interest free. That is entirely appropriate. A fundamental role of reassessments under the Act is to supersede prior assessments\/reassessments founded on wrong facts.\n[46] That K&D may well have had subsection 17(1) in mind all along is supported by several facts: (i) Mr. Buchan was well aware of subsection 17(1) as confirmed in a 1998 letter he wrote to another accountant; [13] ii) the annual reported amounts were exactly those amounts as would be calculated as imputed income by subsection 17(1) in recognizing the Loan to be interest free; and (3) no \u201creceivable interest\u201d was reported for the 1996 taxation year in which year the Loan was made. Rather, such reporting was only commenced with the 1997 taxation year. That is consistent with the subsection 17(1) proviso that it only begins to apply where the particular debt has been outstanding for more than a year.\n[47] In any event it is not for taxpayers but rather for the Act itself to determine the tax charging provisions that apply, in light of a factually accurate and relevant context.\n[48] I find in this appeal that properly subsection 17(1) has application, on the factually accurate basis of the Loan at al times having been interest free.\nSubsection 20(21):\n[49] I also address subsection 20(21) of the Act. K&D argues that the sought deductions should be allowed per that provision, which reads in relevant part:\n20(21) [Deduction on disposition of] Debt obligation If a taxpayer has in a particular taxation year disposed of a property that is an interest in, or for civil law a right in, a debt obligation for consideration equal to its fair market value at the time of disposition, there may be deducted in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the particular year the amount, if any, by which\n(a) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that was included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the particular year or a preceding taxation year as interest in respect of that property exceeds the total of all amounts each of which is\n(b) the portion of an amount that was received or became receivable by the taxpayer in the particular year or a preceding taxation year that can reasonably be considered to be in respect of an amount described in paragraph 20(21) (a) and that was not repaid by the taxpayer to the issuer of the debt obligation because of an adjustment in respect of interest received before the time of disposition by the taxpayer, or\n(c) an amount in respect of that property that was deductible by the taxpayer by virtue of paragraph 20(14)(b) in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the particular year of a preceding taxation year.\n[50] Subsection 20(21) permits a lender taxpayer to deduct for interest to the extent a debt obligation is subsequently disposed of at fair market value without recovery of interest that the taxpayer has previously reported (e.g., accrued, received, receivable) as income.\n[51] K&D states that it remains entitled to the claimed deductions because per the language of paragraph 20(21)(a), the claimed deductions are constituted of \u201camounts each of which is an amount that was included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the particular year or a preceding taxation year as interest in respect of that property [i.e., debt obligation]\u201d.\n[52] K&D says it does not matter that in reality there was no \u201cinterest in respect of that property\u201d, such that the annual income inclusions based on supposed \u201creceivable interest\u201d were wrong.\n[53] I consider that subsection 20(21) has no application. As concluded above, subsection 17(1) applies, in the context of accurate facts, resulting in the annual reported amounts being imputed income amounts per subsection 17(1).\n[54] Subsection 20(21) cannot apply where subsection 17(1) does. Allowing a subsection 20(21) deduction for reported income on the basis of fictional receivable interest would completely nullify the intended purpose and effect of subsection 17(1). It would leave the appellant in a better place than if the true situation of the Loan being non-interest bearing had governed from the start. Lack of candour would be encouraged.\n[55] The appellant cites Cohen v. Minister of National Revenue, 1988 CarswellNat 405, [1988] 2 C.T.C. 2021, 88 D.T.C. 1404 (T.C.C.), in respect of subsection 20(21). In this 1988 decision this Court determined that an amount erroneously reported as interest by the taxpayer should be included in computing a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to a subsection 20(21) deduction.\n[56] The difference however is that, unlike in Cohen, here there is a counterpart tax liability provision, being subsection 17(1), that should operate to the extent erroneously claimed interest income is recognized. In the result the reported income remains, but as imputed subsection 17(1) income.\n[57] Thus, Cohen cannot extend to this case, wherein the calculated amount of subsection 17(1) imputed income increases dollar for dollar to the extent the amount of income based on bogus claimed receivable interest is reduced or eliminated.\n[58] Additionally, K&D counsel in his oral submissions stated, \u201c\u2026the appellant is not arguing that subsection 20(21) applies where income is included under section 17.\u201d [14] Thus I do not believe there is an issue here as between the parties.\n[59] One might ask why K&D seemed intent on booking receivable interest in the first place. The answer appears to be Mr. Buchan\u2019s above-noted concern that if the Loan went bad, without a provision for interest there could be \u201ca problem getting a write-off\u201d.\nAlternatively, Interest was Receivable and Received:\n[60] I concur with the respondent\u2019s alternative argument that, assuming interest was payable by Interan, there remains no entitlement to a subsection 20(21) deduction, as K&D received full payment of any interest due when on February 23, 2006 it received Interan\u2019s partial repayment of $1,350,561, being 83% repayment of the $1,628,173 outstanding balance of the Loan.\n[61] Section 6.3 of the 1996 Loan Agreement provides for an ordered allocation of funds where the overall payment is less than the full outstanding balance. As stated above, any payment by Interan insufficient to cover an amount due would be applied in the following order: (i) fees and expenses; (ii) overdue payments and interest thereon; (iii) interest; and (iv) principal.\n[62] This ordering provides that interest is to be satisfied in priority to principal. It is not disputed that in accordance with the above ordering the $1,350,561 partial repayment of the outstanding total of $1,628,173 would cover all asserted overdue interest in the aforementioned amounts of $495,083 and $6,970, totaling $502,053. Accordingly (again on the assumption that any interest was ever due), there would be no remaining interest due, of which for K&D to seek deduction.\n[63] On the basis of the foregoing, the appeal will be denied, with costs.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia this 23rd day of February 2023.\n\u201cB.

OVERVIEW\nA. Assessments\n[1] 1048547 Ontario Inc (\u201cOpco\u201d) operates a business named \u201cSkotidakis Goat Farm\u201d that manufactures dairy products, including cheese and yogurt. The manufacturing facility, which is located in Saint-Eug\u00e8ne, Ontario, is 150,000 square feet. Opco buys local milk in Canada and in the United States and purchases cheeses and various equipment in Europe. Products manufactured by Opco are sold throughout North America, including Mexico. Opco\u2019s clients are located in North America. Sales revenue increased steadily over the years, and in 2022, this revenue was approximately 200 million dollars. Currently, Opco has approximately 300 employees.\n[2] For the taxation year ended December 31, 2015, the Minister of National Revenue (\u201cthe Minister\u201d) reassessed Opco under the Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp), as amended (\u201cITA\u201d), to disallow the deduction of various expenses totalling $496,297 and to allow additional expenses totalling $830,452 in the computation of Opco\u2019s business income.\n[3] Disallowed expenses consisted of licence fees (\u201cLicence Fees\u201d) totalling $141,653 and travel expenses (I will refer to the travel expenses, which include meals and other expenses, as \u201ctravel expenses\u201d in these reasons) of various members of the Skotidakis family totalling $354,644. Disallowed Licence Fees consisted of a penalty in the amount of $99,111 for the late remittance of payroll deductions. At the hearing, Opco conceded that the amount of $99,111, consisting of a late\u2011remittance penalty for payroll deductions, was not deductible in the computation of its business income. However, the balance of Licence Fees, amounting to $42,542, remains at issue.\n[4] For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the Minister reassessed John Skotidakis (\u201cJohn\u201d), the President of Opco, to include in the computation of his income $211,621 and $156,696, respectively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA. These amounts represent part of the travel expenses, paid by Opco, of John, his spouse Peggy and his mother Maria, the deduction of which was disallowed in the computation of Opco\u2019s business income.\n[5] For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the Minister reassessed Antigoni Skotidakis (\u201cAntigoni\u201d), the Treasurer and Human Resources Director of Opco, to include in the computation of her income $237,647 and $181,737, respectively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA. These amounts represent part of the travel expenses, paid by Opco, of Antigoni, her spouse Kyriakos and her mother Maria, the deduction of which was disallowed in the computation of Opco\u2019s business income.\n[6] For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the Minister reassessed Kostantina Skotidakis (\u201cKostantina\u201d) to include in the computation of her income $6,967 and $19,624, respectively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA. These amounts represent part of the travel expenses of Kostantina, paid by Opco, the deduction of which was disallowed in the computation of Opco\u2019s business income. At the hearing, the Respondent took the view that benefits conferred on Kostantina should be included in her income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA. As an alternative position, the Respondent took the view that benefits were conferred on Kostantina under subsection 15(1) of the ITA, or as a further alternative, under subsection 246(1) of the ITA.\n[7] For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the Minister reassessed Kostantinos Skotidakis (\u201cKostantinos\u201d), the Vice-President of Opco, to include in the computation of his income $29,049 and $18,549, respectively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA. These amounts represent part of the travel expenses of Kostantinos, paid by Opco, the deduction of which was disallowed in the computation of Opco\u2019s business income. At the hearing, the Respondent took the view that benefits conferred on Kostantinos should be included in his income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA. As an alternative position, the Respondent took the view that benefits were conferred on Kostantinos under subsection 15(1) of the ITA, or as a further alternative, under subsection 246(1) of the ITA\n[8] John, Antigoni, Kostantina and Kostantinos are siblings (I will refer to them as the \u201cSiblings\u201d in these reasons). At the hearing, of the four Siblings, only John testified. Ms. Jos\u00e9e Myre (Opco\u2019s Financial Controller), Mr. Ralph Nahas (a tax specialist and consultant for the Skotidakis group), Chun-Xiang Bao (a chartered professional accountant), and the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) auditor who performed the Appellants\u2019 audits, Ms. Hua Lu, also testified.\nB. Procedural History\n[9] The five appeals were heard on common evidence on November 22 and November 28, 2022.\n[10] By letter dated November 16, 2022, which was three business days before the scheduled hearing of the appeals, Michel Jasmin (who was not at that time counsel of record for any of the Appellants) requested an adjournment of the hearing, alleging that he would not be able to prepare adequately for it.\n[11] On November 18, 2022, which was one business day before the scheduled hearing of the appeals, counsel of record for the Appellants in appeals 2019\u20112464(IT)G, 2019-2463(IT)G and 2019-2458(IT)G, Robert Fragasso, filed a motion to cease to act for ethical reasons and on the basis of a breakdown of the relationship between counsel and clients. On that same day, Mr. Jasmin filed another request for adjournment, alleging that he would not be able to prepare adequately for the hearing because he was involved in another hearing. Also on the same day, the Court denied Mr. Jasmin\u2019s adjournment request.\n[12] On November 21, 2022, which was the day before the scheduled hearing of the appeals, Mr. Jasmin filed with the Court a document entitled [translation] \u201cnotification of representation by counsel\u201d. On that same day, Mr. Fragasso withdrew his motion to cease to act as Mr. Jasmin was now counsel of record for the Appellants in appeals 2019-2464(IT)G, 2019-2463(IT)G and 2019-2458(IT)G.\n[13] At the beginning of the hearing on November 22, 2022, Mr. Jasmin did not request an adjournment of the hearing but proposed that the Court adjourn the hearing. According to Mr. Jasmin, since at least two days were required for the completion of the hearing of the appeals, it would be easier to proceed later, when the Court was available for two consecutive days. However, Mr. Jasmin stated that he was ready to proceed. Counsel for the Respondent did not agree with the proposition that the hearing be adjourned to another day.\n[14] Given the fact that the reasons raised by Mr. Jasmin were not sufficient for the Court to agree with Mr. Jasmin\u2019s proposal to adjourn the hearing, the appeals were heard on November 22, 2022, which was the day fixed for the hearing of the five appeals by orders issued by the Court at the beginning of May 2021. It is to be noted that the Appellants did not file any documentary evidence at the hearing on November 22, 2022, nor when the hearing was continued on November 28, 2022. However, the Respondent filed a book of documents (exhibits R-1 to R-19).\nII. ISSUES\n[15] These appeals raise the following issues:\n(i) For the taxation year ended December 31, 2015, and given the concession made by Opco at the hearing that Licence Fees of $99,111 for the late remittance penalty for payroll deductions were not deductible in computing Opco\u2019s business income, is Opco entitled to claim additional deductions totalling $397,186 (composed of travel expenses totalling $354,644 and Licence Fees totalling $42,542) in the computation of its business income?\n(ii) For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, should amounts totalling $211,621 and $156,696, respectively, be included in the computation of John\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, alternatively, as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA?\n(iii) For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, should amounts totalling $237,647 and $181,737, respectively, be included in the computation of Antigoni\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, alternatively, as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA?\n(iv) For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, should amounts totalling $6,967 and $19,624, respectively, be included in the computation of Kostantina\u2019s income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA or, alternatively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or as benefits under subsection 246(1) of the ITA?\n(v) For the 2014 and 2015 taxation years, should amounts totalling $29,049 and $18,549, respectively, be included in the computation of Kostantinos\u2019s income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA or, alternatively, as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or as benefits under subsection 246(1) of the ITA?\nIII. CONCLUSION\n[16] For the following reasons, and given the concessions made by Opco at the beginning of the hearing that the Licence Fees amounting to $99,111 were not deductible in the computation of its business income:\n(i) the appeals of the reassessments made under the ITA for the 2014 and 2015 taxation years of John (docket number 2019-2463(IT)G) and Antigoni (docket number 2019-2464(IT)G) and the appeal of the reassessment made under the ITA for Opco for the taxation year ended December 31, 2015 (docket number 2019-2458(IT)G) are dismissed, with one set of costs in favour of the Respondent; and\n(ii) the appeals of the reassessments made under the ITA for the 2014 and 2015 taxation years of Kostantina (docket number 2019\u20112467(IT)I) and Kostantinos (docket number 2019-2460(IT)I) are dismissed, without costs.\nIV. OTHER RELEVANT FACTS\n[17] Another corporation, which I will refer to as Holdco, owns all the issued and outstanding participating shares of the share capital of Opco. All the issued and outstanding non-participating shares of the share capital of Opco are owned equally by John and Antigoni.\n[18] John and Antigoni own all the non-participating shares of the share capital of Holdco, while all the issued and outstanding participating shares of the share capital of Holdco are owned as follows: John (36%), Antigoni (20%), Kostantina (20%) and Kostantinos (24%).\n[19] John, Antigoni, Kostantina and Kostantinos are all employees of Opco. More particularly, John is the President of Opco and is the main person involved in business development. As part of his duties with Opco, he travels a lot. Antigoni is responsible for human resources. She hires new employees and deals with all other matters relating to human resources. Kostantinos is Opco\u2019s Vice-President. Kyriakos, Antigoni\u2019s spouse, is Opco\u2019s Plant Manager. No evidence was adduced at the hearing as to the duties performed by Kostantina in Opco.\n[20] Finally, the evidence showed that Maria and Peggy are not employees of Opco.\nV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nA. The Appellants\n[21] According to the Appellants, they met their burden of establishing that the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact in making the reassessments at issue were wrong. The CRA auditor\u2019s testimony was vague, hesitant and showed that she did not understand the facts. It is clear that various expenses were accounted for twice. John\u2019s testimony was clear and transparent. All travel expenses paid by Opco were incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing business income, namely to meet suppliers worldwide or to develop Opco\u2019s business market. The travel expenses were not of a personal nature for John, Antigoni, Kostantina or Kostantinos and should not have been included in the computation of their income under the ITA.\n[22] Furthermore, expenses not supported by any documents or credit card statements should not have been included in the computation of John\u2019s and Antigoni\u2019s income as suggested by Ms. Myre, since neither John nor Antigoni was made aware of that discussion with Ms. Myre and the CRA auditor.\n[23] Finally, according to the Appellants, subsection 15(1) of the ITA does not apply to a shareholder who owns only non-participating shares. As neither John nor Antigoni owns participating shares in Opco, they should not be assessed a benefit under subsection 15(1) of the ITA.\nB. The Respondent\n[24] The Respondent\u2019s position is as follows:\n(i) In respect of Opco:\n(ii) In respect of John:\n\u00b7 the disallowed travel expenses were not incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing income from Opco\u2019s business and were properly disallowed under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA; and\n\u00b7 the amount of $42,542, consisting of Licence Fees, was never paid by Opco and hence was not incurred by Opco for business purposes and was properly disallowed under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA.\nOpco paid for personal travel expenses for John, his spouse (Peggy) and his mother (Maria). The travel expenses were never repaid to Opco and were never included in John\u2019s income and therefore these amounts should be included in John\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, alternatively, as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA.\n(iii) In respect of Antigoni:\n(iv) In respect of Kostantina:\n\u00b7 Opco paid for personal travel expenses for Antigoni, her spouse (Kyriakos) and her mother (Maria). The travel expenses were never repaid to Opco and were never included in Antigoni\u2019s income and therefore these amounts should be included in Antigoni\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, alternatively, as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA.\nOpco paid for personal travel expenses for Kostantina, and these expenses were never repaid to Opco and were never included in Kostantina\u2019s income. Therefore, these amounts should be included in Kostantina\u2019s income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA. Alternatively, these amounts should be included in Kostantina\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, otherwise, as benefits under subsection 246(1) of the ITA.\n(v) In respect of Kostantinos:\nOpco paid for personal travel expenses for Kostantinos, and these expenses were never repaid to Opco and were never included in Kostantinos\u2019s income. Therefore, these amounts should be included in Kostantinos\u2019s income as employee benefits under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA. Alternatively, these amounts should be included in Kostantinos\u2019s income as shareholder benefits under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or, otherwise, as benefits under subsection 246(1) of the ITA.\n[25] The Appellants did not meet their burden of showing the Court that the disallowed travel expenses were incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing income from Opco\u2019s business. Furthermore, the Appellants did not meet their burden of showing that the Licence Fees were paid by Opco.\n[26] On the one hand, Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony at the hearing was clear and reliable; also, the working papers filed as exhibits R-8, R-9, R-10, R-11, R-12, R\u201113, R\u201114, R-15, R-16, R\u201117, R-18, and R-19 are consistent with her testimony.\n[27] On the other hand, Ms. Myre\u2019s testimony was vague and inconsistent with Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony, and lacked credibility. During the taxation years under appeal, Ms. Myre was Opco\u2019s Financial Controller. In her testimony, she was hesitant and did not remember what was said during the meetings that she had with the auditor. Since she was assigned to deal with the audit, it is not credible that, as Opco\u2019s Financial Controller, she did not know which expenses were personal and which expenses were business-related.\n[28] Furthermore, John\u2019s testimony was not credible when he testified that all disallowed travel expenses paid by Opco were incurred for business purposes. He did not provide any reasonable explanation nor any documentary evidence to justify the deduction of the expenses for Opco. He only made a bold statement that all the disallowed travel expenses were incurred for business purposes.\n[29] Finally, the Respondent asks the Court to draw two adverse inferences. Firstly, since Antigoni, Kostantina and Kostantinos did not come to testify at the hearing, an inference should be drawn that their testimony would have shown that the disallowed travel expenses were personal in nature and not business\u2011related. Secondly, because the Appellants did not submit any receipts or other documentary evidence to support the nature of the travel expenses at issue, an inference should be drawn that the receipts would have shown that the expenses were personal in nature and not incurred for business purposes.\nVI. DISCUSSION\nA. Preliminary Issue: Jurisdiction of the Court\n[30] In his testimony, John stated that after the audit, Opco decided not to challenge the disallowance of the deduction of the various travel expenses at issue. John also stated that he was not made aware at any time during the audit that the expenses so disallowed would be included in the computation of his income or the income of his siblings. According to John, he and his siblings should have been made aware of the tax consequences resulting from the disallowance of the deduction of the travel expenses in computing Opco\u2019s business income, but the CRA auditor failed to inform them of these consequences.\n[31] However, whether the CRA auditor had informed the Siblings or not is not relevant for the purposes of the appeals to this Court. Section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, RSC 1985, c T-2 provides that the Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals made under the ITA. This Court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201c\u2026 is to determine the validity and correctness of the assessment based on the relevant provisions of the [ITA] and the facts giving rise to the taxpayer\u2019s statutory liability. Logically, the conduct of a tax official who authorizes an assessment is not relevant to the determination of that statutory liability\u201d (Ereiser v. The Queen, 2013 FCA 20 at para 31).\nB. Issues Raised by the Appeals\n[32] For the following reasons, which I shall elaborate upon later herein, after reviewing all the evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that Opco did not establish, even on a prima facie basis, that the Minister was incorrect in assuming, in making the reassessment, that the travel expenses were personal in nature and were not incurred by Opco for business purposes, as well as in assuming that the Licence Fees were not incurred by Opco.\n[33] I also find that the Siblings did not establish, even on a prima facie basis, that the Minister was incorrect in assuming, in making the reassessments, that they had received a benefit from Opco, either as a shareholder benefit under subsection 15(1) of the ITA or as an employee benefit under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA.\n[34] I find that Ms. Myre\u2019s and John\u2019s testimony lacked credibility and reliability. On the contrary, Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony was credible and reliable.\n[35] Furthermore, the Appellants did not submit any documentary evidence to support their testimony that Opco incurred all the disallowed travel expenses for business purposes and that these expenses were not personal in nature for the Siblings. In addition, no evidence was adduced by the Appellants at the hearing in respect of the Licence Fees.\n[36] The Court must also draw the two negative inferences discussed at paragraph 29 as requested by the Respondent.\n[37] Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s position must prevail in these appeals.\n(i) Opco\u2019s reassessment for the taxation year ended December 31, 2015\n[38] The first issue with respect to this reassessment is whether travel expenses totalling $354,644 were properly incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income and whether the travel expenses were deductible in computing Opco\u2019s business income under the ITA.\n[39] The second issue with respect to this reassessment is whether the Licence Fees totalling $42,542 were paid by Opco to the Receiver General and whether they were deductible in computing Opco\u2019s business income under the ITA.\n[40] The relevant provisions of the ITA are subsection 9(1) and paragraph 18(1)(a):\n9(1) Subject to this Part, a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business or property is the taxpayer\u2019s profit from that business or property for the year.\n\u2026\n18 (1) In computing the income of a taxpayer from a business or property no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business or property;\n...\n[41] The ITA contains no definition of the term \u201cprofit\u201d. A taxpayer may adopt any method of calculating profit that is in accordance with the ITA, established case law and well-accepted business principles, as long as it gives an accurate picture of its economic reality (Canderel Ltd v. R, [1998] 1 SCR 147, at paras 53\u201154. Furthermore, specific provisions of the ITA should be examined to determine whether an expense can be claimed as a deduction in computing income for income tax purposes.\n[42] For the following reasons, since Opco did not adduce sufficient evidence at the hearing, I find that the travel expenses totalling $354,644 were not made or incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income, but were personal travel expenses of the Siblings and other family members and were therefore not deductible in computing Opco\u2019s business income. The appeal with respect to this issue is therefore dismissed.\n[43] Also, for the following reasons, since I conclude that there was a lack of evidence adduced at the hearing by Opco, I find that the Licence Fees of $42,542 were not made or incurred by Opco and, consequently, were not deductible in computing Opco\u2019s business income. Therefore, the appeal with respect to this issue is also dismissed.\n(ii) Travel Expenses Paid by Opco in Respect of the Taxation Year Ended December 31, 2014\n[44] Although Opco\u2019s taxation year ended December 31, 2014 is not at issue in this appeal, I also find that the evidence showed that travel expenses paid by Opco totalling $507,245 were personal travel expenses of the Siblings and other family members.\n(iii) The Appellants\u2019 Reassessments (Other than Opco) for 2014 and 2015\nReassessments of John and Antigoni\n[45] With respect to the reassessments of John and Antigoni, the issue is whether the travel expenses paid by Opco have to be included in the computation of John\u2019s and Antigoni\u2019s respective incomes as benefits conferred on them by Opco as shareholders of Opco under subsection 15(1) of the ITA.\n[46] According to subsection 15(1) of the ITA, if at any time a benefit is conferred by a corporation on a shareholder of the corporation, the amount or value of the benefit is to be included in computing the income of the shareholder, except to the extent that the amount or value of the benefit is a dividend or except if one of the exceptions described in paragraphs 15(1)(a) to (d) of the ITA applies. In these appeals, the amount of the benefit is not a dividend, and none of the exceptions apply.\n[47] Subsection 15(1) of the ITA reads as follows:\n15 (1) If, at any time, a benefit is conferred by a corporation on a shareholder of the corporation \u2026 then the amount or value of the benefit is to be included in computing the income of the shareholder \u2026 for its taxation year that includes the time \u2026\n[48] Hence, the Court must determine whether a benefit was conferred by Opco on John and Antigoni and whether that benefit was conferred on John and Antigoni as shareholders of Opco. If that is the case, the Court must then determine the value of the benefit so conferred.\n[49] Three categories of travel expenses are at issue in respect of John: (i) expenses identified as John\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s (Peggy) personal expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under John\u2019s and Peggy\u2019s names: in 2014, $62,470.18 and in 2015, $75,220.43; (ii) expenses identified as Maria\u2019s (mother of the Siblings) personal expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under Maria\u2019s name (half of the amount was allocated to John and half to his sister Antigoni): in 2014, $4,753.35 and in 2015, $846.39; and (iii) expenses paid by Opco for which no credit card statements were provided to the auditor (half of the amount was allocated to John and half to Antigoni): in 2014, $144,397.03 and in 2015, $80,628.82.\n[50] Similarly, three categories of travel expenses are at issue concerning Antigoni: (i) expenses identified as Antigoni\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s (Kyriakos) personal expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under Antigoni\u2019s and Kyriakos\u2019s names: in 2014, $88,496.56 and in 2015, $100,261.58; (ii) expenses identified as Maria\u2019s personal expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under Maria\u2019s name (half of the amount was allocated to Antigoni and half to her brother, John): in 2014, $4,753.35 and in 2015, $846.39; and (iii) expenses paid by Opco for which no credit card statements were provided to the auditor (half of the amount was allocated to Antigoni and half to John): in 2014, $144,397.03 and in 2015, $80,628.82.\n[51] The travel expenses paid by Opco which, as I will explain later herein, I found were not made or incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income, are personal travel expenses of John and Antigoni. The payment of said travel expenses by Opco constitutes an appropriation of Opco\u2019s funds for the benefit of John and Antigoni. Hence, I find that a benefit was conferred by Opco on John and Antigoni.\n[52] Furthermore, for reasons that I will explain later herein, since the Appellants did not adduce sufficient evidence at the hearing, I find that a benefit was conferred on John and Antigoni by Opco as shareholders of Opco in an amount equal to the benefit included by the Minister in computing their respective incomes under subsection 15(1) of the ITA.\n[53] The reassessments were reasonable, and the appeals with respect to these issues are therefore dismissed.\nReassessments of Kostantina and Kostantinos\n[54] With respect to the reassessments of Kostantina and Kostantinos, the issue is whether the travel expenses paid by Opco have to be included in the computation of Kostantina\u2019s and Kostantinos\u2019s respective employment incomes as benefits conferred on them by Opco as employees of Opco under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA.\n[55] According to paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA, subject to certain exceptions, the value of benefits of any kind received by a taxpayer, or by a person who does not deal at arm\u2019s length with the taxpayer, in the year by virtue of the taxpayer\u2019s office or employment, has to be included in computing the employment income of the taxpayer. In these appeals, none of the exceptions apply.\n[56] Paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA reads as follows:\n6 (1) There shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year as income from an office or employment such of the following amounts as are applicable:\n(a) the value of board, lodging and other benefits of any kind whatever received or enjoyed by the taxpayer, or by a person who does not deal at arm\u2019s length with the taxpayer, in the year in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of the taxpayer\u2019s office or employment, except any benefit\n\u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[57] For Kostantina, one category of travel expenses is at issue, that is, expenses identified as Kostantina\u2019s personal travel expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under her name and totalling $6,967 in 2014 and $19,624 in 2015.\n[58] For Kostantinos, one category of travel expenses is at issue, that is, expenses identified as Kostantinos\u2019s personal travel expenses paid by Opco with an Amex credit card under his name and totalling $29,049 in 2014 and $18,549 in 2015.\n[59] The travel expenses paid by Opco which, as I will explain later, I found were not made or incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income, are personal travel expenses of Kostantina and Kostantinos. The payment of said travel expenses by Opco constitutes an appropriation of Opco\u2019s funds for the benefit of Kostantina and Kostantinos. Hence, I find that a benefit was conferred by Opco on Kostantina and Kostantinos.\n[60] Furthermore, for reasons that I will explain later herein, since the Appellants did not adduce sufficient evidence at the hearing, I find that a benefit was conferred on Kostantina and Kostantinos as employees of Opco, under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the ITA, in an amount equal to $6,967 in 2014 and $19,624 in 2015 for Kostantina, and $29,049 in 2014 and $18,549 in 2015 for Kostantinos.\n[61] The reassessments are reasonable, and the appeals with respect to these issues are therefore dismissed.\n(iv) Burden\n[62] Pursuant to subsection 152(8) of the ITA, an assessment under the ITA is deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment.\n[63] Generally, in tax appeals, the burden of proof rests on the appellant. The appellant bears the burden of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his or her position.\n[64] As explained by Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 in Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada, [1997] 2 SCR 336 at paras 92\u201395 the initial onus on the taxpayer consists in demolishing the assumptions relied upon by the Minister to make the assessment by putting forward prima facie evidence showing the inaccuracy of said assumptions. If the taxpayer puts forward such prima facie evidence, then the burden of proof shifts to the Minister, who must prove the assumptions relied upon.\n[65] A prima facie case is one \u201csupported by evidence which raises such a degree of probability in its favour that it must be accepted if believed by the Court unless it is rebutted or the contrary is proved. It may be contrasted with conclusive evidence which excludes the possibility of the truth of any other conclusion than the one established by that evidence (Stewart v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue \u2013 MNR), [2000] TCJ No 53 (QL) at para 23, cited with approval by Justice Trudel in Amiante Spec Inc. v. Canada, 2009 FCA 139 at para 23).\n[66] More recently, the Federal Court of Appeal suggested that the burden in tax appeals should instead be applied as follows. In Eisbrenner v. Canada, 2020 FCA 93 (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed, 2020 SCCA No 268), Justice Webb stated:\n[24] \u2026 In Sarmadi, I reviewed the various cases that have discussed the onus of proof issue. I also reviewed the context of an appeal to the Tax Court. I concluded that:\n[61] In my view, a taxpayer should have the burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, any facts that are alleged by that taxpayer in their notice of appeal and that are denied by the Crown. In most cases this should end the discussion of the onus of proof since the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in reassessing the taxpayer would generally be inconsistent with the facts pled by the taxpayer with respect to the material facts on which the reassessment was issued.\n[62] If there are facts that were assumed by the Minister in reassessing a taxpayer and that are not inconsistent with the facts as pled by that taxpayer, it would also seem logical to require the taxpayer to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that these facts assumed by the Minister (and which are in dispute and are not exclusively or peculiarly within the Minister\u2019s knowledge) are not correct. Requiring a taxpayer to disprove the facts assumed by the Minister in reassessing that taxpayer simply puts the onus on the person who knows (or ought to know) the facts. It also puts the onus on the person who indirectly asserted certain facts in filing their tax return that would be inconsistent with the facts assumed by the Minister in reassessing such taxpayer.\n[63] Once all of the evidence is presented, the Tax Court judge should then (and only then) determine whether the taxpayer has satisfied this burden. If the taxpayer has, on the balance of probabilities, disproven the particular facts assumed by the Minister, based on all of the evidence, there is no burden to shift to the Minister to disprove what the Tax Court judge has determined that the taxpayer has proven. Either the taxpayer has disproven the assumed facts or he, she or it has not.\n[25] In paragraph 36 of Sarmadi, I had also noted that if the Minister alleges a fact that is not part of the facts that were assumed by the Minister in assessing a taxpayer or in confirming an assessment, then the Minister will have the onus of proof with respect to such facts (Her Majesty the Queen v. Loewen, 2004 FCA 146 at para. 11, 2004 D.T.C. 6321).\n[67] I will not elaborate further on the burden that an appellant has to satisfy in tax appeals, as I find that given the very limited evidence adduced by the Appellants at the hearing, which is equivalent to a lack of evidence, and given my finding on the lack of credibility and reliability of such evidence, the Appellants did not meet the threshold of the prima facie standard, let alone the standard of the balance of probabilities, to show that the Minister\u2019s assumptions in making the reassessments were incorrect.\n(v) Review of the Evidence\n[68] In these appeals, the Appellants should have adduced detailed and cogent testimony, and supporting evidence where possible, to explain why the travel expenses were not personal in nature but were incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income. For example, the Appellants could have succeeded by establishing, on a balance of probabilities, new facts not considered by the Minister when making the reassessments; by showing that the travel expenses were incurred for business purposes; or by demonstrating that the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact in making the reassessments were wrong. However, the Appellants failed to do so.\n[69] When assessing the credibility of a witness, I can consider inconsistencies, the attitude and demeanour of the witness, motives that the witness may have to fabricate evidence, and the \u201coverall sense of the evidence\u201d. As stated by Justice Valerie Miller in Nichols v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 334, 2009 DTC 1203, at paragraph 23:\n[23] In assessing credibility I can consider inconsistencies or weaknesses in the evidence of witnesses, including internal inconsistencies (that is, whether the testimony changed while on the stand or from that given at discovery), prior inconsistent statements, and external inconsistencies (that is, whether the evidence of the witness is inconsistent with independent evidence which has been accepted by me). Second, I can assess the attitude and demeanour of the witness. Third, I can assess whether the witness has a motive to fabricate evidence or to mislead the court. Finally, I can consider the overall sense of the evidence. That is, when common sense is applied to the testimony, does it suggest that the evidence is impossible or highly improbable.\n[70] Here, the credibility and the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at the hearing are determinative (Landry v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 399, 2009 DTC 1359 at para 47; Roy v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 226, 2008 DTC 3224). I have also considered the overall reasonableness of the reassessments in my determination of whether to allow the appeals.\n[71] No supporting documentation was adduced in evidence to show that the disallowed expenses were incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income. However, I want to point out that there is no requirement that vouchers or receipts be provided for all expenditures claimed as deductions provided that the expenditures are proved by other credible evidence (see McMillan v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 393 (McMillan); Chrabalowski v. The Queen, 2004 TCC 644). Hence, there is no need to introduce every single receipt, but a taxpayer would have had to prove first, by some other credible means, that the expenditures were incurred and that they were incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing business income.\n[72] I did consider these principles in assessing the evidence adduced at the hearing of these appeals, and I find that none of this evidence was credible to support the Appellants\u2019 position that the disallowed expenses were expenses made or incurred by Opco for the purpose of gaining or producing business income.\nMs. Myre\u2019s Testimony and Ms. Lu\u2019s Testimony\n[73] For the following reasons, I find Ms. Myre\u2019s testimony to be vague, not convincing and not credible. On the contrary, I find that Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony was credible and reliable.\n[74] The evidence has shown that Ms. Myre, Opco\u2019s Financial Controller, was designated by John to coordinate the audit and be the contact person for information. Ms. Myre provided a bundle of credit card statements to the auditor. Ms. Myre and the auditor met three or four times.\n[75] I find that the evidence has shown that the auditor reviewed the credit card statements submitted by Ms. Myre and was able to determine, in conjunction with Ms. Myre and on the basis of the destination and the persons travelling with one or more of the Appellants, which travel expenses were incurred for business purposes and which were of a personal nature for the Siblings and other family members. The auditor allowed the deduction of approximately $200,000 of travel expenses without any other supporting documents other than the credit card statements: for example, travel expenses for a trip to Dubai for an annual milk show and trips to other places like Chicago, New York, Vancouver, San Diego and Washington. However, travel expenses for trips to Paris, Aruba, Nassau and Mont-Tremblant were not allowed, nor were expenses paid to Vacances Sunwing, as the auditor concluded that they were personal expenses paid by Opco for the benefit of the Siblings and other family members.\n[76] I find that the evidence has shown that Ms. Myre had indicated to the auditor during the audit that there was no supporting documentation (including emails, itineraries, contact persons, details of conferences, etc.) to show the purposes of the disallowed travel expenses. There were credit card statements for some but not all of these travel expenses.\n[77] I am not convinced by Ms. Myre\u2019s testimony to the effect that she did not remember if she had given the auditor supporting documentation for the travel expenses, other than credit card statements. If said supporting documentation was handed to the auditor at the audit stage, there is no reason justifying why it was not adduced in evidence at the hearing of the appeals.\n[78] Ms. Lu testified with respect to the audit that she performed of the various books and documents of Opco, as well as with respect to her meetings with Ms. Myre. Contemporaneous notes of the meetings were taken by Ms. Lu (Exhibit R\u20119) that support Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony.\n[79] For Opco\u2019s taxation year ended December 31, 2015, of the $586,812 in travel expenses claimed as a deduction in computing Opco\u2019s business income for tax purposes, Ms. Lu disallowed a total of $354,644.06. The disallowed travel expenses consist of the following: travel expenses totalling $161,257.63, claimed by Opco without any supporting documents or credit card statements, and travel expenses totalling $193,386.43, supported only by credit card statements.\n[80] The travel expenses totalling $161,257.63 claimed by Opco without any supporting documents or credit card statements included travel expenses paid by Opco on the Option MasterCard, Visa Desjardins and Visa credit cards. According to Ms. Lu\u2019s testimony, Ms. Myre agreed at the audit that these expenses were personal and should be allocated equally to both John and Antigoni. However, at the hearing, Ms. Myre testified that because she did not have the credit card statements, she would not have been able to determine whether an expense was personal or business-related.\n[81] Again, I do not find Ms. Myre\u2019s testimony credible. Contemporaneous notes taken by Ms. Lu (Exhibit R-9) indicate that Ms. Myre stated that the Option MasterCard, Visa Desjardins and Visa credit cards were personal credit cards. It was also established at the hearing that it is Ms. Myre\u2019s handwritten comments that appear on Exhibit R-6 and that these comments clearly indicate an allocation of these expenses equally to John and Antigoni. At the hearing, no evidence was adduced to show that the expenses were of a business nature; also, no evidence was adduced to show that the expenses should not be allocated equally to John and Antigoni.\n[82] The travel expenses totalling $193,386.43 claimed by Opco and supported only by credit card statements were made on two Amex credit cards; one Amex card had two cardholders, namely John and Peggy, and one Amex card had many cardholders, including Opco\u2019s truck drivers, the Siblings and other family members (the Appellants\u2019 spouses and the Appellants\u2019 mother, Maria). The auditor examined the credit card statements and allocated the travel expenses to the cardholders, except for Peggy\u2019s expenses, which were allocated to John; Maria\u2019s expenses, which were allocated equally to John and Antigoni; and Kyriakos\u2019s expenses, which were allocated to Antigoni.\n[83] For Opco\u2019s taxation year ended December 31, 2014 which is not at issue, the evidence showed that Ms. Lu disallowed a total of $507,245 on the basis that these were personal and not business-related travel expenses: travel expenses totalling $288,794.05, claimed by Opco without any supporting documents (and without credit card statements), and travel expenses totalling $218,451.36, supported only by credit card statements. She applied the same reasoning for 2014 as she did for 2015.\nJohn\u2019s Testimony\n[84] For the following reasons, I find that John\u2019s testimony was vague, not convincing and not credible.\n[85] His testimony was that all expenses referred to in the schedules to the replies to the notices of appeal were business expenses of Opco and should not be considered personal travel expenses of the Siblings and other family members.\n[86] Disallowed travel expenses included the following expenses:\n(i) Maria: Expenses incurred in Sint Maarten and at various restaurants; however, the evidence showed that Maria is not an employee of Opco and, therefore, John\u2019s testimony that these are business expenses is not credible;\n(ii) Kostantinos: Travel expenses incurred at the Fairmont Tremblant in Mont-Tremblant, in Nassau and at a garden store in Saint\u2011Eustache; no credible evidence was adduced as to the purposes of these expenses, and no supporting documentation was adduced at the hearing to show that these expenses were incurred by Opco for business purposes;\n(iii) Kostantina: Travel expenses incurred in Mont-Tremblant and at Marriott\u2019s Aruba Surf Club; no supporting documentation was adduced at the hearing. However, John testified that Kostantina was developing the business in Aruba, which I find is not credible. Furthermore, no evidence was adduced as to Kostantina\u2019s duties in Opco. In addition, the evidence showed that Opco\u2019s clients are located throughout North America (including Mexico) and hence, I find that it is not credible that expenses incurred in Aruba were business\u2011related;\n(iv) Kyriakos: Travel expenses incurred by Kyriakos (Antigoni\u2019s husband) at S\u00e9paq; John testified that an employees\u2019 meeting was held at S\u00e9paq. However, no supporting documentation was adduced at the hearing. I find that it would have been an easy task to provide emails or an itinerary that would have certainly been sent to Opco\u2019s employees as well as an agenda for that employees\u2019 meeting. Travel expenses incurred at the Fairmont Mont-Tremblant, in Heraklion, in Santorini and in Paris were also disallowed. No credible evidence was adduced at the hearing as to the purposes of these expenses;\n(v) Antigoni: Travel expenses paid to Vacances Sunwing and Air Canada; no credible evidence was adduced at the hearing as to the purposes of these expenses; and\n(vi) John: Travel expenses incurred under John\u2019s name at the Ritz-Carlton in Aruba and at the Ritz-Carlton in Grand Cayman as well as some expenses incurred by John\u2019s spouse at Holt Renfrew Montreal and at various restaurants. As Peggy is not an employee of Opco, it is not credible that these expenses were incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing business income for Opco. Also, as mentioned above, the evidence showed that Opco\u2019s clients are located throughout North America, including Mexico. No evidence was adduced as to whether Opco was making business developments in Aruba and Grand Cayman.\n[87] For 2014, similar types of expenses were disallowed by the auditor. For the same reasons as for 2015, I find that John\u2019s testimony is not credible.\n(vi) Adverse Inferences\n[88] An adverse inference can be drawn from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness, especially if the witness\u2019s evidence would have been central to establishing an important fact (Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 FCA 79 at para 14).\n[89] In the case at bar, the testimony of all the Appellants was central to establishing the nature of the travel expenses made or incurred by Opco and disallowed by the auditor. However, I did not receive any credible explanations justifying Antigoni\u2019s, Kostantina\u2019s and Kostantinos\u2019s absence at the hearing. I find that I should draw an adverse inference from their failure to appear and that their testimony would have shown that the travel expenses were personal in nature and not related to Opco\u2019s business.\n[90] Furthermore, I also conclude that it would have been reasonable to expect that some supporting documentation\u2014namely emails, invitations to meetings, agendas of meetings, etc.\u2014would have been adduced at the hearing indicating the purposes of the various travel expenses.\n[91] According to subsection 230(1) of the ITA, Opco must maintain and have detailed information and documentation in support of its claim that the travel expenses were incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing business income. This subsection reads as follows:\n230 (1) Every person carrying on business and every person who is required, by or pursuant to this Act, to pay or collect taxes or other amounts shall keep records and books of account (including an annual inventory kept in prescribed manner) at the person\u2019s place of business or residence in Canada or at such other place as may be designated by the Minister, in such form and containing such information as will enable the taxes payable under this Act or the taxes or other amounts that should have been deducted, withheld or collected to be determined.\n[92] That documentation would have allowed the Court to make a finding as to the nature of the travel expenses and as to whether the Licence Fees were paid or incurred by Opco. An adverse inference can also be drawn from that failure; this inference is that the receipts or other supporting documents would not have shown that the travel expenses were incurred by Opco for gaining or producing business income and that the Licence Fees were paid by Opco (McMillan at para 33).\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 28th day of February 2023.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 24\nCOURT FILE NOS:\n2019-2458(IT)G\n2019-2460(IT)I\n2019-2463(IT)G\n2019-2464(IT)G\n2019-2467(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n1048547 ONTARIO INC v.

Background [2] Mr. Doussot filed a notice of appeal in the Tax Court of Canada on November 17, 2020 under our Court\u2019s Informal Procedure. He was, and is, self\u2011represented. Subsequent to the filing of the reply by the respondent, Mr. Doussot and the respondent arrived at a settlement of the appeal dated March 11, 2022. A consent judgment was duly signed on March 28, 2022 by the judge serving as duty judge the week it was prepared. The consent judgment attached the signed settlement agreement submitted to the Court by the parties. Our Court closed its file on April 6, 2022.\n[3] Following receipt of his new reassessment, on April 20, 2022 Mr. Doussot emailed the Justice lawyer representing the respondent who had signed the settlement agreement, along with the Minister of National Revenue herself, stating that he was formally objecting to the new reassessment and asking that they reopen his file in our Court. Mr. Doussot maintained that the new reassessment by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) implementing the settlement agreement did not comply with the terms of the settlement. Mr. Doussot sent several more similar emails to the Justice lawyer and the Minister.\n[4] Our Court Registry duly and properly sent Mr. Doussot\u2019s emails to the Department of Justice lawyer in order to ascertain the Respondent\u2019s position. Our Registry then sent these on to our Court\u2019s senior French speaking judge, for directions on how to respond to Mr. Doussot, as the Chief Justice had directed that, following the retirement of our bilingual Associate Chief Justice, queries to the office of the Chief Justice received in French be so directed. That judge is, and was at the time of the Court\u2019s reply to Mr. Doussot\u2019s email, it\u2019s Acting Associate Chief Justice.\n[5] The Registry replied to Mr. Doussot\u2019s email on August 24, 2022. One of the Registry Officers properly described to Mr. Doussot how he should proceed: [Translation]\n\u201cIf you do not agree with the new assessment, you must submit a notice of objection to the chief of appeals at the Canada Revenue Agency.\nIf, after completing the above, you are not satisfied with the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s decision or if you have not received a response within 90 days of submitting the notice of objection, you can file a notice of appeal to the Tax Court of Canada.\u201d\nII. The Applicable Law and Rules [6] Issuing consent judgments, and advising individual taxpayers personally on how to file proceedings in our court are daily routine events, as it is surely for all trial courts. Our Court\u2019s staff works very hard to assist individual Canadians interacting with our Court, and our judges do the same with self-represented litigants appearing before them. Our Court has worked hard to obtain and maintain its recognition for doing so. Chief Justice Marc No\u00ebl of the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d) wrote recently:\nAs I said, this growing complexity has been criticized by many. But spare a thought for the self-reps who cannot afford legal advice but must face the same complexities. I take this occasion to pay tribute to the tremendous work done by Tax Court Judges in assisting unrepresented litigants under the informal procedure. They do their best to apprise taxpayers of their rights while at the same time maintaining their role as independent judges - not an easy task, but at the same time, an essential one. The Tax Court judges' use of the informal procedure to promote access to justice is to be commended. It should be a model to all courts.[1]\n[7] Our Court is very familiar with its jurisdiction as it is set out by statute and our Court is legally and duty bound to not exceed that jurisdiction. Our Court, like all Superior Courts, has inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own processes and procedures. In addition, our Court has its own rules in accordance with the Tax Court of Canada Act and the Tax Court of Canada Rules, along with the Rules Committee to ensure the Rules are effective and up to date.\n[8] Rule 172(2) deals with the reopening of appeals following a decision in exceptional circumstances. Our rules can be readily found on the Court\u2019s website. That rule clearly requires a motion, and it is clearly limited to exceptional circumstances:\n172 (2) A party who seeks to,\n(a) have a judgment set aside or varied on the ground of fraud or of facts arising or discovered after it was made,\n\u2026\nmay make a motion for the relief claimed.\n172 (2) Une partie peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate dans l\u2019instance, selon le cas :\na) l\u2019annulation ou la modification d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu;\n[9] Mr. Doussot\u2019s mailing to the Court would be difficult to construe as the filing of a motion. Our Registry advised him to proceed by way of objecting to his most recent notice of assessment implementing the settlement and, if not resolved with CRA, filing a new notice of appeal in respect of that reassessment and objection in our Court. This is the proper accepted and routine way for taxpayers to have our Court decide if a settlement agreement is valid and\/or whether the subsequent reassessment is in accordance with the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement.\n[10] In Quebec Fonte Inc v The Queen, 2020 TCC 126, this Court wrote:\nAnalysis and conclusions\n33 The Court has jurisdiction to decide whether an agreement between the tax authorities and a taxpayer that establishes the manner in which a taxpayer must be reassessed is applicable. It has jurisdiction to order that reassessments be made in accordance with the agreements absent circumstances vitiating the settlement. It also has jurisdiction to authorize the filing of notices of discontinuance after reassessments that are consistent with the Settlement Agreement are made: see Smerchanski v. Minister of National Revenue, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 23; University Hill Holdings Inc. v. Canada, 2017 FCA 232; Oberoi v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 293, 1390758 Ontario Corporation v.

The Queen, 2016 TCC 181.\n34 In University Hill, the Federal Court of Appeal approved the doctrine of an earlier case, Galway v. Minister of National Revenue [1974] 1 FC 600, which dealt with judgments by consent whose principles apply equally to the settlement agreements that this Court must enforce, specifying that the Court must satisfy itself \"that the judgment sought falls within the jurisdiction of the Court and is one that can be legally granted\": see paragraph 66 and those following. See also paragraph 18 in Huppe, where Mr. Justice Webb concurred.\n\u2026\nAnalyses et conclusions\n33 La Cour a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si une entente entre le fisc et un contribuable qui \u00e9tablit la mani\u00e8re dont un contribuable doit faire l'objet d'une nouvelle cotisation est applicable, elle a comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner l'\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes aux ententes en l'absence de circonstances viciant l'op\u00e9ration, et elle a comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de d\u00e9sistements apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes \u00e0 l'entente de r\u00e8glement : voir l'arr\u00eat Smerchanski c.

Voir aussi le paragraphe 18 de Huppe, o\u00f9 le juge Webb s'est exprim\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\n[11] The Federal Court of Appeal, in affirming the Quebec Fonte decision wrote in paragraph 7 at 2022 FCCA 75, [translation] \u201cIn short, we all agree that the TCC properly directed itself in law\u201d.\nIII. The Federal Court of Appeal decision [12] Mr. Doussot appealed the letter from our Registry to the Federal Court of Appeal. At the end of lengthy reasons on November 21, 2022, that Court dismissed his appeal stating in paragraph 14 that [Translation]\n\u201cThis type of request must be made by motion, and not as it is seen here, through a simple email. This is not a procedural whim but, rather, a mandatory requirement, since to succeed, an applicant must prove that the cancellation or modification of the judgment in question is supported by reason of fraud or events that occurred or were discovered after the judgment was rendered. This requires proof, hence the need to file a proper motion addressed to the TCC.\u201d\nIV. The Fresh Objection [13] This Court understands from the FCA decision, as well as from the current motion materials, that the taxpayer did file a fresh objection to the new reassessment implementing the consent judgment. However, both the FCA and the taxpayer\u2019s current motion materials make it clear that the Minister was of the view that it was not a valid objection.\n[14] The respondent apparently relied upon subsection 165(1.2) which precludes objections being filed to reassessments implementing settlement agreements and consent judgments.\n[15] For the reasons stated in Quebec Fonte, that subsection does not preclude a taxpayer who has been reassessed following a settlement agreement challenging whether the subsequent reassessment is in accordance with that settlement agreement.\n[16] Mr. Doussot had the right to file a notice of appeal in respect of his objection under subsection 169(1) within 90 days of the Minister responding to his objection. While that period has passed, section 167 of the Act provides a further one year period in which a taxpayer can appeal to our Court after the expiry of the 90-day period.\n[17] Mr. Doussot\u2019s motion materials were filed within that further one year. In the circumstances, this Court is prepared to consider those materials to also constitute a request for an extension of time within which to file his notice of appeal. This Court also considers those materials, combined with his initial mailing to our Court and his appearance before the FCA, to satisfy the requirements of subsection 169(5). This allows Mr. Doussot to pursue in our Court his concerns that the reassessment does not follow the settlement he reached with the CRA.\n[18] Mr. Doussot appears to have also contacted the office of the Minister of National Revenue directly. Part of the Minister\u2019s response says no objection can be filed to the reassessment in question. This appears to be clearly wrong in law (although this appears not to have been acknowledged or recognised in the FCA proceeding). This Court clearly has jurisdiction to hear appeals from reassessments to determine the issue of whether the reassessments are in accordance with the terms of a valid settlement agreement, notwithstanding section 165(1.2), which states that\n\u201cno objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection \u2026 169(3)\u2026 nor, for greater certainty, in respect of an issue to for which the right of objection has been waive in writing by the taxpayer\u201d\n\u00ab Aucune opposition ne peut \u00eatre faite par un contribuable \u00e0 une cotisation \u00e9tablie en application des paragraphes \u2026 169(3)... il est entendu que cette interdiction vaut pour les oppositions relatives \u00e0 une question pour laquelle le contribuable a renonc\u00e9 par \u00e9crit \u00e0 son droit d\u2019opposition. \u00bb\nV. Conclusion [19] Notwithstanding the odd, questionable and very circuitous path to where things now stand, it is clear from what Mr. Doussot has filed in support of this motion, that he is:\nappealing to this Court from the new reassessments that he is already objected to,\nchallenging the validity of the settlement agreement,\nmaintaining that the new reassessment is not in accordance with the terms of the settlement arrived at, and\nmaintaining that the terms of settlement are not properly reflected in the settlement agreement.\n[20] For the reasons above this Court on this motion orders as follows:\nRegistry will open a new appeal file for which Mr. Doussot\u2019s motion materials constitute a sufficient notice of appeal as of the date this motion was filed, and for which, if necessary, an extension is hereby granted under section 167 of the Act.\nMr. Doussot will have 90 days to file an amended notice of appeal or a fresh notice of appeal that is focused on:\n1)the terms of the settlement;\n2)whether the settlement agreement correctly sets out those terms\n3)whether the reassessment properly implements those terms; and\n4)any other reasons that bring the validity of the settlement agreement into question.\nThis is needed for the respondent to fully understand and reply to Mr. Doussot\u2019s notice of appeal. It is also needed to focus the parties and the Court on the issues in dispute.\nThe respondent will file its reply within 60 days of the filing of Mr. Doussot\u2019s amended notice of appeal.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 25th day of May 2023.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 26\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-2107(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTONY DOUSSOT AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Patrick Boyle\nDATE OF ORDER:\nMarch 3, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the appellant:\nSelf-represented\nFor the respondent:\n\u00c9liane Mandeville\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Address at the Canadian Tax Foundation Annual Conference 2022, \"Judges Panel\" November 20 2022.

INTRODUCTION\n[1] The Respondent seeks to quash the Appeal submitting that the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. In the unusual circumstances of this case, the Court reserved on the Respondent\u2019s Motion, and directed that the Appeal be heard on the assumption that jurisdiction exists. Accordingly, the Appellant testified and made full submissions to support the merits of the lengthy and detailed Appeal she had framed, and the Respondent cross-examined the Appellant, and made full submissions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Appeal was dismissed, based on oral reason that need not be repeated herein,\n[2] The Reasons that follow explain the Court\u2019s decision to adopt the submissions of the Respondent, pursuant to section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C 1985, C T-2, as amended, quashing the Appeal on the foundation that the Court lacks jurisdiction.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. A summary of the salient facts\n[3] For present purposes, suffice it to say that the Appellant\u2018s grievance addresses the amount of the Saskatchewan graduate tuition tax credit (the \u2018SGTTC\u2019) that was available to reduce the Appellant\u2019s Saskatchewan tax for the 2020 taxation year. The SGTTC is a tax credit applied against provincial tax in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 2000, SS, C 1-2.01.\n[4] Of note, the Respondent took no issue with the fact that the Minister did purport to assess the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the SGTTC in respect of prior taxation years. Indeed, a portion of the cross-examination of the Appellant was devoted to the actions of officials of the Canada Revenue Agency in applying the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to SGTTC credit in other years.\nB. The relevant pleadings of the Respondent\n[5] On August 11, 2022, the Respondent filed a Reply with a Schedule, involving 13 paragraphs. Set out below are the passages relevant to the main question of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and to the first secondary question, that of procedural fairness in the case of a self-represented party:\n1) The Respondent will file a Motion on the day of the hearing of this Appeal to quash the Appeal in its entirety, on the basis that it is not properly before the Tax Court of Canada because this Appeal is in respect of the amount of the Saskatchewan graduate tuition tax credit (the \u2018SGTTC\u2019) available to reduce the Appellant\u2019s Saskatchewan tax for the 2020 taxation year. The SGTTC is a tax credit applied against provincial tax in accordance with the [provincial] Income Tax Act, 2000 [\u2026]. Pursuant to s, 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act \u2026 this Court\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to appeals of assessments under the Income Tax Act, 2000, which must be appealed to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Saskatchewan.\n[\u2026]\n2) [\u2026] 9) The Issues are whether:\na) The Appellant\u2019s Appeal with respect to the 2020 taxation year is properly before the Tax Court of Canada; [\u2026]\n10) The AGC relies on subsections 118.5(1), 165(1), 167(1), 169(1) and 248(1) of the Income Tax Act \u2026 The AGC also relies on subsection 12(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Act and sections 37.1, 37.2, 39.1, 39.11, 98, 99, 102 and 103 of the Income Tax Act, 2000.\n11) The AGC respectfully submits that pursuant to subsection 12(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Act, the Tax Court of Canada does not have jurisdiction to consider the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the SGTTC. Under subsection 181(1) of the Income Tax Act, the Court can either dismiss an appeal from an assessment, or allow the appeal by vacating the assessment, varying the assessment, or referring the assessment back to the Minister to reconsideration and reassessment. The Tax Court of Canada\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to appeals of assessments under the Income Tax Act, 2000, which must be appealed to the Court of King Bench for Saskatchewan. [Emphasis added]\nC. The Court\u2019s procedural decisions\n[6] At the outset of the hearing, the Court invited Counsel for the Respondent to submit all relevant information and case law in support of its position. The Court observed that if the Respondent\u2019s argument was so compelling that it appeared that there was no possible outcome other than to order the quashing of the Appeal, the Appellant would then advance her submissions. If this opportunity to respond did not result in identifying some hope of success in having the Appeal heard, the Respondent\u2019s position would prevail and the Appeal quashed.\n[7] In the result, since the Respondent\u2019s submissions did not establish an unanswerable case, the Court did not invite the Appellant to respond, directing that these submissions in response on the subject of jurisdiction would be presented after the parties had debated the merits of the Appeal. Part of the justification for the order of submissions arose from the obvious pains taken by the Appellant in preparing a comprehensive multiple page factual outline and the submission of dozens of documents. The Court feared that an error on the chief issue of jurisdiction would potentially bring about a further trial \u201con the merits\u201d in the distant future and that this procedure did not compromise the duty of the Court to apply the law on the day of trial.\nD. The result of the hearing\n[8] The Respondent demonstrated by means of a probing and respectful cross-examination, with documentation in support including the affidavit of Satvinder K. Hundal of January 24, 2023, that the Appellant had benefited from various internal decisions allocating appropriate credit for past SGTTC and that the Appeal was not meritorious. The Appellant demonstrated a number of prior errors but did not show that any of the assumptions found in the Reply were in error.\nE. Further submissions were advanced\n[9] The Respondent not having demonstrated that the Applicant had no possibility of a successful outcome at the conclusion of its initial submission, the Applicant went on to testify and to argue her case and the Court held that the well honed submissions contained in the Respondent\u2019s reply were correct. At the end of the day, the Appellant failed to demonstrate any error in the assumptions set out in the Reply and thus was incapable of justifying any relief. It is hoped, however, that the Applicant will seek a reconsideration of her prior grievances if she is able to obtain clear documentation from the University of Ottawa setting out any error in respect of her prior academic achievements, and costs and expenses to attain this success.\nF. A review of the case law on the issue of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction\n(1) Introductory Comment [10] By way of introductory comment, the Respondent\u2019s decision not to file a casebook well in advance of the hearing contributed to the bifurcated procedure adopted by the Court. The controversy facing the Court on the morning of the hearing follows: either to take a few hours to review the cases supplied at the start of the hearing, or allowing the anxious Applicant to go ahead. Foremost in the Court\u2019s analysis was the estimation that reviewing the cases would require three or more hours. The self-represented litigant would require far less time to marshal her documents as she was well prepared and being anxious to begin, as noted, the Court elected to hear the case. Thereafter, a decision would be made as to the jurisdictional issue.\n[11] This difficulty would have been avoided with a casebook. As it turns out, the Court required about six hours to consider fully the authorities submitted and other relevant precedents the Court researched.\n(2) The legislative scheme commands a narrow view of jurisdiction [12] It will be of assistance to analyze the case law by means of a thematic review to make plain that the Crown is correct to state that the legislative scheme severely restricts the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada.\n(3) The Tax Court of Canada is purely statutory in origin [13] At the outset, the case of Andrew Paving & Engineering Ltd. and Meld Development Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, 84 DTC 1157, decided by Chief Justice Christie, commands our attention. The relevant lengthy passage is found at page 1161:\nThis Court is without jurisdiction with reference to these appeals to the extent that they pertain to penalties imposed and interest levied in relation to the $18,067.21. The existence of a collection agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario cannot alter this. Division E of the Ontario Act provides for appeals to the Supreme Court of Ontario from assessments made under that legislation. Nothing in the Act, the Tax Court of Canada Act, or any other legislation enacted by or under the authority of the Parliament of Canada purports to confer such jurisdiction on this Court. The Tax Court of Canada is purely statutory in origin and the scope of its jurisdiction is entirely circumscribed by express or necessarily implied federal legislative authority. Moreover, I am of the opinion that if legislation were enacted by Parliament which purported to confer jurisdiction on the Tax Court of Canada to hear appeals from assessments made under the Ontario Act, it would be beyond the constitutional reach of Parliament. The Tax Court of Canada was established under the authority of section 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. It provides:\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada. [Emphasis added]\n[14] I now wish to quote from the authority set out in Hennick v. Canada, [1998] T.C.J. No. 562, a judgment of Justice Bowman, later Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada. The Court observed at paragraphs 11 and 12:\n11 Christie A.C.J. said in Lamash Estate v. M.N.R., 91 D.T.C. 9 at page 16:\nOn further reflection I am reinforced in my view that the court does not have the jurisdiction referred to. The Tax Court of Canada is a purely statutory creation and its jurisdiction is confined to what is expressly conferred on it by Parliament and what is necessarily implied from what is expressly conferred. [Emphasis added]\nThe Tax Court of Canada\u2019s jurisdiction is entirely circumscribed by express or necessarily implied federal legislative authority\n[15] Refer again to Andrew Paving & Engineering Ltd. and Meld Development Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, 84 DTC 1157, at page 1161, as well as to Hennick v. Canada, [1998] T.C.J. No. 562, at para. 11.\n[16] In the case of Gardner v. Canada, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1954, 2001 FCA 401, Stone, Rothstein and Sexton JJ.A. provided valuable guidance on the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada at para. 16. As written by Sexton J.A. for the Court: \u201cBoth the federal government and provinces have the jurisdiction to enact income tax laws. The Tax Court has jurisdiction with respect to provincial income tax only to the extent that jurisdiction is conferred upon it by the province. It is open to a province to reserve onto itself jurisdiction to decide particular issues with respect to its income tax and Ontario has done this\u2026\u201d [Emphasis added]\n[17] In this instance, the Respondent argued that the provincial legislation conferred jurisdiction upon the Saskatchewan\u2019s King Bench to settle the type of Appeal framed by the Appellant.\n[18] I now draw attention to the remarks advanced by the Federal Court of Appeal in Sutcliffe v. Canada, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1937, 2004 FCA 376. Noel J.A., later the Chief Justice, allowed an appeal from a judgment of the Tax Court of Canada and consigned these signal remarks, concurred in by Rothstein J.A., as he then was, and Sharlow J.A:\n10 When the Minister makes such a determination, the provinces to which the income is allocated are entitled to assess tax. The record reveals that provincial income taxes were assessed on the basis of this allocation, not under the Act, but under the taxing statutes of respective provinces.\n11 The income tax act of the provinces to which the income was allocated all provide for a right of appeal to the respective provincial superior courts from assessments levying provincial taxes on the basis of this allocation (Income Tax Act, R.S.N.B. c.I-2, s.22; Income Tax Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c.134, s.22; Income Tax Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c.I-1, s.26(1); Income Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c.215, s.42; Alberta Personal Income Tax Act, R.S.A 1980, c.A31, s.30; Income Tax Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1998, c.I-1, s.26; Income Tax Act, R.S.S. 1978, c.I-2, s.26; Income Tax Act, R.S.M. 1988, c.110, s.30; Income Tax Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I-2, s.23). [Emphasis added]\n[19] The Court added, at para. 14: \u201c\u2026 the Tax Court of Canada does not have jurisdiction to pronounce on the validity of an assessment of provincial income taxes. This jurisdiction belongs to the superior courts of the respective provinces pursuant to the provincial statutes to which I have referred (see as to this Andrew Paving and Engineering Ltd. et al. v. M.N.R., 84 DTC 1157 (TCC); The Queen v. Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited, 87 DTC 5382 (F.C.A.); Hennick v. Canada, [1998] T.C.J. No. 562; Gardner v. R., 2002 DTC 6776 (FCA))\u201d.\n(4) No jurisdiction respecting an assessment of provincial income tax [20] The direct statement found at page 5834 of The Queen v. Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited, 87 D.T.C. 5382 (F.C.A.), per Pratte J.A. is authoritative: \u201cCounsel for the respondent also argued in support of the judgment that the notices of reassessment of January 4, 1984, were not superseded by those of March 6 because the latter left intact the assessment of provincial tax contained in the earlier ones. This argument has no merit since this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from an assessment of provincial income tax.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n(5) No scope for equitable relief or based upon \u201cfairness\u201d [21] The Court also considered the case of Chaya v. Canada, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1630, 2004 FCA 327, in which Justice Rothstein, as he then was, wrote for the Panel including Chief Justice Richard and L\u00e9tourneau J.A. As we read at para. 4: \u201cThe applicant says that the law is unfair and he asks the Court to make an exception for him. However the Court does not have that power. The Court must take the statute as it finds it. It is not open to the Court to make exceptions to statutory provisions on the grounds of fairness or equity. If the applicant considers the law unfair, his remedy is with Parliament, not with the Court.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n(6) The signal importance of s. 171 of the Income Tax Act [22] I now draw attention to the remarks advanced by the Federal Court of Appeal in Sutcliffe v. Canada, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1937, 2004 FCA 376, at para. 15: \u201c\u2026 The Tax Court of Canada derives its jurisdiction from statute. On an appeal pursuant to subsection 169(1), it may only grant the relief provided for in subsection 171(1) (vary, vacate or refer the assessment back to the Minister).\u201d\n(7) The signal importance of s. 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act [23] Below are para. 8 and para. 9 of A&E Precision Fabricating and Machine Shop Inc. v. Canada, 2013 FCA 173, a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal delivered by Dawson J.A., on behalf of Sharlow and Stratas JJ.A.\n8 Next, the Judge found that the respondent had set off its obligation to pay the taxed costs against the appellants' tax debts, and that the Tax Court had no jurisdiction to review such set off.\n9 We agree that the Tax Court had no jurisdiction to review the respondent's set off. In the present cases, the jurisdiction of the Tax Court was limited to hearing and determining the appeals brought under the Act (subsection 12(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2. This does not include the power to review collection procedures employed by the respondent. Jurisdiction with respect to collection procedures lies with the Federal Court. [Emphasis added]\n[24] Ereiser v. Canada, [2013] F.C.J. No. 102, 2013 FCA 20 (F.C.A.), includes a good number of relevant remarks, penned by Sharlow J.A. on behalf of Pelletier and Mainville JJ.A. Firstly:\n26 With that background, I turn to the statutory provisions that define the jurisdiction and role of the Tax Court of Canada with respect to appeals from income tax assessments. Its jurisdiction is established by subsection 12(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, which reads as follows:\n12. (1) The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine references and appeals to the Court on matters arising under ... the Income Tax Act... when references or appeals to the Court are provided for in those Acts.\n12. (1) La Cour a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour entendre les renvois et les appels port\u00e9s devant elle sur les questions d\u00e9coulant de l'application de ... la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces lois pr\u00e9voient un droit de renvoi ou d'appel devant elle.\n27 To understand the role of the Tax Court of Canada in income tax appeals, it is useful to begin with subsection 152(8) of the Income Tax Act, which sets out the legal effect of an assessment. It reads as follows:\n152. (8) An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\n152. (8) Sous r\u00e9serve des modifications qui peuvent y \u00eatre apport\u00e9es ou de son annulation lors d'une opposition ou d'un appel fait en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie et sous r\u00e9serve d'une nouvelle cotisation, une cotisation est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre valide et ex\u00e9cutoire malgr\u00e9 toute erreur, tout vice de forme ou toute omission dans cette cotisation ou dans toute proc\u00e9dure s'y rattachant en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[25] I consider that it will assist the Appellant to understand more fully the result if I reproduce the paragraphs that follow:\n28 Subsections 165(1) and 169(1) of the Income Tax Act give a taxpayer the right to object to an assessment (which essentially is an administrative review) and then to appeal the assessment to the Tax Court of Canada. Those provisions read as follows:\n165. (1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts ....\n169. (1) Where a taxpayer has served notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied\n[26] Subsection 171(1) sets out the ways in which the Tax Court of Canada may dispose of an appeal. It reads as follows:\n171. (1) The Tax Court of Canada may dispose of an appeal by:\n(a) dismissing it; or\n(b) allowing it and\n(i) vacating the assessment,\n(ii) varying the assessment, or\n(iii) referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\n171. (1) La Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t peut statuer sur un appel:\na) en le rejetant;\nb) en l'admettant et en :\n(i) annulant la cotisation,\n(ii) modifiant la cotisation,\n(iii) d\u00e9f\u00e9rant la cotisation au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation.\n[27] Section 166 of the Income Tax Act limits the grounds upon which an assessment may be vacated or varied on appeal. It reads as follows:\n166. An assessment shall not be vacated or varied on appeal by reason only of any irregularity, informality, omission or error on the part of any person in the observation of any directory provision of this Act.\n166. Une cotisation ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9e ni modifi\u00e9e lors d'un appel uniquement par suite d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, de vice de forme, d'omission ou d'erreur de la part de qui que ce soit dans l'observation d'une disposition simplement directrice de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[28] By way of emphasis and to avoid any lack of clarity, Justice Stratas wrote the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Pereira v. Canada (Attorney General), [2017] F.C.J. No. 1195. I have reproduced below his observations at para. 15:\n15 The Tax Court had no jurisdiction to deal with this ground. The Tax Court can deal only with the validity of an assessment, not enforcement action taken by the Canada Revenue Agency. Challenges to decisions concerning enforcement can be pursued in the Federal Court by way of judicial review, but not in the Tax Court. See, e.g, A&E Precision Fabricating and Machine Shop Inc. v. Canada, 2013 FCA 173, at para. 9. [Emphasis added]\nThe validity and correctness of the assessment is solely what is to be considered \u2013 not the conduct of officials in reaching the assessment\n(8) No power to amend legislation\n[29] The Federal Court of Appeal considered this jurisdictional issue in MacKay v. Canada, [2015] F.C.J. No. 456, 2015 FCA 94, and upheld the authority and wisdom of that judgment. Ryer, Near and Rennie JJ.A. held as follows:\n2 This appeal is unusual in that the appellant does not argue that the amounts of tax, interest and penalties assessed against him for 2006 are incorrect. Rather, he argues that the amounts assessed as a result of the application of the formula in section 34.1 of the Income Tax Act are unfair and unjustified. In essence he argues that the formula in that provision of the Act ought to be changed. Unfortunately this Court has no power to amend legislation. [Emphasis added]\n[30] Noteworthy as well is the subsequent case of Meyer v. Canada, [2019] T.C.J. No. 103, 2019 TCC 131, per Lafleur J., which illustrates the ongoing vitality of the Chaya decision. Due to the elegance of the language penned by Justice Lafleur, I think it wise to merely reproduce her wise words:\n4 At the hearing, Mr. Meyer argued that the amount of $79,089 he had withdrawn from his RRSP should not have been included in the calculation of his income for the purposes of the EI benefits' repayment under section 145 of the EI Act, as benefits paid out of his RRSP, being of a different nature, should not be considered as income for the purposes of the EI Act.\n5 At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent referred to the relevant provisions of the ITA and the EI Act. As benefits received out of an RRSP (subsection 146(8) of the ITA) must be included in the calculation of income under paragraph 56(1)(h) and section 3 of the ITA, the amount of $79,089 has to be included in Mr. Meyer's income for the purposes of sections 144 and 145 of the EI Act. Counsel for the Respondent also aptly explained to the Court that Mr. Meyer would probably like to see Parliament amend section 144 of the EI Act so as to exclude from the calculation of income any amount received as a benefit out of an RRSP, as it has been done with respect to payments out of a registered disability savings plan. [Emphasis added]\n6 Mr. Meyer informed the Court that he now has a better understanding of the relevant provisions and that he understands that his argument cannot succeed.\n7 I also explained to Mr. Meyer the role of this Court in an appeal under the ITA, which is to determine whether the assessment in issue is valid and correct in light of the relevant statutory provisions and the facts of the case (Ereiser v. The Queen, 2013 FCA 20, 2013 DTC 5036, para. 31). The same principle applies for the purposes of the EI Act.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n(9) The absence of jurisdiction in assessment deriving from provincial legislation illustrated\n[31] The Crown invited the Court to apply the instruction found in Baluyot v. Canada, [2007] T.C.J. No. 473, 2007 TCC 682, a judgment of Justice Miller. The issue of the jurisdiction of the Court arose in the context of a credit against an Ontario tax. The taxpayer submitted that there was an exception to the rule according to which no appeal could be pursued before the Tax Court of Canada from an assessment where there were no taxes payable because of the tax credit. The essence of the Court\u2019s ruling that is of assistance to the undersigned is set out below:\n6 The tax credit at issue in this appeal is the OFTC, which is a credit against Ontario tax and is granted under subsection 4(6) of the Ontario Income Tax Act. As a result, it is a provincial tax and the Tax Court of Canada does not have jurisdiction to pronounce on the validity of an assessment of provincial income taxes. (See Sutcliffe v. R., [2005] 1 C.T.C. 149, at paragraph 14, and Hennick v. Canada, [1998] T.C.J. No. 562 at paragraph 9.).\n7 The Appellant's final ground for opposing the motion to dismiss was that the issue under appeal involved the calculation of the amount of tax payable under the Federal Act. Pursuant to subsection 23(2.1) of the Ontario Income Tax Act there is no appeal from an assessment in respect of the computation of the amount of tax payable under the Federal Act to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. He argued that by implication the Tax Court of Canada has jurisdiction to hear the present appeal.\n8 I disagree with the Appellant. The Tax Court of Canada is a statutory Court and its jurisdiction is limited by statute (See Little v. The Queen, [2007] 2 C.T.C. 2062). [Emphasis added] Section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act provides for the matters over which this Court has jurisdiction as follows:\n12.(1) The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine references and appeals to the Court on matters arising under the Air Travellers Security Charge Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, Part V.1 of the Customs Act, the Employment Insurance Act, the Excise Act, 2001, Part IX of the Excise Tax Act, the Income Tax Act, the Old Age Security Act, the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act and the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 when references or appeals to the Court are provided for in those Acts.\nJurisdiction\n(2) The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals on matters arising under the War Veterans Allowance Act and the Civilian War-related Benefits Act and referred to in section 33 of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act.\nFurther jurisdiction\n(3) The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine questions referred to it under section 51 or 52 of the Air Travellers Security Charge Act, section 97.58 of the Customs Act, section 204 or 205 of the Excise Act, 2001, section 310 or 311 of the Excise Tax Act, section 173 or 174 of the Income Tax Act or section 62 or 63 of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006.\n[32] Having just referred to Little v. Canada, [2006] T.C.J. No. 509, 2006 TCC 627, it will be of interest to quote the guidance provided by Justice McArthur, in light of the relative similarities between the case at Bar and the situation in Little. At the outset, I note that the trial judge remarked:\n1 This motion is for an order quashing the Appellant's appeal from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue for the 2004 taxation year, on the grounds that this Court does not have the jurisdiction to determine whether provincial income tax is payable and, in this instance, to the Province of Nova Scotia. [Emphasis added]\n[33] I note particularly the procedural history outlined in para. 2:\n2 The appeal was brought under the Informal Procedure and the Respondent was granted leave to proceed with the motion on short notice. At the conclusion of the motion hearing I reserved my decision, and the Appellant proceeded with his appeal. After the hearing of the motion, and of course before giving a decision, I had stated that if I was of the same opinion after reviewing the evidence and submissions, I would grant the motion quashing the appeal for 2004. I am of the same mind. The appeal is quashed, and because I have no jurisdiction to make a binding decision with regard to residency, my opinion in that regard is just that, an opinion.\n[34] The Court then stated: \u201c5 The Tax Court of Canada is a statutory Court, and its jurisdiction is limited by statute. Section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act provides for the matters over which this Court has jurisdiction\u2026\u201d\n[35] Counsel for the Crown also cited Jersak v. Canada, [2020] T.C.J. No. 112, 2020 TCC 136, a judgment of Wong J. The relevant passages follow:\n5 By agreement with Alberta, the Minister calculates the amount of the Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit [AFETC] and Alberta Climate Leadership Adjustment Rebate [ACLAR] based on the information in an individual's filed return. However, this Court is not the legal venue when a disagreement arises with respect to these provincial amounts. Section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act lists the statutes over which this Court has jurisdiction and they are all federal. As I explained to Ms. Jersak at the hearing, whatever jurisdiction or ability exists to hear a dispute involving the AFETC and ACLAR will lie at the provincial level [Footnote 1 reads: Climate Leadership Implementation Act, S.A. 2016, c. 16; Alberta Personal Income Tax Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-30.]; I can only clearly say that this Court does not have it. [Footnote 2 reads: Perron v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 220 at paragraph 4. [Emphasis added]\n6 The UCCB is a benefit governed by the federal Universal Child Care Benefit Act. Neither that Act nor section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act gives this Court the jurisdiction to hear disputes over the UCCB. As I explained to Ms. Jersak at the hearing, the UCCB Act is a short statute and does not appear to have a mechanism for resolving disputes. Again, I can only clearly say that this Court does not have jurisdiction. [Perron v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 220 at paragraph 4.]\n[36] The further guidance I draw from the judgment of Wong J. is found at para. 7: \u201cIn the reply to the notice of appeal, the Respondent gave notice of the preliminary motion to quash the appeal of the 2013 base taxation year on the basis that no valid objection was filed; however, a section 244 affidavit was not filed in support.\u201d In this instance, there was notice to the Appellant contained in the Reply and an Affidavit, much later, but no guidance from case law.\n[37] Para. 4 of the judgment of Russell J. in the case of Perron v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 220, is set out below:\n4 I concur with the Respondent that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear any appeal from denial of UCCBs and AFETCs. The UCCB is provided for in the federal Universal Child Care Benefit Act, but neither that statute nor any other legislation gives jurisdiction over the UCCB to this Court. Goldstein v Her Majesty, 2013 TCC 165 (Inf.) confirms this conclusion. As for the AFETC, it is provided for in the Alberta Personal Income Tax Act (Alberta), being provincial legislation. This Court does not have jurisdiction in respect of provincial legislation. Additionally the stated Alberta statute provides the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench with the jurisdiction to hear appeals respecting AFETC determinations. [Emphasis added]\n[38] The last underlined sentence echoes the submission of the Respondent Crown in this case as the Court of King\u2019s Bench has been identified, without challenge, as the correct avenue for redress, though neither the Court nor the Crown were able to locate a single reported decision demonstrating recourse to that Superior Court.\n[39] I note as well that Justice Russell observed at para. 3: \u201c\u2026 Notice of the motion and a copy of the proposed Amended Reply had been served upon Ms. Perron several days earlier. Of course, whether or not an issue as to jurisdiction has been pleaded or otherwise raised by either of the parties does not affect the actual jurisdiction of this Court in any case.\u201d\n[40] Further, these comments are apposite:\n15 ... The jurisdiction of this Court, in the context of this case, simply extends to deciding whether the Minister's redeterminations as to the CCTB and GSTC\/HSTC are or are not correct. No provision in the Act enables the Minister or this Court to consider the factor of undue hardship should this appeal as to the said tax credits not otherwise be allowed. Rather, consideration of that factor would be for the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in its exercise of its comprehensive jurisdiction to establish appropriate support payments in a full family law context for Ms. Perron.\n[41] Justice Woods, now a member of the Federal Court of Appeal, wrote the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada in Goldstein v. Canada, [2013] T.C.J. No. 131, 2013 TCC 165. The judgment records at the outset that \u201c1. the appeal with respect to the Universal Child Care Benefit Act is quashed\u2026\u201d The Court went on to remark at para. 3: \u201cThere are two preliminary matters. First, the appeal under the Universal Child Care Benefit Act should be quashed because this Court does not have the authority to decide appeals under this legislation: Fatima v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 49.\u201d\n[42] Justice Woods also rendered judgment in the case of Fatima, 2012 TCC 49, and I find it of assistance to reproduce paragraphs 5 and 6, that serve to explain why the Court quashed the appeal with respect to benefits under the Universal Child Care Benefit Act.\n5 At the hearing, I raised a question as to whether the Tax Court of Canada has jurisdiction with respect to the UCCB. Counsel for the Crown responded that the residence issue was the same under both statutes and that the Court's decision concerning the child tax benefit under the Income Tax Act would be followed for purposes of the UCCB. This may be a satisfactory practical solution in this case, but the jurisdiction issue should have been mentioned in the Reply. [Emphasis added]\n6 In Moise v The Queen, 2009 TCC 187, Sheridan J. concluded that the Tax Court of Canada did not have jurisdiction with respect to the UCCB. I see no reason to depart from this decision. The appeal with respect to benefits under the UCCB will therefore be quashed.\n[43] With respect to the judgment in Mo\u00efse v. Canada, [2009] T.C.J. No. 140, 2009 TCC 187, decided by Sheridan J., it supports the Crown\u2019s submission in the case at Bar. As we read at para. 3:\n3 At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent correctly raised a preliminary objection to the Appellant's having included in her appeal a request for relief in respect of her claim under the Universal Child Care Benefit Act on the basis that this Court does not have jurisdiction over such appeals. Upon understanding this, the Appellant effectively withdrew that aspect of her appeal.\n(10) A case that summarizes well the foregoing review of the case law\n[44] Bauer v. Canada, [2016] T.C.J. No. 104, 2016 TCC 136, was also cited by the Crown counsel in support of its argument that the Court is without jurisdiction. In particular, I was invited to consider the following passages from the judgment of Lyons J:\n2 Generally, the grounds in the Motion are that the appellant pled factual allegations, issues and arguments relating to matters outside this Court's jurisdiction which have no chance of success, are frivolous, abusive and, if retained, would delay the appeal. [Emphasis added] Specifically, the pleading improperly:\na) focuses on conduct of Canada Revenue Agency officials during the investigation, audit, reassessment and objection processes (\"CRA officials\" and \"CRA conduct\"), the disclosure of documents under the Privacy Act and the legality of the requirements for information (\"requirements\");\n[\u2026]\nJurisdiction of the Tax Court\n10 As a statutory Court, this Court has been granted exclusive original jurisdiction to determine references and appeals from assessments (or reassessments) made under the ITA. [Footnote 3 reads: Section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, The Tax Court is a superior Court.] That authority, combined with subsections 169(1) and 171(1) of the ITA, limits the Court's statutory jurisdiction to determining the validity and correctness of an assessment as to a taxpayer's liability for the amount of tax assessed and enables the Court to dismiss an appeal or allow an appeal by vacating, varying or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. [Emphasis added]\n[45] Thereafter, the Court was invited to scrutinize these paragraphs, and though they are lengthy, they are very important and are thus reproduced in full:\n24 Significantly, the jurisdictional limits of this Court are not only circumscribed by section 169 of the ITA, but have been consistently reaffirmed by the findings of the Federal Court of Appeal in Main Rehabilitation Co. v Canada, [2004 FCA 403, 2004 DTC 6762 (FCA)], Ereiser, [2013 FCA 20, 2013 DTC 5036, leave to appeal to SCC refused, 3529, [2013] S.C.C.A. No. 167 (April 5, 2013)], Canada (Minister of National Revenue - MNR) v JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., [2013 FCA 250, 2014 DTC 5001], and other jurisprudence. That is, the Tax Court's jurisdiction in a tax appeal is limited to determining if an assessment is valid and correct, but does not include challenges to the processes by which the reassessments and tax liability were established, the manner\/method in which the amount was determined, the exercise of ministerial powers nor CRA conduct generally (the \"Main principle). [Emphasis added]\n25 In Main, Rothstein J.A., as he then was, stated that:\n[8] This is because what is in issue in an appeal pursuant to section 169 is the validity of the assessment and not the process by which it is established [...] Put another way, the question is not whether the CCRA officials exercised their powers properly, but whether the amounts assessed can be shown to be properly owing under the Act [...] [Emphasis added]\n26 After reaffirming the Main principle, the Court in Ereiser held that \"it is plain and obvious that this Court will not vacate the reassessments under appeal on the basis of the wrongful conduct of a tax official in authorizing them\". Sharlow J.A. stated:\n[31] [...] the role of the Tax Court of Canada in an appeal of an income tax assessment is to determine the validity and correctness of the assessment based on the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and the facts giving rise to the taxpayer's statutory liability. Logically, the conduct of a tax official who authorizes an assessment is not relevant to the determination of that statutory liability. It is axiomatic, the wrongful conduct of an official is not relevant to the determination of the validity or correctness of an assessment. ...\n27 Even where CRA conduct leading up to an assessment is reprehensible, this Court does not have jurisdiction. As stated by Stratas J.A. in J.P. Morgan:\n[83] The Tax Court does not have jurisdiction on an appeal to set aside an assessment on the basis of reprehensible conduct by the Minister leading up to the assessment, such as abuse of power or unfairness[...] If an assessment is correct on the facts and the law, the taxpayer is liable for the tax. [Footnote 13 reads: Ibid at paragraph 83. In Ereiser, see paragraphs 36 and 37. Leroux v Canada (Revenue Agency), 2012 BCCA 63, example of tort action in the British Columbia Superior Court. In J.P. Morgan, various causes of action are detailed at paragraph 89 noting recourse is available in the provincial superior courts or possibly the Federal Court\u2019s judicial review process depending on the issue.\nIII. Conclusion\n[46] The submissions of the Respondent, both written as set out in the Reply and oral advanced at the hearing, are sound in light of the analysis set out above and are adopted by the Court. The Appeal framed by the Appellant involves a subject matter that is beyond the jurisdiction of the Court and the Appeal is quashed.\n[47] No costs were sought and no costs are awarded.\nSigned Ottawa, Canada this 27th day of March 2023.\n\u201cGilles Renaud\u201d\nRenaud D.J.\nDeputy Judge Renaud\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 27\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-1576(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nHEIDI MELENCHUK AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nRegina , Saskatchewan\nDATE OF HEARING:\nFebruary 8, 2023\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Gilles Renaud, Deputy Judge\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nMarch 27th, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant herself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nSteven Tymiak\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nThe Appellant herself\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nSteven Tymiak Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n",

Introduction:\n[1] The appellant, Marlene Enns (Mrs. Enns) appeals her assessment raised April 12, 2017 in respect of paragraph 160(1)(a) of the federal Income Tax Act (Act). Upon objection the assessment was confirmed October 25, 2018.\nII. Factual Background:\n[2] At the hearing the parties filed an \u201cagreed statement of facts and exhibits\u201d (Exhibit 1). No witnesses were called.\n[3] In essence the agreed facts reflect that Mrs. Enns\u2019 then husband Peter Enns passed away May 22, 2013, leaving her as his widow. He was the sole annuitant of a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and had designated her as sole beneficiary of that RRSP. Mrs. Enns tendered no consideration for this designation.\n[4] Accordingly, some time following Mr. Enns\u2019 death the $102,789.52 fair market value of the subject RRSP was paid out to Mrs. Enns. (She then transferred the funds into her locked-in retirement account.)\n[5] On April 12, 2017 when the appealed assessment was raised, Mr. Enns\u2019 estate had an income tax liability of $146,382.05, harkening back to Mr. Enns\u2019 2004 through 2012 taxation years.\nIII. Statutory Provision:\n[6] Paragraph 160(1)(a) of the Act provides in relevant part:\n160(1) Tax liability re property transferred not at arm\u2019s length - Where a person has, on or after May 1, 1951, transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to:\n(a) the person\u2019s spouse or common law partner or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common law partner\u2026the following rules apply\u2026 (underlining added)\nIV. Issue:\n[7] Mrs. Enns asserts that upon Mr. Enns\u2019 death, when entitlement to the RRSP funds transferred to her, she ceased being his \u201cspouse\u201d (instead becoming his widow). The issue in this matter is whether that is so; that is, upon Mr. Enns\u2019 death, did Mrs. Enns cease to be his \u201cspouse\u201d for purposes of paragraph 160(1)(a). Re-stated, does the term \u201cspouse\u201d in paragraph 160(1)(a) include the widow(er) of a transferor tax debtor?\n[8] The respondent Crown\u2019s position is that upon Mr. Enns\u2019 death the term \u201cspouse\u201d in paragraph 160(1)(a) did still apply to Mrs. Enns.\nV. Analysis:\n[9] Two recent decisions of this Court have addressed the meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d in paragraph 160(1)(a). The first is Kiperchuk v. R., 2013 TCC 60.\n[10] In Kiperchuk, Lamarre, J. as she then was, considered circumstances substantively the same as herein. The learned judge concluded (paras. 25 and 26):\n25. Assuming that the transferor is the former husband, he was not related to the appellant [wife] by marriage at the time she became entitled to the RRSP. Indeed, the status of marriage is ended by death or by a decree absolute of divorce\u2026\n26. Therefore, the appellant was not related by marriage to her former husband at the time of the transfer [upon his death], as she was no longer his spouse\u2026. (underlining added)\n[11] In Kiperchuk, the question as to the meaning of the term \u201cspouse\u201d in paragraph 160(1)(a) was not specifically posed. Nonetheless, as set out above, it was specifically answered \u2013 a marriage is ended by death, and the spouse of the husband, upon his death, is no longer his spouse. Thus, with the (former) wife, upon her husband\u2019s death and thus the end of their marriage, no longer being his wife\/spouse, the section 160 assessment against the former wife was found to be invalid. The decision was not appealed.\n[12] The more recent of the two decisions is Kuchta v. R., 2015 TCC 289. In Kuchta, again the core facts were substantively the same as in Kiperchuk, and herein. In Kuchta, colleague Graham J. engaged in a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to interpret the term \u201cspouse\u201d as it is used in paragraph 160(1)(a). That is the statutory interpretation analysis that the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. R., 2005 SCC 54.\n[13] In Canada Trustco the Supreme Court, in introducing this new analytical approach to statutory interpretation, expressed the guiding principles as follows (paras. 10-13):\n10. It has been long established as a matter of statutory interpretation that \u201cthe words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d [citation]. The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases, the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\n11. There is no doubt today that all statutes, including the [Income Tax] Act, must be interpreted in a textual, contextual and purposive way. However, the particularity and detail of many tax provisions have often led to an emphasis on textual interpretation. Where Parliament has specified precisely what conditions must be satisfied to achieve a particular result, it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended that taxpayers would rely on such provisions to achieve the result they prescribe.\n12. The provisions of the Income Tax Act must be interpreted in order to achieve consistency, predictability and fairness so that taxpayers can manage their affairs intelligently.\u2026 See also 65302 British Columbia, at para. 51, per Iacobucci J. citing P.W. Hogg and J.E. Magee, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (2nd ed. 1997) at pp. 475-76:\nIt would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the Income Tax Act if clear language in a detailed provision of the Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court\u2019s view of the object and purpose of the provision.\n13. The Income Tax Act remains an instrument dominated by explicit provisions dictating specific consequences, inviting a largely textual interpretation. Onto this compendium of detailed stipulations, Parliament has engrafted quite a different sort of provision, the GAAR. This is a broadly drafted provision, intended to negate arrangements that would be permissible under a literal interpretation of other provisions of the Income Tax Act, on the basis that they amount to abusive tax avoidance. (underlining added)\n[14] In Kuchta, applying the Canada Trustco \u201ctextual, contextual, purposive\u201d interpretive analysis, Graham J. found as to the textual component that \u201cspouse\u201d in the marital context meant a living person\u2019s husband or wife. The Court found also that there was a \u201ccolloquial\u201d aspect to the term, insofar as on occasion the term \u201cspouse\u201d was used to refer to persons who through death of their marital partners were widows or widowers of the deceased. The Court concluded, taking into account this colloquial meaning, that textually the word \u201cspouse\u201d was used ambiguously.\n[15] Then turning to the contextual component of the Canada Trustco analysis, the Court identified four provisions in the Act, dealing with death, that employed the term \u201cspouse\u201d as being inclusive of a deceased\u2019s spouse at time of death, i.e. as in the aforesaid colloquial sense. The four provisions were subsections 70(6), 72(2), 146(8.2) and 146(8.91). But other provisions (e.g., subsections 146(1) \u201crefund of premiums\u201d, 146(5.1), 248(23.1) and 147.3(7)) meant \u201cspouse\u201d only in the legal or literal sense, i.e. of a living person. Thus the context factor was found indeterminative.\n[16] Lastly, turning to the purposive factor, the Court found no legislative intention or policy reason to exclude widows and widowers as RRSP beneficiaries from application of paragraph 160(1)(a). For the Court this broke the textual and contextual \u201ctie\u201d and led to the conclusion that a paragraph 160(1)(a) \u201cspouse\u201d did include widows and widowers; that is, spouses continued to be spouses subsequent to the death of the other spouse.\n[17] Additionally, at the conclusion of his Kuchta analysis, Graham, J. provided clarifying comments (at para. 78), referring to the above-noted subsections 70(6), 72(2), 146(8.2) and 146(8.91) in which the word \u201cspouse\u201d clearly incorporated the concepts of widow and widower:\n78. Had Parliament consistently used the legal meaning of the word \u201cspouse\u201d throughout the Act, then, despite existence of the colloquial meaning of the word and the fact that the purposive analysis strongly supports that meaning, I would not have found that the word \u201cspouse\u201d in subsection 160(1) includes widows and widowers. The use of additional language in provisions such as subsection 146(8.8) to specifically include widows and widowers, would have convinced me that there was no textual ambiguity to the word \u201cspouse\u201d in subsection 160(1)\u2026 (underlining added)\n[18] As Graham J. said, but for the above-referenced four provisions of the Act in which Parliament used the term \u201cspouse\u201d as clearly inclusive of the concepts of widow and widower, he would have stayed with the strict textual interpretation, being the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cspouse\u201d, requiring a living partner.\n[19] Thus in Kuchta the Court concluded that the appellant, being the widow of the deceased husband, also remained his \u201cspouse\u201d for purposes of paragraph 160(1)(a). Accordingly the appealed section 160 assessment was found valid.\n[20] There is another aspect of Kuchta to be considered. That appeal was originally assigned to and heard by my colleague Jorre, J. After some passage of time without a decision, the Court\u2019s Chief Justice re-assigned the matter to Graham, J., who in due course rendered his decision as summarized above, based on the parties\u2019 agreement that he do so, utilizing transcripts and the court record, plus at the judge\u2019s request hearing supplemental oral submissions of the parties. The Kuchta decision was not appealed.\n[21] However, subsequently, in High-Crest Enterprises Ltd. v. R., 2017 FCA 88, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) addressed a similar judge substitution situation, although in the context of a completely different tax issue. A majority of the appellate panel found the substitute judge\u2019s decision to be a \u201cnullity\u201d, and that judgment should instead be rendered by the original judge who was seized of the matter and had heard it.\n[22] In light of High-Crest, Kuchta now is sometimes questioned as to whether it is similarly a nullity. But as the Kuchta decision was not appealed, there is no apparent prospect of any like appellate pronouncement.\n[23] In the present matter, the respondent Crown relies primarily on Kuchta, urging that the analysis is strong and that Kuchta has not been labelled a nullity and thus I should apply the principle of judicial comity in accepting and following it. The respondent critiques Kiperchuk as it did not address the specific question as to meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d as did Kuchta and which likewise is the issue before me.\n[24] Also, in oral submissions respondent\u2019s counsel confirmed agreement with the appellant that the relevant property, being entitlement to the late Mr. Enn\u2019s RRSP funds, was transferred upon Mr. Enns\u2019 death, rather than at any earlier or later time.\n[25] Appellant\u2019s counsel favourably cites Kiperchuk, discussed above, in which the Court found that the capacity of \u201cspouse\u201d in the context of subsection 160(1)(a), ends upon death of the marital partner and thus excludes a widow(er) of the deceased marital partner.\n[26] Appellant\u2019s counsel cited also the 2000 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Will\u2011Kare Paving & Contracting Ltd. v. R., 2000 SCC 36. In Will\u2011Kare, the Court considered the meaning of the common term \u201csale\u201d in the Act. The majority (per Major J.) found that term to have an established and accepted legal meaning which should be used as its meaning for purposes of the Act, rather than any broader meaning derived from general usage. The distinction drawn was asphalt sold as a specific item (through contracts for sale of asphalt per se) and asphalt being sold as one of several materials required in the course of completing a paving contract (i.e. a contract for work and materials).\n[27] The Will-Kare principle, as identified by appellant\u2019s counsel, was a 2016 statement by the the Supreme Court of Canada statement (post Canada Trustco), which cited Will-Kare in stating that, \u201c[w]ords that have a well-understood legal meaning when used in a statute should be given that meaning unless Parliament clearly indicates otherwise.\u201d [1]\n[28] Also the appellant quotes from Will-Kare regarding the Act, that, \u201c[t]he technical nature of the Act does not lend itself to broadening the principle of plain meaning to embrace popular meaning.\u201d [2]\n[29] The appellant critiques the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive\u201d interpretive analysis in Kuchta. The textual analysis is said to have been overly reaching to include widows and widowers in the \u201cspouse\u201d concept, such references being only metaphorically expressed, such as at funerals.\n[30] The Kuchta contextual analysis is criticized also for not recognizing any contextual element of paragraph 160(1)(a) itself. That provision extends the \u201cspouse\u201d concept in one direction (i.e., subsequent spouse) while, significantly, not in the other direction (i.e., former spouse). This is said to be indicative of intentional exclusion of the persons who were spouses immediately prior to time of death, i.e. widow(er)s, being Mrs. Enns\u2019 situation.\n[31] The appellant cites also a Supreme Court of Canada statement in Friesen v. R, 1995 CarswellNat 422 (SCC), at para. 41:\nIt is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that the court should not accept an interpretation which requires the insertion of extra wording where there is another acceptable interpretation which does not require any additional wording. Reading extra words into a statutory definition is even less acceptable when the phrases which must be read in appear in several other definitions in the same statute.\n[32] In citing Friesen I understand the appellant to be critiquing Kuchta for implicitly inserting extra wording such that the scope of the term \u201cspouse\u201d in subparagraph 160(1)(a) is inclusive of widow(er)s.\n[33] The appellant cites also the Supreme Court in Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51 at para. 41, in stating:\n[T]he particularity and detail of many provisions, along with the Duke of Westminster principle\u2026 lead us to focus carefully on the text and context in assessing the broader purpose of the scheme. This approach is particularly apposite in this case, where the provision at issue is part of the highly detailed and precise FAPI regime. I must emphasize again that this is not a case involving a general anti-avoidance rule. The provision at issue is part of an exception to the definition of \u201cinvestment business\u201d within the highly intricate, highly defined FAPI regime. If taxpayers are to act with any degree of certainty under such a regime, then full effect should be given to Parliament\u2019s precise and unequivocal words.\n[34] I find this Loblaw extract not particularly persuasive in respect of the present matter, the statutory complexity of which is not comparable to, as in Loblaw, \u201cthe highly intricate, highly defined FAPI regime\u201d.\n[35] The appellant asserts that the respondent Crown\u2019s position (extended meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d) should be addressed legislatively rather than via the judicial route. The appellant argues also that greater uncertainty is created by Kuchta with respect to the meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d elsewhere in the Act, if one has to apply a textual, contextual and purposive analysis test for other \u201cspouse\u201d provisions. The word appears frequently throughout the Act.\n[36] In Kuchta, Graham, J. rendered an extensive, well-constructed and thought\u2011out analysis in addressing the same legal issue as now before me. The decision with its full analysis exists and is published. I do not think the prospect that the decision could be a nullity (and whether it is, is not for me to say) prevents me from considering it.\n[37] Even were Kuchta a nullity, the decision itself exists. The decision if a nullity would be of no legal effect, albeit due to circumstances unrelated to the merits of Graham J.\u2019s legal analysis.\n[38] Whereas Kuchta is a decision of this Court addressing the identical legal issue now before me, I consider that I should have regard for the principle of judicial comity.\n[39] The principle of judicial comity would apply in my consideration of a legal issue that a Court colleague has analyzed and pronounced upon.\n[40] My colleague Boyle J. addressed the principle of judicial comity in Houda International Inc. v. Her Majesty, 2010 TCC 622, writing (paras. 22, 25):\n22. Stare decisis does not apply with respect to decisions of courts of coordinate jurisdiction. That being said, according to the doctrine of judicial comity, reasoned judgments of such courts or judges should be deferred to, in the absence of exceptional circumstances.\n25. In Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999], F.C.J. No. 1008 (F.C.T.D.), it is written:\nIn Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare), supra, Richard, J. (as he then was) considered whether he was bound by reasons of judicial comity, to apply a decision of Noel, J. (as he then was) on one of the identical issues raised before him. In reviewing the principle of judicial comity and its application, Richard, J. stated as follows:\nThe principle of judicial comity has been expressed as follows:\nThe generally accepted view is that this court is bound to follow a previous decision of the court unless it can be shown that the previous decision was manifestly wrong, or should no longer be followed: for example, (1) the decision failed to consider legislation or binding authorities which would have produced a different result, or (2) the decision, if followed, would result in a severe injustice. The reason generally assigned for this approach is a judicial comity. While doubtless this is a fundamental reason for the approach, I think that an equally fundamental, if not more compelling, reason is the need for certainty in the law, so far as that can be established. Lawyers would be in an intolerable position in advising clients if a division of the court was free to decide an appeal without regard to a previous decision, or the principle involved in it.\nA similar position was taken by Mr. Justice Jackett, President of the Exchequer Court, in Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1966] Ex.C.R. 972 at p. 976, [1966] C.T.C. 255, 66 D.T.C. 5205:\nI think I am bound to approach the matter in the same way as the similar problem was approached in each of these cases until such time, if any, as a different course is indicated by a higher Court. When I say I am bound, I do not mean that I am bound by any strict rule of stare decisis but by my own view as to the desirability of having the decisions of this Court follow a consistent course, as far as possible.\nIn R. v. Northern Electric Co. (1955) 24 C.P.R. 1 at p. 19, [1955] 3 D.L.R. 449, [1955] O.R. 431 (H.C.), McRuer, C.J.H.C. stated:\nHaving regard to all the rights of appeal that now exist in Ontario, I think Hogg J. stated the right common law principle to be applied in his judgment in R. v. ex rel. McWilliam v. Morris, [1942] O.W.N. 447 where he said: \u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis is one long recognized as a principle of our law. Sir Frederick Pollock says, in his First Book of Jurisprudence, 6th ed., p. 312: \u2018The decisions of an ordinary superior court are binding on all courts of inferior rank within the same jurisdiction, and, though not absolutely binding on courts of co-ordinate authority nor on that court itself, will be followed in the absence of strong reason to the contrary\u2019.\u201c\nI think that \u201cstrong reason to the contrary\u201d does not mean a strong argumentative reason appealing to the particular Judge, but something that may indicate that the prior decision was given without consideration of a statute or some authority that ought to have been followed. I do not think \u201cstrong reason to the contrary\u201d is to be construed according to the flexibility of the mind of the particular Judge. (underlining added)\n[41] In considering this judicial guidance respecting judicial comity, I conclude - whether or not Kuchta is a nullity, and if it is whether or not the principle of judicial comity applies - that the Kuchta analysis does not, \u201c[fail] to consider legislation or binding authorities which would [produce] a different result.\u201d Nor would Kuchta, if followed, \u201cresult in a severe injustice.\u201d\n[42] I consider that appellant\u2019s counsel argued his brief well, including citing several significant Supreme Court of Canada decisions as noted above, in favour of a textual approach in deciding the legal question. Nevertheless, I believe Graham, J. properly and diligently applied the textual, contextual and purposive analysis specified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada Trustco in construing the meaning to be ascribed the term \u201cspouse\u201d in paragraph 160(1)(a) of the Act.\n[43] The guiding principles provided by the Supreme Court in Canada Trustco for applying that three part interpretive analysis are set out above at paragraph 13. They recognize the challenge in joining a textual meaning with context and purpose such that the particular statute may be read harmoniously as a whole. Justice Graham provided as well, reflection in his Kuchta decision (set out in part at paragraph 17 above), as to how he balanced these three Canada Trustco factors, in concluding that an entirely textual and literal meaning of \u201cspouse\u201d ought not to govern.\nVI. Conclusion:\n[44] The appeal will be dismissed, with costs to the respondent. Failing the parties\u2019 agreement as to quantum of costs, they are directed to file with the Court submissions as to costs within 30 days of the judgment date.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 8th day of March 2023.\n\u201cB.

Mr. Goldhar and his business colleagues utilized complex corporate structures for the toy businesses they carried on, which included corporations and partnerships in Canada, the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) and Hong Kong. As a result of information obtained from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Offshore Compliance Specialized Team of the Canada Revenue Agency conducted an audit of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2006 to 2013 taxation years, following which the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) issued the following Notices of Reassessment under the Income Tax Act [1] (the \u201cAct\u201d) to the Appellant in respect of his 2008 to 2011 taxation years:\na) Notices of Reassessment dated November 20, 2017, pursuant to which the Minister reassessed the Appellant in respect of $5,555,021 of unreported benefits as follows:\nfor the 2008 taxation year, the Minister reassessed the Appellant to include additional income of $3,032,271 based on the following:\nbenefits from shares in the amount of $601,685;\nbenefits of warrants in the amount of $93,774;\nunreported cash advances totaling $2,000,537; and\ncash conferred on others totalling $336,275; and\nfor the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years, the Minister reassessed the Appellant to include the following amounts as unreported income on the basis that these amounts represented cash conferred on others: $1,316,399, $1,190,262 and $16,089, respectively; and\nb) Notices of Reassessment dated July 7, 2017, pursuant to which the Minister assessed penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) and paragraphs 162(7)(a), 162(10)(a), 162(10.1)(f) and 163(2.4)(d) of the Act, amounting to approximately $1,271,946.90.\n[2] Mr. Goldhar has appealed these Reassessments on the basis that they are, inter alia, all statute barred. He also disputes the correctness of the Reassessments on the basis that the amounts in dispute do not represent income in his hands. He also disputes the application of all of the aforementioned penalties on the basis, inter alia, that he exercised due diligence in filing all of his tax returns for the taxation years in dispute. These appeals were heard together on common evidence.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the appeals should be allowed with respect to both the amounts included in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s income and the penalties imposed.\nISSUES\n[4] The issues in these appeals are as follows:\na) Whether the Minister correctly reassessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years to include unreported shareholder benefits of $3,032,271, $1,316,399, $1,190,262 and $16,089, respectively;\nb) Whether the Minister correctly reassessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act;\nc) Whether the Minister properly assessed penalties in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years pursuant to subsection l63(2) of the Act; and\nd) Whether the Minister correctly applied penalties in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years pursuant to paragraphs 162(7)(a), 162(10)(a), 162(10.1)(f) and 163(2.4)(d) of the Act.\nEVIDENCE\n[5] The parties collectively called the following five witnesses during the hearing of these appeals:\na) David Goldhar, the Appellant;\nb) Marilyn Goldhar, the Appellant\u2019s spouse;\nc) Richard Yanofsky, a former business colleague of the Appellant;\nd) Mark Pelchovitz, one of the Appellant\u2019s accountants during the taxation years in dispute; and\ne) Scott Robinson, a CRA auditor.\n[6] The parties submitted a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d). The parties also submitted a 17 volume Joint Book of Documents [2] containing some 241 tabs and 5172 pages of documents. The Appellant also submitted two excerpts from the examination for discovery of Scott Robinson. [3]\n[7] Following is a summary of the evidence submitted in these appeals.\n(i) The Partial Agreed Statements of Facts\n[8] In the PASF, the parties admitted the following facts in respect of these appeals: [4]\n30. Mr. David Goldhar is an individual taxpayer residing in the province of Ontario with his wife Mrs. Marilyn Goldhar (Mrs. Goldhar\u201d). He has lived in Ontario with Mrs. Goldhar throughout the entire period relevant to this appeal.\n11. The Appellant was a Canadian resident at all relevant times.\n31. WowWee Hong Kong (\u201cWowWee\u201d) was part of an international toy manufacturing business, primarily based in China.\n32. At the time, the Appellant served as part of WowWee\u2019s senior management team, as Director of Sales and Marketing.\n33. Beanteek Enterprises Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands in March of 2006.\n13. With the exception of the initial corporate director, the Appellant was one of four directors of Beanteek, three of which were at all material times non-residents of Canada for income tax purposes.\n34. Beanteek initially had a corporate director, but immediately following its incorporation appointed the following four individual directors:\na) David Goldhar;\nb) Tsee Yee Tang Kennedy;\nc) Eric Tung Ching Lau; and\nd) Peter Yanofsky.\n35. The initial sole shareholder of Beanteek was \u201c4307836 Canada Inc., a holding corporation of which the Appellant held all shares and was the sole director.\n15. On or about the 12th day of September 2006, the shares of Beanteek were transferred to the Appellant.\n36. On September 12, 2006, David [Goldhar] transferred his shares of RPA [(Rich Point Asia)] to Beanteek pursuant to subsection 85.1(3) of the Act.\n37. In exchange, the Appellant received 7,999,900 shares of Beanteek, placing the total number of shares of Beanteek outstanding at 8,000,000, of which the Appellant was the sole owner.\n38. In December 2007, WowWee disposed of its assets in a transaction to Optimal Group Inc. (herein referred to as \u201cOptimal\u201d) in exchange for a combination of cash, as well as Optimal shares and warrants.\n16. In December 2007, as a result of the series of transactions, a dividend was declared to Beanteek in the form of US$2,964,000 cash, and US$606,110 and $94,464 in shares and warrants, respectively, of the Optimal Group (\u201cOptimal\u201d) arising from the sale of the assets of WowWee Inc.\n18. The Optimal share certificates and warrants were issued in the Appellant\u2019s name, not Beanteek\u2019s.\n40. The Minister included the following in the 2008 Notice of Reassessment issued to the Appellant:\na) $601,685.40 representing the Canadian value of the Optimal shares; and\nb) $93,774.41 representing the Canadian value of the Optimal warrants.\n41. In addition, between 2008 and 2013, Beanteek transferred cash from its own accounts to a variety of individuals or entities that were connected to this entity.\n17. From 2008 through to 2011, funds in the following amounts: CAD$2,336,812, $1,316,399, $1,190,262, and $16,089 were withdrawn from the accounts registered to Beanteek.\n42. On January 9, 2009, 2010 Ltd. deposited $1,218,520 CAD into Beanteek\u2019s accounts.\n43. On March 24, 2011, WowWee deposited $536,084.04 into Beanteek\u2019s account.\n44. The Minister considered both of the above deposits in assessing the 2009 and 2010 tax years, which brought down value of \u201ccash conferred on others\u201d in the respective taxation year.\n29. During the preceding taxation years, the Appellant reported the following on his income tax returns:\nYear\nGross Income\nNet Income\n2006\n$1,299,000\n$1,281,000\n2005\n$287,000\n$271,000\n2004\n$256,000\n$245,000\n2003\n$289,000\n$266,000\n2002\n$439,000\n$407,000\n2001\n$234,000\n$194,000\n2000\n$123,000\n$117,000\n19. The Appellant acquired one registered share of 2010 Limited, a corporation resident in the BVI, on January 15, 2009.\n20. The Appellant was a shareholder of 2010 Limited after January 2009.\n21. The Appellant was also a shareholder of Goldmount Marketing Inc. (\u201cGoldmount\u201d) after October 20, 2011.\n22. The Appellant was aware of the existence of 2010 Ltd, Goldmount and\/or Goldy Group during the relevant periods.\n23. The T1134 Foreign Reporting Forms prepared and filed by the Appellant\u2019s representative at Schwartz Feldman LLP, in respect of his 2008 taxation year, included incomplete information in respect of Beanteek.\n24. The Appellant retained a new accounting firm, mainly Truster Zweig LLP, at some point in 2009.\n25. The Appellant\u2019s accountant at Truster Zweig LLP did not file the required T1134 Foreign Reporting Forms for the 2009 taxation year for Beanteek or 2010 Ltd.\n26. The Appellant\u2019s then representative prepared and filed a T1134 Foreign Reporting Form in respect of Beanteek, but did not include information pertaining to 2010 Ltd. as part of the Appellant\u2019s 2010 income tax filings.\n27. The T1134 Foreign Reporting Forms prepared and filed by the Appellant\u2019s representative in respect of his 2010 taxation year included inaccurate information in respect of Beanteek.\n28. The Appellant satisfied his foreign reporting obligation in the 2011 taxation year for both foreign affiliates, that being Beanteek and 2010 Ltd.\n1. The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) initially assessed the Appellant for the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years on May 7, 2009, April 29, 2010, June 6, 2011 and April 30, 2012, respectively in accordance with the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n2. During the years at issue, the Appellant\u2019s income tax returns were prepared and filed by a Chartered Professional Accountant.\n3. The Appellant retained a number of accounting firms during the years at issue, including: Dacks & Levine, Chartered Accountants, Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP, and Truster Zweig LLP. These firms were Chartered Professional Accountants who were charged with the responsibilities of preparing and filing the Appellant\u2019s income tax returns, foreign reporting forms and related corporate tax returns.\n4. On or about the 1st day of August, 2014, the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) Audit Division (Offshore Compliance Department) sent the Appellant and audit questionnaire.\n5. On or about the 7th day of July, 2017 [this should read November 20, 2017] [5] , the Minister issued Notices of Reassessment to the Appellant for:\na) the 2008 year the Minister reassessed the Appellant to include additional income of $3,032,271 based on the following: \u201cBenefits from Shares\u201d in the amount of $601,685; \u201cBenefits of Warrants\u201d in the amount of $93,774; \u201cUnreported Cash Advances\u201d totaling $2,000,537; and \u201cCash Conferred on Others\u201d by $336,275, totaling an income inclusion of $3,032,271; and\nb) for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years to include the following amounts as unreported income: \u2026 $1,316,399, $1,190,262 and $16,089, respectively on the basis that these figures represented cash conferred on others.\n6. The Auditor did not conduct an interview with the Appellant or third parties in the course of conducting his audit, including his wife, his accountants and the legal professionals involved at the time.\n7. No information was obtained from non-Canadian tax authorities other then the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n8. On or about the 20th day of November, 2017 [this should read July 7, 2017] [6] , the Minister also assessed penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2), and paragraphs 162(7)(a), 162(10)(a), 162(10.1)(f) and 163(2.4)(d) of the Act, amounting to approximately $1,271,946.90.\n(ii) David Goldhar\u2019s Testimony\n[9] Mr. Goldhar testified at the hearing of this appeal. I found Mr. Goldhar to be a credible witness.\n[10] Mr. Goldhar testified that he graduated from high school with a diploma and then briefly went to Seneca College for business administration. He did not obtain any degrees, certificates or obtain any other qualifications. He also did not take any tax courses. After attending Seneca College, Mr. Goldhar went into the carpet business for seven years, eventually becoming a store manager. He then went into the gift business for seven years, becoming a sales manager and then a regional manager.\n[11] Mr. Goldhar then entered the toy business, partnering with and doing joint ventures with various others, including Peter Yanofsky and Richard Yanofsky from Montreal. After developing several successful products, they formed WowWee, which was eventually sold in 2000 to Hasbro. Mr. Goldhar worked with Hasbro for three years, during which WowWee\u2019s sales faltered. Mr. Goldhar and his partners then repurchased WowWee from Hasbro and built the company back up, following which they sold WowWee to a company called Optimal Group. Mr. Goldhar then worked for Optimal for a period of time, after which he entered into a partnership named Gillyboo Group with a friend, Lenny Gelbard. After exiting Gillyboo, Mr. Goldhar formed the Goldy Toys Partnership with Bobby Stewart.\n[12] Mr. Goldhar testified that his spouse, Marilyn Goldhar, helped him by looking after his accounting and tax affairs for the taxation years at issue in these appeals. He further testified that he hired professional accountants and lawyers to look after all of his legal and tax affairs, and his accountants filed all of his tax returns. Marilyn Goldhar provided the lawyers and accountants with all of the information they required. Mr. Goldhar testified that he would review his tax returns with his accountants before they were filed each year.\n[13] Following is a summary of other background information from Mr. Goldhar\u2019s testimony:\na) Kennedy Tang in Hong Kong looked after the accounting for WowWee Hong Kong and Beanteek Enterprises Inc.\nb) The Yanofskys\u2019 accountants looked after the accounting for WowWee Canada.\nc) Mr. Goldhar\u2019s accountants looked after filing all of his tax returns. He used Jerry Pinkas at Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP, Steven Levine from Dacks & Levine, and Mark Pelchowitz at Truster Zweig LLP.\nd) Mr. Goldhar\u2019s corporate structure for his ownership interest in WowWee and its eventual sale in 2007 was set up under the instructions of Richard Yanofsky and with the assistance of the Yanofskys\u2019 accountants, Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP, and their lawyers at Yanofsky Mancuso Et Associ\u00e9s.\ne) Mr. Goldhar invested money back into each of the toy businesses he was involved with. In addition, Mr. Goldhar testified that intercorporate loans within his corporate group were used to finance his business operations.\n(iii) Marilyn Goldhar\u2019s Testimony\n[14] Marilyn Goldhar testified at the hearing of this appeal. I found Ms. Goldhar to be a credible witness.\n[15] Ms. Goldhar testified that she has been a dental hygienist for over 40 years. She has not worked in any other industries, and does not have an accounting background. She testified that beginning in 2006, when Mr. Goldhar was travelling more to Hong Kong for his wok with WowWee, which was doing quite well, he needed someone to take care of his day to day affairs, including dealing with his accountants and lawyers. As a result, she agreed to reduce her work hours as a dental hygienist so that she could help Mr. Goldhar with his financial affairs.\n[16] Ms. Goldhar testified that she communicated frequently with Mr. Goldhar\u2019s lawyers and accountants, and obtained all of the documentation they required and requested.\n(iv) Richard Yanofsky\u2019s Testimony\n[17] Richard Yanofsky testified at the hearing of this appeal. While I found Mr. Yanofsky to be a credible witness, because of the passage of time and his lack of familiarity with all of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s affairs, I found some of his responses to be vague.\n[18] Mr. Yanofsky testified that he is a businessman and graduated from McGill University, where he studied investor relations and economics. He also has a year of post-graduate studies in management. He does not have any experience or formal training in tax or accounting.\n[19] Mr. Yanofsky testified that he first met Mr. Goldhar in the early 1990s when Mr. Goldhar began working with WowWee Canada and WowWee Hong Kong. WowWee Canada primarily undertook the sales function for WowWee Group, which was a Hong Kong company. Mr. Goldhar was instrumental in soliciting and driving those sales. Over time, Mr. Goldhar moved from being an employee to a minority shareholder of WowWee.\n[20] Mr. Yanofsky testified that WowWee was first sold to Hasbro in around the year 2000, following which Mr. Goldhar continued on as an employee of Hasbro selling the WowWee products. In around 2003 or 2004, the WowWee management group repurchased WowWee (or its assets) from Hasbro. Mr. Goldhar continued working in his sales function with WowWee after the repurchase. Mr. Goldhar\u2019s ownership interest was approximately 6%. Because of the cost of financing the repurchase, they brought Francis Choi in as a partner at that time. They also relied on self-financing, including intercompany loans.\n[21] Mr. Yanofsky further testified that they sold WowWee a second time in the second half of 2007 to the Optimal Group. They used lawyers and accountants in Canada and Hong Kong to advise them and to structure the sale. The advisors included Kennedy Tang in Hong Kong, PSB in Montreal and Charles Spector of Dentons. Mr. Yanofsky was actively involved in meeting with their various legal and accounting advisors in structuring the second sale of WowWee.\n[22] After the WowWee sale to the Optimal Group, Mr. Goldhar continued to work for the Optimal Group in his WowWee sales function until approximately 2009 or 2010.\n(v) Mark Pelchovitz\u2019s Testimony\n[23] Mark Pelchovitz testified at the hearing of this appeal. I found Mr. Pelchovitz to be a credible witness.\n[24] Mr. Pelchovitz testified that he is a CA\/CPA which he obtained in 1983. Lenny Gelbard was a client of his, and when Mr. Gelbard and Mr. Goldhar decided to form the Gillyboo Group partnership with their respective spouses, he became the accountant for Mr. Goldhar as well. Mr. Pelchovitz practices with Truster Zweig LLP.\n[25] Mr. Pelchovitz testified that he met with Mr. Goldhar and Mr. Gelbard to design a structure for the Gillyboo Group partnership, which was registered in 2010. The structure was designed by Perry Truster of his firm, and included two corporations for each of the 4 partners, for a total of 8 corporations. The corporations were formed by the parties legal counsel. Mr. Pelchovitz prepared and filed the 2009, 2010, 2011 and subsequent tax returns for the Goldhars as well as the corporate tax returns for their corporations. Mr. Pelchovitz testified that he stopped working for the Goldhars in approximately 2014 or 2015.\n(vi) Scott Robinson\u2019s Testimony\n[26] Scott Robinson testified at the hearing of this appeal. I found Mr. Robinson to be a credible witness.\n[27] Mr. Robinson testified that he has a Bachelor of Business Administration from Wilfred Laurier University, a Bachelor of Education from Western University and a CMA\/CPA designation. He is currently employed as an auditor in the CRA offshore compliance division. Prior to that, he was an auditor in the small to medium enterprises division, which entailed working with large personal income tax returns and small corporate income tax returns. Prior to that, he was in the CRA collections department. Overall, he has been with the CRA since 1993.\n[28] Mr. Robinson testified that the CRA\u2019s audit of Mr. Goldhar was initiated after it received information from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that the Appellant was the sole shareholder of a British Virgin Island corporation. As a result, an initial audit questionnaire was sent out by the CRA to Mr. Goldhar on or about August 1, 2014. The CRA\u2019s audit related to Mr. Goldhars 2006 to 2013 taxation years and continued until 2017 when Reassessments were issued on July 7, 2017 and November 20, 2017 in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years. The other taxation years were not Reassessed and are not before this Court.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\n[29] As noted above, there are four issues in these appeals. The first two issues will be dealt with together, after which the remaining two issues will be dealt with. An underlying issue, which is to an extent common to all of the issues, is the degree of care which Mr. Goldhar, with the assistance of Ms. Goldhar, took in addressing his tax filing obligations during his 2008 to 2011 taxation years.\n(i) Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) - Statute Barred Years and Unreported Income\n[30] As noted above, the first two issues in these appeals are:\na) Whether the Minister correctly reassessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years to include unreported shareholder benefits of $3,032,271, $1,316,399, $1,190,262 and $16,089, respectively; and\nb) Whether the Minister correctly reassessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act.\n[31] For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the Minister did not correctly include unreported shareholder benefits in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years on the basis that the Minister could not reassess those taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period and, in the alternative, on the basis that the Minister incorrectly computed the amount of those benefits.\n[32] In this case, the Minister reassessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act, which provides as follows:\n(4) Assessment and reassessment [limitation period] \u2014 The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer's normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or \u2026\n[Emphasis added]\n[33] In this case, the Minister has not alleged fraud, but rather has alleged that Mr. Goldhar made misrepresentations in each of his 2008 to 2011 taxation years that were attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. As has been held in numerous cases, the Minister has the onus of proving the alleged misrepresentations in each of those taxation years, and must also prove that the misrepresentations were attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. [7]\n[34] I will first address the issue of whether the Minister has established that the alleged misrepresentations occurred in the four taxation years under appeal. In this respect, I note that the Minister reassessed Mr. Goldhar on the basis that he failed to report the amounts set out in Appendix A in his 2008 to 2011 taxation years. [8] For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the Minister has not established that all of the alleged misrepresentations were made in the taxation years under appeal herein.\n[35] Notwithstanding the PASF, 5 witnesses and 17 volumes of exhibits proffered as evidence at trial, the Court was left with conflicting evidence and an unclear picture of the transactions undertaken by Mr. Goldhar and his various corporate entities during the taxation years under appeal. In essence, the Minister alleges that all of the funds withdrawn from Beanteek during the period 2008 to 2011 where shareholder benefits. Mr. Goldhar argues that he and Ms. Goldhar had advanced funds to Beanteek, and the various transfers were intercorporate transfers within their corporate group and\/or repayments of corporate loans they had made. I note that the evidence supports Mr. Goldhar\u2019s position with respect to some of the transfers. I also note that the evidence indicates that the Minister assessed Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years for amounts that were not benefits during those taxation years.\n[36] With respect to Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 taxation year, the first three items listed by the Minister are (i) Benefit of Shares, (ii) Benefit of Warrants and (iii) Unreported Cash advances. All three of these purported benefits relate to the 2007 sale of WowWee. In this respect, paragraphs 16-18 of the PASF provide as follows:\n16. In December 2007, as a result of the series of transactions, a dividend was declared to Beanteek in the form of US$2,964,000 cash, and US$606,110 and $94,464 in shares and warrants, respectively, of the Optimal Group (\u201cOptimal\u201d) arising from the sale of the assets of WowWee Inc.\n17. From 2008 through to 2011, funds in the following amounts: CAD$2,336,812, $1,316,399, $1,190,262, and $16,089 were withdrawn from the accounts registered to Beanteek.\n18. The Optimal share certificates and warrants were issued in the Appellant\u2019s name, not Beanteek\u2019s.\n[37] I note, however, that the following additional evidence was presented at trial in relation to these three items:\na) Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K, and attached Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 26, 2007, relating to the sale of WowWee\u2019s assets. [9] At page 2 of the Form 8-K, the following summary of the sale is provided:\n\u201cOn September 26, 2007, Optimal Group Inc. (the \u201cRegistrant\u201d), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Wow Wee Limited, Wow Wee Group Company, WowWee Marketing, Inc., Power Assets Pacific Ltd., Richard Yanofsky, David Goldhar, and Eric Lau Tung Ching. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of Wow Wee Limited, a privately held Hong Kong-based developer, marketer and supplier of consumer robotic, toy and electronic products, as well as substantially all of the assets of WowWee Marketing, with offices in La Jolla, California, and Wow Wee Group, with offices in Montreal, Quebec (collectively \u201cWow Wee\u201d). WowWee Marketing and Wow Wee Group provide services to Wow Wee Limited in the operation of its business. The Registrant\u2019s purchase of Wow Www assets and business is referred to herein as the \u201cTransaction\u201d.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cThe Agreement provides that Wow Wee will be acquired by three wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Registrant. The aggregate purchase price is US$65 million, US$55 million of which is payable in cash and US$10 million of which is payable to Wow Wee Limited in Optimal Group Class \u201cA\u201d Shares (Optimal Shares\u201d valued on the day preceding the closing date of the Transaction (the \u201cClosing\u201d). Optimal will also issue Wow Wee Limited warrants to purchase up to an additional 820,000 Optimal Shares (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) at an exercise price of US$5.56 per Optimal Share. Certain of the specific terms of the Warrants remain subject to determination.\u201d\n\u201cThe Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2007. Senior management of Wow Wee, including the majority shareholders of Wow Wee Limited, will continue to be employed in the business following the Closing.\u201d\nb) According to a document labeled \u201cSEC\u201310K-FYE 31 Dec 2007\u201d, Wow Wee Limited changed its name to Sell Point Holdings Limited. [10]\nc) Pursuant to a Securities Transfer Agreement dated December 17, 2007, between David Goldhar (as Purchaser) and Sell Point Holdings Limited (as Vendor), Sell Point Holdings Limited agreed to sell 154,620 Class \u201cA\u201d shares in the capital of Optimal Group Inc. and 59,040 share purchase warrants to acquire additional shares of Optimal. The agreement further states that Sell Point Holdings Limited acquired the Optimal securities under the terms of the aforementioned Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 26, 2007. Paragraph 2.1 of the Securities Transfer Agreement provides that the purchase price of the Optimal Shares is $606,110.40 and the purchase price of the Optimal Warrants is $96,646. It further provides that the purchase price shall be satisfied in full by the issuance and delivery of an interest bearing promissory note for a total amount of $700,574.40. An executed copy of the promissory note, dated December 17, 2007, provided by Mr. Goldhar to Sell Point Holdings Limited is attached to the Securities Transfer Agreement. [11]\nd) Share Certificate number 00002270 for 154,620 Class \u201cA\u201d Shares in the capital of Optimal Group Inc. was issued in the name of David Goldhar. The certificate is dated May 26, 2008. [12]\ne) A Warrant To Purchase 59,040 Class \u201cA\u201d Shares of Optimal Group Inc. was issued in the name of David Goldhar. The Warrant is dated May 1, 2008. [13]\nf) The balance sheet for Beanteek Enterprises Inc. at December 31, 2008 shows current liabilities labelled \u201cAdvances from director\u201d in the amount of HK$19,902,021.09. [14]\ng) In correspondence dated May 25, 2015, sent by Counsel for the Appellant to Scott Robinson (the CRA auditor), the appellant made the following representations to the Minister:\n\u201cDuring the period 2004 through 2006, Wow Wee Hong Kong advanced funds to David Goldhar and\/or his holding companies (including Beanteek).\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cIn December 2007, RPA also declared dividends on its class A common shares of $24,241,698 USD (which includes $5,679,822.62 USD to Beanteek.\u201d\n\u201cIn lieu of the dividend, Beanteek received the following consideration:\nCash $2,964,000 USD\nOld loans\/advances from David and\/or his holding companies $2,015,248.22 USD\nOptimal shares $606,110.40 USD\nOptimal warrants $94,464 USD\u201d [15]\n[38] There are inconsistencies between the PASF and the evidence presented at trial on the one hand and the aforementioned documents. Considering all of the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, it is my view that:\na) The US$606,110.40 and US$94,464 of Optimal shares and warrants issued in May 2008 in the name of Mr. Goldhar were purchased by him on December 17, 2007 in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of US$700,574.40. Given that Mr. Goldhar paid consideration equal to the purchase price of the shares, which equals the benefit the Minister alleges he received from Beanteek, it is my view that he did not receive any benefit from Beanteek in 2008 in respect of the Optimal Shares or Warrants that were the subject of the Minister\u2019s 2008 Reassessments.\nb) There is little evidence of the unreported cash advances of US$2,015,248 purportedly received by Beanteek, Mr. Goldhar and\/or his holding companies from WowWee leading up to the sale to Optimal in late 2007. The little evidence there is, however, indicates that the cash advances were made by WowWee during the years 2003 to 2006, and that they were set-off by Rich Point Asia (RPA) against the sale proceeds otherwise payable to Beanteek in December 2007. As a result, it is my view that Mr. Goldhar did not receive any benefit from Beanteek in 2008 (or subsequent taxation years) in respect of the unreported cash advances of US$2,015,248 that were the subject of the Minister\u2019s 2008 Reassessments.\n[39] All of the other alleged shareholder benefit amounts listed in Appendix A hereto relate to cash transfers made by Beanteek during the years 2008 to 2011 to unknown recipients, 2010 Ltd., WowWee (on behalf of Gillyboo Partnership), Marilyn Goldhar, WowWee (on behalf of Goldy Toys Partnership) and Kenscott Ltd. While the Minister alleges all of these amounts are shareholder benefits conferred on others, Mr. Goldhar argues that they are all either repayments of amounts advanced to Beanteek by him or Ms. Goldhar or were intercorporate loans relating to the business ventures he pursued after leaving Optimal. Based on all of the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, it is my view that the evidence supports Mr. Goldhar\u2019s position more than the Minister\u2019s position. In this respect, I note the following:\na) As noted above, the balance sheet of Beanteek Enterprises Inc. at December 31, 2008 showed current liabilities labelled \u201cAdvances from director\u201d in the amount of HK$19,902,021.09. [16]\nb) On January 9, 2009, 2010 Ltd. repaid an amount equal to CAD$1,218,520 to Beanteek. This was one day after a US$1,100,000 transfer from Beanteek to 2010 Ltd. I note that the Minister included the transfer from Beanteek to 2010 Ltd. in the benefits assessed against Mr. Goldhar in 2009, but did not reduce the benefits assessed to Mr. Goldhar in 2009 by the amount of the repayment. Instead, the Minister reduced the amount of benefits assessed in 2011 and 2012. [17]\nc) On March 24, 2011, WowWee repaid $536,084.04 to Beanteek. This amount was not reflected in the amounts assessed against Mr.Goldhar in his 2008 to 2011 taxation years. Instead, the Minister reduced the amount of benefits assessed in 2012 and 2013.\nd) Miller Thompson LLP registered a Security Agreement in Ontario in respect of a loan by Beanteek Enterprises Limited to Gold Toys Partnership. [18]\n[40] Based on all of the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, it is my view that the Minister has not proven that Mr. Goldhar made the alleged misrepresentations in his 2008 to 2011 taxation years. Even if the Court was to accept that the Minister has met her onus with respect to some of the alleged shareholder benefit amounts, it is my view that the Minister assessed a substantial portion of the amounts discussed above in the wrong taxation years. As a result, even if the Court otherwise accepted that the Minister had met her onus with respect to some of the amounts, those amounts should be reduced by the following amounts:\na) In 2008, by CAD$601,685.40, CAD93,774.41, and CAD$2,000,536.69, for a total of CAD$2,695,996.50 (being the amounts for the Optimal Shares and Warrants and the prior year Unreported Cash advances);\nb) In 2009, by CAD$1,218,520, being the amount of the 2010 Ltd. loan which was repaid on January 9, 2009, being the day after it was made; and\nc) In 2010, by CAD$536,084.04, being the amount of the WowWee loan which was repaid on March 24, 2011. This loan appears to have been advanced by Beanteek to WowWee on August 5, 2010. [19]\n[41] These adjustments would reduce the amount of benefits otherwise assessed for Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years from CAD$5,555,022.39 to CAD$1,104,421.85, for a total reduction of CAD$4,450,600.54.\n[42] As previously noted, the Minister also has the onus of proving that misrepresentations were attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the Minister has not established that the misrepresentations allegedly made by Mr. Goldhar in his 2008 to 2011 taxation years were attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\n[43] In Venne v. R., [1984] C.T.C. 223, at paragraph 16, Strayer J. noted the following:\n16 I am satisfied that it is sufficient for the Minister, in order to invoke the power under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act to show that, with respect to any one or more aspects of his income tax return for a given year, a taxpayer has been negligent. Such negligence is established if it is shown that the taxpayer has not exercised reasonable care. This is surely what the words \u201cmisrepresentation that is attributable to neglect\u201d must mean, particularly when combined with other grounds such as \u201ccarelessness\u201d or \u201cwilful default\u201d which refer to a higher degree of negligence or to intentional misconduct. Unless these words are superfluous in the section, which I am not able to assume, the term \u201cneglect\u201d involves a lesser standard of deficiency akin to that used in other fields of law such as the law of tort. \u2026\n[Emphasis added]\n[44] In Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd. v. R., [1991] C.T.C. 297 (FCA), at paragraph 7, it was also noted that \u201cIt has also been established that the care exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct.\u201d\n[45] In this case, Mr. Goldhar relied upon professional accountants to file his corporate and personal tax returns during the taxation years under appeal. He also relied upon lawyers and his professional accountants to structure his legal affairs. Because of his heavy travel and work schedule, he also relied upon his spouse, Marilyn Goldhar, to help with his financial affairs, including providing information to his accountants as and when needed. When they became aware of an issue with Mr. Goldhar\u2019s T1134 reporting, they contacted the accountant to deal with it promptly, and when they were not satisfied that it was being dealt with satisfactorily, they switched accountants. Overall, I am of the view, based on all of the evidence, that Mr. Goldhar, with the assistance of his spouse and his professional accountants, acted in a wise and prudent manner and exercised reasonable care in dealing with the filing of his tax returns in each of his 2008 to 2011 taxation years. In this respect, I note the following:\na) Mr. Goldhar did not have a background in tax, business administration or accounting. He was a sales person and travelled extensively for his work.\nb) Mr. Goldhar never filed his own tax returns. The professional accountants that he engaged always filed his tax returns, including for the taxation years under appeal herein.\nc) Mr. Goldhar and Ms. Goldhar communicated frequently with his accountants.\nd) Mr. Goldhar\u2019s financial affairs became more complicated just before and during the taxation years under appeal.\ne) Although the Respondent argued that Mr. Goldhar\u2019s accountants were not aware of his offshore corporations, this is not supported by the evidence. Mr. Goldhar\u2019s accountants filed T1134 forms for Beanteek for each of 2008, 2010 and 2011. Mr. Pelchovitz was unable to explain why his firm did not file the T1134 for Beanteek in 2009. Mr. Goldhar also obtained tax advice from his accountants with respect to Beanteek. [20] Although Mr. Pelchovitz testified that he was not aware of 2010 Ltd, this is also not supported by the evidence, as his firm properly filed a T1134 for both Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year.\nf) In terms of his tax filing process, Ms. Goldhar gathered all of the information required by the accountants. Mr. Goldhar testified that he discussed his tax filings with his accountants.\ng) Mr. Goldhar and Ms. Goldhar were not direct partners in the Gillyboo Group Partnership. Rather, each of the underlying principals in Gillyboo used a corporate structure involving two corporations. Mr. Pelchovitz and his firm prepared the tax returns for the Goldhar\u2019s Canadian corporations.\nh) Mr. Goldhar was not a direct partner in the Goldy Toys Partnership. The partners were corporations.\ni) Beanteek advanced funds to WowWee and Kenscott Ltd. for the purpose of financing inventory purchases on behalf of both the Gillyboo Group Partnership and the Goldy Toys Partnership. Mr. Goldhar described the funds advanced as being intercorporate loans. Those partnerships were ultimately not successful.\nj) The Partnership Withdrawal Agreement dated December 31, 2010 in relation to the withdrawal of the Goldhars from the Gillyboo Group Partnership, collectively defines the \u201cGoldhars\u201d as including Mr. Goldhar, Ms. Goldhar, and their four numbered Ontario corporations. At paragraphs 1.2 and 1.5 of that agreement, the parties acknowledge that the \u201cGoldhars\u201d had loaned $200,000 and USD$1,000,000 to the Gillyboo Group Partnership. [21] While the Respondent argued references to \u201cGoldhars\u201d in the agreement was indicative of personal loans by Mr. Goldhar to the Gillyboo Group Partnership, it is my view that the agreement supports Mr. Goldhar\u2019s testimony that the loans were intercorporate loans from Beanteek. In this respect, I note that the numbered corporations, and not Mr. Goldhar or Ms. Goldhar, were partners of Gillyboo Group.\nk) Mr. Goldhar testified that he (with the assistance of Ms. Goldhar) gave his accountants, including Mr. Pelchovitz, all of the financial and other information they had on Beanteek.\nl) Mr. Goldhar used Jerry Pinkas at Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP in respect of the filing of his 2008 tax return. That firm was also the accountant for Mr. Yanofsky. When the CRA raised an issue in 2009 with the T1134 filing in respect of Beanteek, Mr. Goldhar switched to Dacks and Levine, Chartered Accountants. He then switched to Mr. Pelchovitz at Truster Zweig LLP in 2009 because Mr. Pelchovitz was the accountant for Mr. Gelbard, with whom Mr. Goldhar did business through the Gillyboo Group Partnership. Mr. Pelchovitz and his firm were responsible for filing all of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s personal and Canadian corporate tax returns in 2009, 2010 and 2011. They also provided tax advice and instructions relating to the structuring of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s corporate matters from 2009 to 2011 (and following years).\nm) Mr. Goldhar testified that he consistently provided the same information to his accountants in respect of each of his 2008 to 2011 taxations years, and it was unclear to him why the accountants made mistakes in some of those years.\nn) On cross examination, Mr. Goldhar testified that he would go through his returns with his accountants every year the same way for 30 years. While he did not understand all of the details, he testified that his returns would be explained to him, including in particular what he owed each year to the government. Mr. Goldhar further testified that he was not aware of any deficiencies with his tax returns until advised by the CRA.\no) The invoice from Jerry Pinkas at Schwartz Levitsky Feldman LLP (SLF) dated March 31, 2009, [22] makes it clear that SLF provided Mr. Goldhar with tax advice in respect of Beanteek and also that it requested that Mr. Kennedy in Hong Kong provide it with financial statements for Beanteek for its 2006 to 2008 taxation years.\np) Ms. Goldhar testified that she personally lent money to the various businesses carried on by Mr. Goldhar and\/or her through their respective corporations and partnerships.\nq) Mr. Pelchovitz testified that the corporate structure he and his firm put in place for the Goldhars was designed by Perry Truster, a former chair of the Canadian Tax Foundation. He further testified that for tax filing season each year he would get in touch with Ms. Goldhar who was very organized and she would get and supply him with the information he required. He further testified that she was very prompt in replying to his requests. He described her as a \u201cstar\u201d in terms of her responsiveness. He also testified that he relied on one of the tax managers in his office to deal with the foreign reporting for Mr. Goldhar and his corporations. He also testified that he was not sure why his firm made reporting errors in respect of the T1134s for Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2009 and 2010 taxation years but were able to properly file them in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year.\nr) Mr. Pelchovitz further testified that he was not aware of any other tax compliance issues with respect to Mr. Goldhar\u2019s personal or corporate tax filings.\ns) T1134s were filed without deficiencies by Mr. Goldhar\u2019s accountant for each of Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year, which was approximately 2-3 years before CRA commenced its audit. [23]\n[46] Overall, it is my view that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Goldhar exercised reasonable care in his tax reporting in his 2008 to 2011 taxation years. It is also my view that the care he exercised was that of a wise and prudent person. Mr. Goldhar carried on an international business, and engaged professional lawyers and accountants to assist in organizing his financial affairs and in filing his personal and corporate tax returns. With the assistance of his spouse, Ms. Goldhar, he sought to provide his professional accountants with all necessary information on a timely basis. Mr. Pelchovitz testified that they did so. When the CRA asked for more information regarding the 2008 T1134, they responded promptly by instructing their accountant to deal with it, and when he did not act satisfactorily, they promptly switched accounting firms. Considering the complexity of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s businesses and his lack of tax expertise, it is my view that he took all reasonable steps that a wise and prudent person would to ensure that his tax returns were filed properly during the taxation years under appeal. While the Respondent argues that Mr. Goldhar should have undertaken additional steps, such as a more thorough review of the returns or by asking more questions of his accountants, it is my view that such additional steps were not practical in the circumstances of this case, because Mr. Goldhar lacked the expertise to undertake a more through review. He would have had to be a tax expert to do so. That is not the standard. That is why he engaged a professional accounting firm, which had professional tax experts within its ranks, to provide him with tax advice and file his tax returns.\n[47] Based on all of the foregoing, it is my view that the Minister has not met her onus to prove both the misrepresentations that she alleges were made in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years and that the alleged misrepresentations were attributable to neglect, careless or wilful default.\n(ii) Subsection 163(2) Penalties\n[48] The next issue in these appeals is whether the Minister properly assessed penalties in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years pursuant to subsection l63(2) of the Act. For the reasons that follow, it is my view that subsection 163(2) should not apply in all of the circumstances of these appeals.\n[49] Subsection 163(2) of the Act provides that:\n(2) False statements or omissions \u2014 Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty of the greater of $100 and 50% of the total of \u2026\n[50] In addition, subsection 163(3) of the Act provides that:\n(3) Burden of proof in respect of penalties \u2014 Where, in an appeal under this Act, a penalty assessed by the Minister under this section or section 163.2 is in issue, the burden of establishing the facts justifying the assessment of the penalty is on the Minister.\n[51] As a result, the Respondent in this case must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that (i) each of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 tax returns contained a false statement or omission and (ii) Mr. Goldhar made, participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making thereof knowingly or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence. [24]\n[52] The seminal case on this issue is Venne v. The Queen, [1984] C.T.C. 223, 84 D.T.C. 6247, at para. 37: \u201c\u2018Gross Negligence\u2019\u201d must be taken to involve greater neglect than simply a failure to use reasonable care. It must involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, an indifference as to whether the law is complied with or not.\u201d The \u201cconduct must include a high degree of negligence equal to intentional acting or indifference as to compliance\u201d: Melman v. R., 2017 FCA 83, at para. 4. [25]\n[53] In Khanna v. R., Monaghan J.A. also noted the following at paragraph 24:\n\u2026 As this Court has stated, \u201csimply finding that an unreported amount is taxable does not inevitably lead to a conclusion that a gross negligence penalty is justified\u201d: Deyab v Canada 2020 FCA 222, [2021] 4 C.T.C 83, at para. 65, leave to appeal to S.C.C refused, 39587 (June 10, 2021), [Deyab]. When a taxpayer has unreported income, \u201cthe circumstances related to the failure to report the income must be examined to determine if such failure was attributable to ... gross negligence (to justify the assessment of the gross negligence penalty)\u201d: Deyab at para. 66. [26]\n[54] In this case, as discussed above, it is my view that the Respondent has not established that the Appellant failed to report a significant portion of the alleged unreported income in the taxation years under appeal herein. As a result, penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act should not apply to those amounts irrespective of this Court\u2019s findings with respect to the degree of the Appellant\u2019s negligence (if any) in filing his 2008 to 2011 tax returns.\n[55] I also note that it is the Appellant\u2019s position that many, if not all, of the other alleged unreported income amounts were intercorporate loans from Beanteek to other entities within Mr. Goldhar\u2019s corporate structure, or were repayments of amounts he or Ms. Goldhar advanced to Beanteek. In this respect, I note that the Beanteek financial statements as at December 31, 2008 showed current liabilities in relation to \u201cAdvances from director\u201d in the amount of HK$19,902,021.09. [27]\n[56] Considering the Appellant\u2019s credible testimony, the fact that many of the Beanteek transfers went to other entities Mr. Goldhar was dealing with, such as 2010 Ltd., WowWee and Kenscott Ltd., and the fact that there were material repayments of these transfers during the taxation years under appeal, it is my view that the Appellant did not file his 2008 to 2011 tax returns with knowledge of the alleged errors or omissions or with a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting or an indifference as to whether the law was complied with or not. Rather, it is my view that the Appellant, with the assistance of his spouse, made every attempt to ensure that his tax returns were filed properly and accurately for each of the taxation years under appeal. In this respect, I note that he engaged professional CPA firms to file his tax returns for each of those years and he, with the assistance of his spouse, attempted to provide them with all of the information required to properly file those tax returns. I also note that T1134 filing was undertaken for Beanteek in 2008, 2010 and 2011 and that T1134 filing was undertaken for 2010 Ltd. in 2011. As a result, there is clear evidence that his accountants were aware of his offshore corporations and the need to report on their activities. Given the complexity of his business affairs, and the efforts he and Ms. Goldhar took to provide his accountants and lawyers with all relevant information, it was in view reasonable for Mr. Goldhar to rely on his professional accounting firms to ensure that his 2008 to 2011 tax reruns were properly and accurately filed. In my view, any errors or omissions contained in those returns were not attributable to his knowledge or any degree of neglect, and in particular not a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting.\n[57] Based on all of the foregoing, it is my view that subsection 163(2) penalties should not apply to Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years in all of the circumstances of these appeals.\n(iii) T1134 Penalties \u2013 Foreign Reporting\n[58] The last issue in these appeals is whether the Minister correctly applied penalties in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years pursuant to paragraphs 162(7)(a), 162(10)(a), 162(10.1)(f) and 163(2.4)(d) of the Act. For the reason that follow, it is my view that the Appellant has established that he was diligent in attempting to address his foreign tax reporting obligations under the Act and therefore should not be subject to these penalties. I also note that the Minister has admitted facts, which invalidate the application of the penalties with respect to Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year.\n[59] Following are the relevant sections of the Act:\n162(7) Failure to comply \u2014 Every person (other than a registered charity) or partnership who fails\n(a) to file an information return as and when required by this Act or the regulations, or\n(b) to comply with a duty or obligation imposed by this Act or the regulations\nis liable in respect of each such failure, except where another provision of this Act (other than subsection (10) or (10.1) or 163(2.22)) sets out a penalty for the failure, to a penalty equal to the greater of $100 and the product obtained when $25 is multiplied by the number of days, not exceeding 100, during which the failure continues.\n\u2026\n162 (10) Failure to furnish foreign-based information \u2014 Every person or partnership who,\n(a) knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, fails to file an information return as and when required by any of sections 233.1 to 233.4 and 233.8, or\n(b) where paragraph (a) does not apply, knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, fails to comply with a demand under section 233 to file a return\nis liable to a penalty equal to the amount determined by the formula \u2026\n162 (10.1) Additional penalty \u2014 Where\n(a) a person or partnership is liable to a penalty under subsection (10) for the failure to file a return (other than an information return required to be filed under section 233.1),\n(b) if paragraph (10)(a) applies, the number of months, beginning with the month in which the return was required to be filed, during any part of which the return has not been filed exceeds 24, and\n(c) if paragraph (10)(b) applies, the number of months, beginning with the month in which the demand referred to in that paragraph was served, during any part of which the return has not been filed exceeds 24,\nthe person or partnership is liable, in addition to the penalty determined under subsection (10), to a penalty equal to the amount determined by the formula\nA \u2013 B\nwhere\nA is\n(d) if the return is required to be filed under section 233.2 in respect of a trust, 5% of the total of all amounts each of which is the fair market value, at the time it was made, of a contribution of the person or partnership made to the trust before the end of the last taxation year of the trust in respect of which the return is required,\n(e) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.3 for a taxation year or fiscal period, 5% of the greatest of all amounts each of which is the total of the cost amounts to the person or partnership at any time in the year or period of a specified foreign property (as defined by subsection 233.3(1)) of the person or partnership, and\n(f) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.4 for a taxation year or fiscal period in respect of a foreign affiliate of the person or partnership, 5% of the greatest of all amounts each of which is the total of the cost amounts to the person or partnership at any time in the year or period of a property of the person or partnership that is a share of the capital stock or indebtedness of the affiliate, and\nB is the total of the penalties to which the person or partnership is liable under subsections (7) and (10) in respect of the return.\n163 (2.4) False statement or omission [re foreign asset reporting] \u2014 Every person or partnership who, knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, makes or participates in, assents to or acquiesces in, the making of a false statement or omission in a return is liable to a penalty of\n(a) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.1, $24,000;\n(b) if the return is required to be filed under section 233.2 in respect of a trust, the greater of\n(i) $24,000, and\n(ii) 5% of the total of all amounts each of which is the fair market value, at the time it was made, of a contribution of the person or partnership made to the trust before the end of the last taxation year of the trust in respect of which the return is required;\n(c) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.3 for a taxation year or fiscal period, the greater of\n(i) $24,000, and\n(ii) 5% of the greatest of all amounts each of which is the total of the cost amounts to the person or partnership at any time in the year or period of a specified foreign property (as defined by subsection 233.3(1)(a)) of the person or partnership in respect of which the false statement or omission is made;\n(d) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.4 for a taxation year or fiscal period, the greater of\n(i) $24,000, and\n(ii) 5% of the greatest of all amounts each of which is the total of the cost amounts to the person or partnership at any time in the year or period of a property of the person or partnership that is a share of the capital stock or indebtedness of the foreign affiliate in respect of which the return is being filed; and\n(e) where the return is required to be filed under section 233.6 for a taxation year or fiscal period, the greater of\n(i) $2,500, and\n(ii) 5% of the total of\n(A) all amounts each of which is the fair market value of a property that is distributed to the person or partnership in the year or period by the trust and in respect of which the false statement or omission is made, and\n(B) all amounts each of which is the greatest unpaid principal amount of a debt that is owing to the trust by the person or partnership in the year or period and in respect of which the false statement or omission is made.\n[60] With respect to the penalties imposed under paragraphs 162(10(a) and 163(2.4)(d) of the Act, it is my view that the Appellant did not act knowingly or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence with respect to any failure to file a T1134 information return or in the making of a false statement or omission in respect of the filing of a T1134 information return. In my view the reasons set out above in respect of subsection 163(2) and subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act apply equally in the circumstances of these provisions.\n[61] As set out in paragraph 28 of the PASF, T1134 forms were properly filed for both Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year. The T1134 Reassessment dated July 7, 2017, in respect of 2011 indicates that penalties were applied in respect of Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. [28] No other foreign affiliates are referenced, although Mr. Robinson testified that the 2011 T1134 penalties were related to Beanteek, 2010 Ltd and possibly one or more other corporations. After being advised on cross-examination that the Minister had agreed that the 2011 T1134 form for Beanteek and 2010 Ltd was properly completed, Mr. Robinson recanted his testimony and suggested the penalty applied in respect of some other foreign corporations. However, I note that is contrary to the 2011 T1134 Notice of Reassessment itself, which only references Beanteek and 2010 Ltd in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year. While I found that Mr. Robinson was generally a credible witness, his testimony on this issue undermined the veracity of his testimony generally. Based on the 2011 T1134 Notice of Reassessment and the Respondent\u2019s admissions set out in paragraph 28 of the PASF, it is my view that there is no factual basis for any of the T1134 penalties imposed in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2011 taxation year.\n[62] I note that a T1134 form was filed for Beanteek in respect of the 2008, 2010 and 2011 taxation years. In addition, a T1134 form was filed for 2010 Ltd. in respect of the 2011 taxation year. I also note that Mr. Goldhar engaged a new accountant as soon as he became aware that there was a deficiency in respect of his 2008 T1134. It is also clear that he, with the assistance of Ms. Goldhar, instructed his accountants to address the proper filing of his T1134 form in respect of Beanteek and 2010 Ltd. It is also clear that he, with the assistance of Ms. Goldhar, made every effort to provide his accountants with all necessary information so that they could properly and accurately complete his 2008 to 2011 tax returns. Based on all of the evidence, it is my view that any failure to comply was not due to a lack of effort or due diligence on the part of Mr. Goldhar or Ms. Goldhar.\n[63] Penalties under paragraphs 162(7)(a) and 162(10.1)(f) are subject to a due diligence defence. In Chiang v. R., 2017 TCC 165, at paragraphs 25-26, Justice Sommerfeldt of this Court provided the following summary of the due diligence defence:\n25 I have considered whether Mr. Chiang may rely on the due diligence defence, which the Supreme Court of Canada explained as follows:\nThe due diligence defence is available if the defendant reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would have rendered his or her act or omission innocent. A defendant can also avoid liability by showing that he or she took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.... The defence of due diligence is based on an objective standard: it requires consideration of what a reasonable person would have done in similar circumstances.\n26 Although La Souveraine dealt with a regulatory offence, the Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that the defence is also available in respect of administrative penalties:\nThis Court has held that there is no bar to the defence argument of due diligence, which a person may rely on against charges involving strict liability, being put forward in opposition to administrative penalties.... It may be worth reviewing the principles governing the defence of due diligence before applying them to the facts of the case at bar.\nThe due diligence defence allows a person to avoid the imposition of a penalty if he or she presents evidence that he or she was not negligent. It involves considering whether the person believed on reasonable grounds in a non-existent state of facts which, if it had existed, would have made his or her act or omission innocent, or whether he or she took all reasonable precautions to avoid the event leading to the imposition of the penalty.... In other words, due diligence excuses either a reasonable error of fact, or the taking of reasonable precautions to comply with the Act.\n[Emphasis added]\n[64] In this case, as discussed above, it is my view that Mr. Goldhar has established that he took all reasonable steps and was not negligent in filing his tax returns, including form T1134 in each of his 2008-2011 taxation years. With the assistance of Ms. Goldhar, he provided all requested information to his accountants each year and made reasonable efforts to ensure that his tax returns were filed accurately. In my view, any deficiency in his T1134 filings was not due to a lack of reasonable efforts he undertook, with the assistance of Ms. Goldhar and his professional accountants. For example, he did file a T1134 form in 2008 in respect of Beanteek, albeit with a deficiency he was not aware of until so advised by the CRA on June 8, 2009. [29] With the assistance of Ms. Goldhar, he undertook to resolve this deficiency promptly with respect to 2008 and going forward, going so far as to switch professional accounting firms. While Mr. Pelchovitz, in his testimony did not know why T1134 forms were not filed for Beanteek in 2009 and 2010 Ltd. in 2009 and 2010, I note that his firm did properly file T1134 forms for both corporations in 2011 and it is clear that his firm was aware of the existence of both corporations and the necessity to file the T1134 forms. Due to complexity of his financial affairs, and his lack of tax background, it is my view that Mr. Goldhar reasonably relied on his accountants to properly file his tax returns in each of his 2008 to 2011 taxation years.\n[65] Based on all of the foregoing, it is my view that none of the referenced T1134 penalties assessed by the Minister in respect of Mr. Goldhar\u2019s 2008 to 2011 taxation years were properly imposed, and all should accordingly be vacated.\nCONCLUSION\n[66] Based on all of the foregoing, Mr. Goldhar\u2019s appeals from the Reassessments dated July 7, 2017, and November 20, 2017, for the Appellant\u2019s 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years are allowed and the reassessments are vacated.\nCOSTS\n[67] Costs are awarded to the Appellant. The parties shall have 30 days from the date hereof to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the Appellant shall have a further 30 days to file written submissions on costs and the Respondent shall have yet a further 30 days to file a written response. Any such submissions shall not exceed 10 pages in length. If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received, costs shall be awarded to the Appellant as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 10th day of March 2023.\n\u201cHenry A.

BACKGROUND TO THE MOTION\n[1] The Appellant, Jose Antonio Virito Reyes, is a certified public accountant and lawyer, both designations in the Dominican Republic. The Appellant is self-represented. The Appellant immigrated to Canada in 2012 and is a resident of Canada for purposes of the ITA. The Appellant has a consulting business which he carries on in Canada and the Dominican Republic, providing services to clients including those in the Dominican Republic.\n[2] The appeals filed in this Court are for the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years. At issue is the deductibility of various expenses which the Appellant claims were incurred for the purposes of gaining or producing income from his consulting business. These include claims for travel, telecommunication, home office, and other expenses.\n[3] The Respondent does not dispute that the appeal for the 2017 taxation year has been properly constituted; the motion is in respect of the other years.\nII. THE MOTION\n[4] The Respondent[4] brings a motion:\nSeeking an order quashing the appeals of the Appellant for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years[5], under paragraph 55(3)(b) of the Rules on the grounds that a condition precedent to instituting a valid appeal under subsection 169(1) for each of those taxation years has not been met;\nSeeking an order striking the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal as a whole, pursuant to subsection 53(1) of the Rules, with leave granted to file an Amended Notice of Appeal within 30 days of the date of the order. In the alternative, the Respondent asks the Court to strike out sections of the Notice of Appeal identified in Appendix A to its submissions (dated September 9, 2022) and order the Appellant to follow Form 21(1)(a) of the Rules in filing an Amended Notice of Appeal, and to include the material facts relied on by the Appellant to contest the correctness of the assessments remaining in issue;\nSeeking an extension of time for the Respondent to file its Reply to the Amended Notice of Appeal, to 60 days after the Amended Notice of Appeal is filed and served, or if the motion ordering the Appellant to amend the Notice of Appeal is not granted, to 30 days from the date of an order of the Court; and\nSeeking costs of the motion.\n[5] The hearing of this motion commenced on August 18, 2022 and resumed on November 10, 2022, after further written submissions were filed with the Court. Further submissions were received on May 12, 2023.\n[6] As a preliminary matter, the Respondent requested that the Court accept the supplementary affidavit of Mr. Sadruddin Suleman filed on September 9, 2022. I do not see a need for an order as the affidavit was served and filed within the time prescribed by section 67 of the Rules.\nIII. PRELIMINARY MATTER\n[7] I find Mr. Reyes\u2019 position on the motion to be unresponsive to the issues raised by the Respondent. On both hearing dates, I encouraged the Appellant to address the Respondent\u2019s arguments on the alleged failure to timely file notices of objection, the restrictions on appealing certain assessments and the Respondent\u2019s arguments in respect of the motion to strike.\n[8] To put the Appellant\u2019s arguments on the motion into context, I note that the Appellant\u2019s position on the underlying appeals is that Canada has no right to tax the income he earns from carrying on consulting activities with clients based in the Dominican Republic. He foreshadows that he will be relying on the provisions of the Convention between Canada and the Dominican Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital (the \u201cCanada-DR Tax Treaty\u201d)[6] and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Vienna Austria, 1969 (the \u201cVienna Convention\u201d)[7] in support of his argument that notwithstanding that he is a Canadian resident, for purposes of the ITA, he is not liable to tax on his \u201cworldwide income\u201d.\n[9] The Appellant\u2019s position on the motion is similar. The Appellant submits, in reliance on the Canada-DR Tax Treaty and the Vienna Convention, that because this is an \u201cinternational\u201d tax case, he is exempt from limitation periods and procedural compliance under the provisions of the ITA. He also submits that the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) has violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[8]\n[10] I encouraged the Appellant not to rely on these conceptual arguments, and to directly address the various detailed arguments put forward by the Respondent. The Appellant chose not to do so in any of his written submissions[9] or in his oral argument. The Appellant acknowledges that he has not addressed the issues raised by the Respondent since he does not accept the basic premise of the Respondent\u2019s position, or as he says, he \u201cdisagrees with the system\u201d.\nIV. ISSUES\nMotion to Quash\n[11] The Respondent asks this Court to quash the appeals for the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.[10] The Respondent\u2019s submissions differ based on the taxation year. Accordingly, this section is in two parts: the first part addresses the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years and the second part addresses the 2014 (and 2018) taxation years.\nV. THE 2013, 2015 AND 2016 TAXATION YEARS\nThe Parties\u2019 Positions\n[12] The Respondent submits that subsection 165(1.2) precludes the Appellant from objecting or appealing the reassessments for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years, because those assessments were issued under subsection 152(4.2).[11]\n[13] The Appellant did not address the Respondent\u2019s arguments that relate to the potential impact on his appeal rights of an assessment issued under subsection 152(4.2). The Appellant takes the position that in respect of income earned by him in the Dominican Republic, he is not governed by the procedural rules of the ITA for the objection and appeals process, including subsection 152(4.2). I disagree for reasons provided further below. First, I address the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\nVI. LAW\n[14] Section 152 sets time limits on the Minister of National Revenue\u2019s (the \u201cMinister\u2019s\u201d) authority to assess and reassess. Pursuant to subsection 152(4), the Minister generally has three years to assess or reassess an individual taxpayer, starting from the date of the original notice of assessment or original notification that no tax is payable (the \u201cnormal reassessment period\u201d).[12]\n[15] Subsection 152(4.2) allows the Minister to reassess an individual taxpayer after the expiration of the normal reassessment period to determine a refund or reduce an amount payable, upon application by the individual. The Minister\u2019s ability to make a \u201cdownward adjustment\u201d under subsection 152(4.2) provides relief to individuals who, for example, become aware after the normal reassessment period that an otherwise valid claim for a deduction or credit was inadvertently not made.\n[16] Subsection 152(4.2) reads as follows:\n(4.2) Notwithstanding subsections (4), (4.1) and (5), for the purpose of determining \u2014 at any time after the end of the normal reassessment period, of a taxpayer who is an individual (other than a trust) or a graduated rate estate, in respect of a taxation year \u2014 the amount of any refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year, or a reduction of an amount payable under this Part by the taxpayer for the year, the Minister may, if the taxpayer makes an application for that determination on or before the day that is 10 calendar years after the end of that taxation year,\n(a) reassess tax, interest or penalties payable under this Part by the taxpayer in respect of that year; and\n\u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[17] Subsection 152(4.2) is discretionary. The Minister \u201cmay\u201d, but is not obliged to, issue an assessment under subsection 152(4.2) if the conditions are met.[13]\n[18] An assessment under subsection 152(4.2) is similar to other \u201cfairness\u201d provisions of the ITA. If a taxpayer believes that the Minister did not properly exercise its discretion in considering the request for relief under subsection 152(4.2), a second review may be requested and the taxpayer has an opportunity to make additional representations.[14]\n[19] If the taxpayer disagrees with the discretion exercised in the second review, the taxpayer can apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the CRA decision within 30 days of the date of receipt of the second review decision.[15] The Federal Court may not substitute its decision for the CRA\u2019s decision, but may grant judicial review and send the matter back for reconsideration.[16]\n[20] As with assessments issued under other \u201cfairness\u201d provisions of the ITA, pursuant to subsection 165(1.2), a taxpayer cannot object to an assessment made under subsection 152(4.2). Subsection 165(1.2) reads as follows:\n(1.2) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (1.1), no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection 118.1(11), 152(4.2), 169(3) or 220(3.1) nor, for greater certainty, in respect of an issue for which the right of objection has been waived in writing by the taxpayer.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[21] If a taxpayer cannot object to a reassessment, then the taxpayer cannot appeal to the Tax Court due to subsection 169(1), which reads as follows:\nWhere a taxpayer has served a notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied after either\ni)the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed, or\nii)90 days have elapsed after service of the notice of objection and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer that the Minister has vacated or confirmed the assessment or reassessed,\nbut no appeal under this section may be instituted after the expiration of 90 days from the day the notice has been sent to the taxpayer under section 165 that the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[22] This Court has consistently held that where a reassessment is issued under subsection 152(4.2), there is no right of appeal to the Tax Court because no valid objection can be filed.[17] In Groulx, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of this Court quashing the taxpayer\u2019s appeal for taxation years for which assessments were issued under subsection 152(4.2) on the basis that \u201cbecause no valid objections could be made against those reassessments, no appeals against them, under subsection 169(1) were permissible\u201d.[18]\nVII. ANALYSIS\n(i) Reassessments Issued Under Subsection 152(4.2)\n[23] The reassessments for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years were issued on October 22, 2020. It therefore becomes essential to determine whether they were issued under subsection 152(4) or 152(4.2).\n[24] There are four conditions for a reassessment to be issued under subsection 152(4.2):\nThe reassessment is issued at any time after the end of the normal reassessment period;\nThe reassessment is for the purpose of determining the amount of any refund to which the taxpayer is entitled at that time for the year, or a reduction of an amount payable under Part I for the year;\nThe taxpayer makes an application for that determination; and\nThe application is made on or before the day that is 10 calendar years after the end of that taxation year.\n[25] The first criterion is met. The October 22, 2020 reassessments were issued after the end of the normal reassessment period for all three years. The relevant dates are:\nTaxation Year\nDate of issuance for the initial notice of assessment\nEnd of the normal reassessment period\n2013\nOctober 30, 2014\nOctober 30, 2017\n2015\nApril 25, 2016\nApril 25, 2019\n2016\nApril 3, 2017\nApril 3, 2020\n[26] The second criterion is met. Notices of reassessment were issued for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years on October 22, 2020.[19] The reassessments allowed the taxpayer\u2019s deduction for certain expenses incurred for the purposes of generating income from his consulting business, and reduced taxes payable under Part I for all three taxation years:\nTaxation Year\nTaxes payable pursuant to the notices of assessment (A)\nTaxes payable pursuant to the notice of reassessment (B)\nReduction in taxes payable (A less B)\n2013\n$353.01[20]\n$224.45[21]\n$127.56\n2015\n$3,830.14[22]\n$3,421.62[23]\n$408.52\n2016\n$12,572.32[24]\n$11,454.54[25]\n$1,117.78\n[27] The third criterion is met. The Appellant submitted T1 adjustment requests[26] with the latest being November 9, 2018 (received by the CRA on November 22, 2018) in respect of expenses incurred for the purposes of generating income in the Dominican Republic in the relevant taxation years.[27]\n[28] The fourth criterion is met. The Appellant applied before the day that is 10 calendar years after the end of the taxation years under appeal. The Appellant\u2019s T1 adjustment requests (the latest of which was made in 2018) were well within 10 calendar years after the end of the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\n[29] Here, the Appellant was advised, in response to the T1 adjustments submitted:\nThat a review of the determination made in response to the request was available; and\nThat a second review under the \u201cTaxpayer Relief Provisions\u201d was available, but because the reassessments issued in response to the requests were issued under subsection 152(4.2), there was no right of objection.[28]\nAs further confirmed in the discussion that follows, I agree that the assessments were issued under subsection 152(4.2).\n[30] While the reassessments were issued after the normal reassessment period for each of the years (satisfying the first criterion), I have also considered whether the timing of the T1 adjustment requests which led to the reassessments \u2013 submitted to the CRA before the normal reassessment period expired for the 2015 and 2016 taxation years \u2013 has any bearing on whether the reassessments were issued under subsection 152(4.2) for those years. I have determined that it does not.\n[31] The language in subsection 152(4.2) is clear \u2013 the relevant event is the time of the Minister\u2019s determination \u2013 after the normal reassessment period; the section does not take into account when the taxpayer\u2019s application was made. I note that when a T1 adjustment request is made close in time to the end of a normal reassessment period, or the Minister takes a long time to reassess, it potentially puts within the Minister\u2019s control whether a reassessment is issued under subsection 152(4) or 152(4.2).\n[32] A timing issue in respect of whether an assessment was issued under subsection 152(4.2) arose in DouangChanh[29]. In that case, this Court ruled that the Minister did not issue a reassessment pursuant to subsection 152(4.2) when the applicant requested a further reassessment that was issued after the normal reassessment period. The applicant filed a notice of objection to his November 9, 2009 reassessment and, shortly after, submitted a T1 adjustment request, all within the normal reassessment period. The Minister issued a reassessment in response to the T1 adjustment request on October 18, 2011, after the end of the normal reassessment period. The Court concluded that it was \u201cvery unlikely that the applicant intended to request a reassessment to be made after the normal reassessment period thereby removing his appeal rights with respect to the [objection to the] charitable donation\u201d[30], and treated the October 18, 2011 reassessment as statute barred and the November 9, 2009 reassessment as still valid. Thus, the Court was able to conclude that the applicant validly objected to the November 9, 2009 reassessment preserving his appeal rights before the Court.[31]\n[33] The reasoning in DouangChanh does not affect the result here. Unlike the applicant in DouangChanh, the Appellant did not stand to lose any rights to object by submitting T1 adjustment requests as no objections had been filed at the time those adjustment requests were submitted. Notices of objection for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years were filed on November 22, 2020.[32]\n(ii) Submissions on the Applicability of Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii)\n[34] After the hearing, I requested written submissions from the parties on the following:[33]\nWhether any of the T1 adjustment requests pertaining to the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 or 2016 taxation years constitutes a \u201cwaiver\u201d under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) in respect of any or all of those years; and\nIf yes,\nWhether, as a result, any of the reassessments for the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years is considered issued pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) and not subsection 152(4.2); and\nThe impact on the Respondent\u2019s motion seeking an order to quash the appeals for the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years, and any relief requested.\n[35] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) allows the Minister to reassess a taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period if the taxpayer has filed a waiver. Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) provides as follows:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n\u2026\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[36] The request for submissions provided the Appellant with an additional opportunity to submit why the appeals for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years might bevalid. However, the Appellant did not address any of the substantive issues outlined in the request. Instead, the Appellant accused me of being biased in favour of the Respondent, a claim that is entirely without foundation.\n[37] The Respondent submits that none of the Appellant\u2019s T1 adjustment requests constitutes a waiver. The Respondent argues that the Appellant did not intend for any of the T1 adjustment requests to act as a waiver and the T1 adjustment requests do not contain the required information to qualify as waivers. The Respondent further submits that the Minister clearly exercised discretion in reassessing the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years[34] under subsection 152(4.2), and that the Appellant was made aware of this. The Minister did not reassess under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii).\n[38] This Court and the Federal Court of Appeal considered a similar issue in Kubbernus.[35] In Kubbernus the issue was whether a reassessment was issued under subsection 152(4.2) or paragraph 152(4)(b)(i). The Minister reassessed the taxpayer\u2019s 2000 taxation year, allowing for a capital loss carryforward.[36] This reassessment was triggered by the taxpayer\u2019s application for relief under \u201cTaxpayer Relief\u201d legislation, and stated that the Minister adjusted the taxpayer\u2019s tax return under the fairness provisions of the ITA, so no notice of objection could be filed.[37] Nonetheless, the taxpayer objected to the reassessment and appealed the subsequent notice of confirmation.[38] The Respondent filed a motion to strike the taxpayer\u2019s appeal on the basis that the appeal was not properly instituted because the reassessment was issued under subsection 152(4.2), and no objection can be made to a subsection 152(4.2) reassessment.[39]\n[39] The taxpayer in Kubbernus argued that the reassessment was issued under subparagraph 152(4)(b)(i) and not subsection 152(4.2), so the taxpayer was not prohibited from objecting to the reassessment and appealing to this Court.[40] Taken together, subparagraph 152(4)(b)(i) and subsection 152(6) extend the permitted reassessment period from three to six years, allowing the Minister to carry back losses to prior taxation years. According to the taxpayer, it was not necessary for the Minister to resort to subsection 152(4.2) to issue the reassessment because the reassessment was issued within six years.[41] Angers J. disagreed with the taxpayer:\n[30] In addition, the evidence does not disclose that any of the conditions set out in subsection 152(4), which are required in order for the Minister to be able to assess after the normal assessment period, have been met here. No evidence was adduced that would permit me to conclude that the October 2006 reassessment was issued pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(b)(ii) or subsection 152(6) of the Act. The evidence, on the contrary, supports a finding that the reassessment was made under the \"fairness\" legislation, and the Minister reassessed for the appellant's 2000 taxation year in accordance with his request. As a consequence, no valid objection may be made; hence, no appeal can be filed before this Court.[42]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[40] The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Tax Court decision.[43] Based on the evidence, the only conclusion available to the Tax Court judge was that the reassessment was issued under subsection 152(4.2).[44]\n[41] A T1 adjustment request may, in certain circumstances, be considered to constitute a waiver for the purposes of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii). For example, this Court in Remtilla determined that the T1 adjustment requests filed by the taxpayers constituted waivers, based on a conclusion that the taxpayer intended to file waivers.[45] However, based on the evidence, that is not the case here. The correspondence from the Appellant reflects a series of T1 downward adjustment requests, initiated by the Appellant. There is no suggestion that the Appellant intended for the relevant taxation years to \u201cremain open\u201d, consistent with a waiver. The responses from the Minister also reflect that the reassessments were issued under subsection 152(4.2). The following is an excerpt of the letter sent by the Minister to the Appellant on October 1, 2020, responding to the Appellant\u2019s T1 adjustment requests for his 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years under the Taxpayer Relief Provisions:\nI am writing in response to your correspondence asking the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to adjust income earned in the Dominican Republic and to recognize expenses incurred in the generation of this foreign income in the tax years of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. As well, we have reviewed the deductions claimed in the 2017 tax year, and verified that the correct exchange rate was used at the time of reassessment of the 2013, 2015 and 2016 tax years. As this request relates to statute-barred years, it falls under the purview of Taxpayer Relief Provisions.\nAs described in Circular IC07-1, the Taxpayer Relief Provisions provide for discretion to issue a refund or reduce the amount owed for any statute barred tax year that ended within ten years before the calendar year when the taxpayer filed the request. To follow the guidelines, please refer to this Information Circular on the Canada Revenue Agency web site at www.canada.ca\/en\/revenue-agency.[46]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[42] There is no evidence that a waiver was either requested by the CRA or that the Appellant intended to provide a waiver by submitting the T1 adjustment requests. Rather, the evidence supports the contrary \u2013 that the Appellant sought downward adjustments and the Minister exercised its discretion under subsection 152(4.2) when it reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years. As such, the Appellant is prohibited from appealing the assessments for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\n[43] For the foregoing reasons, I have concluded that the Minister issued reassessments on October 22, 2020 for the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2015, and 2016 taxation years under subsection 152(4.2). Pursuant to subsection 165(1.2), the Appellant is not able to object to those reassessments. As a condition precedent to instituting a valid appeal under subsection 169(1) for each of those taxation years has not been met, the Appellant is prohibited from appealing the assessments. The Respondent\u2019s motion to quash is granted in respect of the appeals for the 2013, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\nVIII. THE 2014 (AND 2018) TAXATION YEARS\nA. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n[44] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the Appellant did not file a notice of objection or request an extension of time to file a notice of objection for the 2014 taxation year by the deadlines provided under the ITA. The Respondent submits that, for the 2018 taxation year, the Appellant did not timely file a notice of objection but did apply to the Minister for an extension of time to file an objection within the time required. The Respondent will therefore consent to an application for an extension of time to the Court for the Appellant\u2019s 2018 taxation year.\n[45] The Appellant did not address the Respondent\u2019s arguments with respect to the alleged failure to timely file a notice of objection or request an extension of time to file a notice of objection and the potential impact on appeal rights. The Appellant takes the position that in respect of the income earned by him in the Dominican Republic, he is not governed by the rules of the ITA which prescribe limitation periods for filing a notice of objection or a request for an extension of time to file a notice of objection. I disagree for reasons provided further below. First, I address the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\nB. Law\n[46] Pursuant to paragraph 165(1)(a), an individual who objects to an assessment must file a notice of objection on or before the earlier of the following:\nThe day that is one year after the tax-filing due date for the year: the tax-filing due date for individuals who carried on a business in the year is June 15th of the following year;[47] and\nThe day that is 90 days after the day the notice of assessment was sent: the definition of \u201cassessment\u201d in subsection 248(1) is non-exhaustive, and provides that an \u201cassessment\u201d include a reassessment.\n[47] Where a taxpayer has not filed an objection to an assessment or reassessment within the time limits set out in subsection 165(1), the taxpayer can apply for an extension of time to file the objection under a two-step process.\n[48] First, pursuant to section 166.1, a taxpayer who wishes to file a notice of objection beyond the normal time limit must apply to the Minister for an extension of time. The section 166.1 application must be made within one year of the expiration of the time limit for serving a notice of objection. Pursuant to subsection 166.1(7), an extension may only be granted where the taxpayer demonstrates:\na. That within the time otherwise limited for serving a notice, the taxpayer either was unable to act or to instruct someone to do so, or had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment;\nb. That it would be just and equitable to grant the application; and\nc. That the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[49] Second, pursuant to section 166.2, if the CRA refuses the application under section 166.1, or if 90 days have elapsed following service of the application and the CRA has not notified the taxpayer of the decision, the taxpayer may apply to this Court for an extension of time to file a notice of objection. Paragraph 166.2(5)(a) requires that the original application under section 166.1 was made within one year after the expiration of the statutory time limit for serving a notice of objection or making a request.\nC. Analysis\n(1) The 2014 taxation year\n[50] The Appellant was initially assessed for the 2014 taxation year on June 26, 2015. The Minister reassessed the Appellant for the 2014 taxation year by notice dated December 11, 2017. The deadline for the Appellant to serve on the Minister a notice of objection to the latter reassessment, pursuant to subparagraph 165(1)(a)(ii), was March 12, 2018 (determined as the later of the date that is one year after the Appellant\u2019s filing due date for the 2014 taxation year \u2013 being June 15, 2016[48] \u2013 and 90 days after the day of sending the December 11, 2017 notice of reassessment \u2013 being March 12, 2018). Based on the affidavits of Sadruddin Suleman, I have determined that the Appellant did not file a notice of objection on or before March 12, 2018. The Appellant filed a notice of objection dated November 22, 2020, which was outside the limitation period.\n[51] The time limit for the Appellant to serve an application with the Minister for an extension of time to object to the notice of assessment dated December 11, 2017, expired on March 12, 2019 pursuant to paragraph 166.1(7)(a). The Appellant sent a letter to the CRA dated December 6, 2020 applying for an extension of time to object to the 2014 taxation year, which was received by the CRA on December 14, 2020. The extension request was not filed within the time prescribed by paragraph 166.1(7)(a).\n[52] As the Appellant has not met the criterion set out in paragraph 166.2(5)(a) \u2013 that the application for an extension of time be made within one year of the time otherwise limited by subsection 165(1) - this Court does not have jurisdiction to grant an extension of time to file a notice of objection under section 166.2.\n[53] In Bormann[49], the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed this Court\u2019s decision to quash appeals for taxation years with respect to which the appellant had not served a notice of objection or applied to the Minister to extend the time to file a notice of objection. The Court summarized the following well established principles:\n[3] Section 169(1) of the Income Tax Act obliges a taxpayer to serve Notice of Objection in order to appeal an assessment. In other words, service of a Notice is a condition precedent to the institution of an appeal.\n\u2026\n[5] Once it is clear that no application for an extension of time was made, the law is clear that there is no jurisdiction in the Tax Court to further extend the time for equitable reasons.[50]\n[54] As a condition precedent to instituting a valid appeal under subsection 169(1) for the 2014 taxation year has not been met (a valid notice of objection has not been filed), the Respondent\u2019s motion to quash is granted in respect of the appeal for the 2014 taxation year.\n(2) The 2018 taxation year\n[55] The Appellant was initially assessed for the 2018 taxation year on August 19, 2019. The Minister reassessed by notice dated September 12, 2019. The deadline for the Appellant to serve on the Minister a notice of objection pursuant to subparagraph 165(1)(a)(ii) was June 17, 2020 (being the later of one year from the filing deadline of June 17, 2019[51] and 90 days after the notice of reassessment, this latter date being December 11, 2019). Based on the affidavits of Sadruddin Suleman and the Appellant\u2019s submissions, I have determined that the Appellant filed a notice of objection on November 22, 2020, after the June 17, 2020 deadline.[52]\n[56] The time limit for the Appellant to serve an application on the Minister for an extension of time to object pursuant to paragraph 166.1(7)(a) expired on June 17, 2021. The Appellant sent a letter dated December 6, 2020 (received by the CRA on December 14, 2020) applying for an extension of time to object to the 2018 taxation year. The Minister has not yet made a decision with respect to that application.\n[57] The Respondent acknowledges that the Appellant made an application to the Minister for an extension of time to object within the time limit, for his 2018 taxation year. If the Appellant makes an application to the Court for an extension of time to object, the Respondent is prepared to consent to the application on the grounds that it would meet the requirements in section 166.2.\n[58] The Appellant may apply to this Court for an extension of time to object to the September 12, 2019 reassessment for the 2018 taxation year.\n(3) The Appellant\u2019s \u201coverarching\u201d arguments, applicable to the 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 taxation years\n[59] As already noted, the Appellant takes the position that in respect of income earned by him from business carried on in the Dominican Republic, he is not governed by the procedural rules of the ITA for the objection and appeals process. I disagree. I have considered the Appellant\u2019s arguments but they do not affect the outcome in this motion.\n[60] The starting point, which the Appellant acknowledges, is that he is a resident of Canada for purposes of the ITA. Division I of the ITA, which deals with Returns, Assessments, Payment and Appeals (sections 150-168.1) and Division J of the ITA, which deals with Appeals to the Tax Court of Canada and the Federal Court of Appeal (sections 169-180), apply to all taxpayers under the ITA. A \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is defined in section 248 to include \u201cany person whether or not liable to pay tax\u201d. Regardless of the Appellant\u2019s arguments to be made in the underlying appeals that he is not liable to tax under the ITA on income from certain sources, he is a taxpayer for purposes of the ITA and is subject to the rules for compliance, assessments and appeals as provided in Divisions I and J of the ITA.\n[61] The Appellant correctly states certain basic principles with respect to Canada\u2019s tax treaties. Canada has concluded the Canada-DR Tax Treaty with the Dominican Republic. Canada is party to the Vienna Convention, which influences the interpretation and application of tax treaties.[53] Article 26 of the Vienna Convention provides that \u201cEvery treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith\u201d. Article 27 provides that \u201cA party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty\u201d. As a party to the Canada-DR Tax Treaty, Canada agrees to abide by the provisions and to perform its obligations thereunder in good faith.\n[62] As a general rule, Canada adheres to the principle that a treaty prevails over domestic law to the extent of any inconsistency between them.[54] The Appellant argues that since neither the Canada-DR Tax Treaty nor the Vienna Convention prescribes any limitation periods or other procedural rules with respect to Canadian income tax, there is an inconsistency that must be resolved in favour of reliance on the Canada\u2011DR Tax Treaty and the Vienna Convention. The Appellant argues that because the underlying appeal is \u201cinternational\u201d \u2013 involving income earned in the Dominican Republic \u2013 the provisions of the ITA that address tax administration and enforcement do not apply, but the provisions of the Canada-DR Tax Treaty and the Vienna Convention do. The end result, according to the Appellant\u2019s arguments, appears to be that there are no procedural rules or limitation periods applicable to his current dispute with the CRA.\n[63] The Appellant relies on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Zingre[55] for the proposition that Canada may not rely on the provisions of domestic law for \u201cnon-compliance\u201d with the provisions of a treaty. Zingre is not relevant here. The case dealt with whether an order allowing commission evidence should be granted in connection with Swiss nationals resident in Switzerland and charged with criminal offences in Canada. The relevant treaty was an Anglo-Swiss Treaty of 1880.\n[64] More fundamentally, there is no \u201cinconsistency\u201d between the procedural rules in the ITA on the one hand and the Canada-DR Tax Treaty and the Vienna Convention on the other hand; there is no \u201cnon-compliance\u201d with the international agreements. There is only one set of procedural rules applicable to the administration and enforcement of Canadian federal income taxes, which is in the ITA. There are no parallel rules in the Canada-DR Tax Treaty or Vienna Convention[56]. This does not mean there is an inconsistency or non-compliance. Just the opposite; there is no possible inconsistency or non-compliance. The Canada-DR Treaty and the Vienna Convention do not function as the Appellant argues; the argument is without merit.\n[65] The Appellant also argues that the CRA dealings with the Appellant constitutes an abuse of Articles 1, 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[57] More particularly, the Appellant\u2019s allegation appears primarily based on a concern that non-lawyers employed by the CRA came to legal conclusions on the Appellant\u2019s tax position and on the CRA\u2019s delay of process. As addressed below in the context of the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike, complaints about the conduct of the CRA are not within the jurisdiction of this Court and are not relevant to the motion before me.\n[66] In summary, I do not accept these \u201coverarching\u201d arguments made by the Appellant. Regardless of the arguments to be made as to why he is entitled to relief in the underlying appeals, the Appellant must comply with the statutory limitation periods and other procedural requirements under the ITA to file an objection and commence an appeal in this Court. The Appellant\u2019s arguments do not affect my decision to grant the Respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appeals for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\nIX. THE MOTION TO STRIKE\n[67] I have granted the Respondent\u2019s motion to quash the appeals for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years. The Respondent does not contest that the appeal for the 2017 taxation year has been properly constituted and the Respondent indicates that it will agree to a request for an extension to file a notice of objection for the 2018 taxation year, in order that the appeal for that year may be properly constituted. The result is that the motion to strike remains relevant only for the 2017 and 2018 taxation years.\nA. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n[68] The Respondent submits that the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal, or sections thereof, should be struck (with leave to file an Amended Notice of Appeal). The Respondent submits that if left unamended, the Notice of Appeal would otherwise prejudice or delay the hearing as various sections are not relevant to the determination before the Court. The position is based on the following grounds:\n1.The Appellant has not met a condition precedent to instituting his appeal;\n2.The section pleads evidence and\/or describes the content of the evidence pleaded;\n3.The section relates to impugning CRA behavior;\n4.The section raises an invalid Charter[58] argument; and\n5.The section pleads law and arguments rather than material facts under the section labelled \u201cmaterial facts relied on\u201d.\n[69] The Appellant\u2019s response is that the Notice of Appeal will not prejudice or delay the hearing, but rather it is the Appellant who has already suffered prejudice and delay in its dealings with the CRA. The Appellant relies on Jordan[59] to support the argument about prejudice arising from delay and cites the time periods for the CRA responses in various dealings with the Appellant as giving rise to that prejudice. As I explain in further detail below, the conduct of the CRA is not within the jurisdiction of this Court. The sole issue which the Court will decide at a hearing of the underlying appeals is the correctness of the assessments.\nB. The Law\n[70] The relevant provisions of the Rules are section 48 and subsections 53(1) and 53(3), which provide as follows:\n48. Every notice of appeal shall be in Form 21(1)(a), (d), (e) or (f).\n\u2026\n53. Striking out a Pleading or other Document.\n(1) The Court may, on its own initiative or on application by a party, strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document:\n(a) may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal;\n(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;\n(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court; or\n(d) discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal or opposing the appeal.\n\u2026\n(3) On application by the respondent, the Court may quash an appeal if\n(a) the Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal;\n(b) a condition precedent to instituting an appeal has not been met; or\n(c) the appellant is without legal capacity to commence or continue the proceeding.\n[71] The requirements of Form 21(1)(a) include the following:\nFORM 21(1)(a)\n[\u2026]\n(c) Relate the material facts relied on,\n(d) Specify the issues to be decided,\n(e) Refer to the statutory provisions relied on,\n(f) Set forth the reasons the appellant intends to rely on,\n(g) Indicate the relief sought, and\n(h) Date of notice.\n[72] The following principles apply to a motion under subsection 53(1) of the Rules:\n1. To strike out a pleading or part of a pleading, it must be plain and obvious that the position has no reasonable prospect of success.[60]\n2. In a motion to strike out a pleading, the burden to show it is plain and obvious that the pleading has no prospect of success rests on the Applicant.[61]\n3. Unless the facts are manifestly incapable of being proven, the facts as stated in the notice of appeal must be taken as true.[62] The respondent cannot attack the notice of appeal to challenge assertions of fact.[63]\n4. A motion judge should avoid usurping the function of the trial judge in making determinations of fact or relevancy. Such matters should be left to the trial judge who hears the evidence.[64]\n5. The test to grant a motion to strike is stringent, and the power to strike out a pleading must be exercised with great care.[65] The approach must be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed to trial.[66]\n[73] I have concluded that various sections of the Notice of Appeal should be struck, with leave to file an Amended Notice of Appeal. The conclusions reached on the grounds raised by the Respondent are summarized below. The details are in Appendix A, under the column \u201cRelief Granted and Reasons\u201d.\n(a) Ground #1: Strike if a condition precedent is not met\n[74] A condition precedent to instituting an appeal has not been met for the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years. All references to those taxation years in the Notice of Appeal shall be struck.\n(b) Ground #2: Strike if pleading evidence\n[75] In Beima, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed this Court\u2019s decision to strike 97 pages of affidavits from the taxpayer\u2019s notice of appeal, on the basis that \u201c[E]vidence is to be introduced at the hearing of the appeal and not as part of the notice of appeal.\u201d[67] All evidence in the Notice of Appeal, including all references to the Exhibits and the Exhibits themselves, shall be struck. The relevance and admissibility of the evidence will be determined at the hearing of the underlying appeals.\n[76] Many passages from the Notice of Appeal (and the Exhibits) which I order to be struck contain descriptions of the correspondence between the Appellant and the Respondent in respect of the underlying issues in the appeal. To the extent that the correspondence contains facts and legal argument on which the Appellant relies, they may be included in an Amended Notice of Appeal.\n(c) Ground #3: Strike if pleadings allege CRA misconduct\n[77] The sections that pertain to complaints about the conduct of CRA officers shall be struck, pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Rules, as CRA conduct is irrelevant to this Court\u2019s mandate. This Court does not have jurisdiction to set aside an assessment on the grounds of CRA misconduct. The Federal Court of Appeal in JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. stated:\n[83] The Tax Court does not have jurisdiction on an appeal to set aside an assessment on the basis of reprehensible conduct by the Minister leading up to the assessment, such as abuse of power or unfairness: Ereiser v. Canada, 2013 FCA, at paragraph 38; Roitman, supra at paragraph 21; Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd., supra at paragraph 6; Bolton v. Canada, [1996] 3 C.T.C. 3, 96 D.T.C. 6413 (Fed. C.A.) \u2026 If an assessment is correct on the facts and the law, the taxpayer is liable for the tax.[68]\n[78] In Johnson, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed this Court\u2019s decision to strike paragraphs from a notice of appeal relating to the following:\nThe administrative act of the Minister setting up a GST account;\nCollection actions of the CRA and of the Minister;\nThe amount of time the Minister took to address the Appellant\u2019s notice of objection; and\nPurported abuse of process with respect to the issuance of a notice of assessment.[69]\n[79] The basis for the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was:\n[4] The issue for the Tax Court of Canada in this case will be to determine whether each assessment issued under the Act and that is under appeal to that Court properly reflects the correct amount of net tax owing pursuant to that Act by the person who was assessed. The motivation of the Minister in issuing such assessments or any collection action taken by the Minister in relation to such assessments is not relevant to this inquiry.[70]\n[80] The Appellant argues that striking sections of the Notice of Appeal that deal with CRA behaviour will effectively deny him the opportunity to argue that Canada is acting \u201cin bad faith\u201d and contrary to Article 26 of the Vienna Convention. Article 26 of the Vienna Convention requires that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by it in good faith. I disagree. The Appellant is entitled to argue reliance on the provisions of the Canada-DR Tax Treaty and the Vienna Convention in respect of the underlying issues in the appeals, but not with reference to allegations of CRA behaviour or delay of process.\n[81] Similarly, the Appellant\u2019s allegations that CRA conduct has infringed the Charter of the United Nations and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights or, for allegedly providing legal advice, constituted \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d under the Criminal Code[71] are outside the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada and are ordered struck.\n(d) Ground #4: Pleading Charter arguments\n[82] Like all courts, this Court has certain powers where a person's rights and freedoms under the Charter have been infringed, but those powers must be exercised within the jurisdiction that Parliament has conferred on the Court.[72]\n[83] Here, the Appellant\u2019s Charter argument relates to his alleged treatment by the CRA. The Appellant argues that his equality rights under subsection 15(1) have been infringed because:\nHe is not being treated \u201cequally\u201d to the CRA employees with whom he has had dealings. More specifically, he argues that this Court should not allow CRA employees, who are not lawyers, to provide legal advice. The Appellant submits that if non-CRA employees did the same, they would be committing misrepresentation, and facing criminal charges; and\nHe is being discriminated against by the CRA because of his Dominican citizenship.\n[84] There is no merit to the Appellant\u2019s argument under subsection 15(1) of the Charter that CRA employees are providing \u201clegal advice\u201d to taxpayers. It is yet another variation of the Appellant\u2019s argument impugning the CRA\u2019s behaviour, which I have already found to be outside the jurisdiction of this Court. Passages relating to this argument are to be struck from the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal.\n[85] The Appellant alleges that he is being discriminated against because of his Dominican citizenship, but provides no detail. This too appears to be a complaint about CRA process and on this basis should be struck from the Notice of Appeal. If the Appellant has a legal argument regarding discrimination pertaining to the underlying issues in the appeals, that legal argument may be included in an Amended Notice of Appeal.\n(e) Ground #5: Compliance with Form 21(1)(a)\n[86] Section 48 of the Rules requires every notice of appeal to be in Form 21(1)(a), (d), (e), or (f). Form 21(1)(a) requires the notice of appeal to include the material facts, issues, statutory provisions and reasons relied on and relief sought. This is not just a formality, but a requirement so that the issues are properly defined for discovery and trial.[73] The Appellant must delineate between material facts relied on and the law and argument sections in an Amended Notice of Appeal.\nX. CONCLUSIONS\n[87] The Respondent\u2019s motion to quash is granted in respect of the Appellant\u2019s 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\n[88] The Respondent\u2019s motion to strike certain portions of the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal is granted, in part, as set out in more detail in Appendix A. The Appellant is granted 60 days, from the date of this decision, to file an Amended Notice of Appeal. The Respondent is granted an extension of time to file its Reply to the Amended Notice of Appeal, to 60 days after the Amended Notice of Appeal is filed and served.\nXI.

In addition, this specific letter indicates that The Appellant should file a T4002 Self-Employed Business Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income, and the T-2125 Statement of Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income for The Appellant\u2019s income in the Dominican Republic, referring to the Income Tax of Canada (ITA The Appellant denied because its violate the United Nations \u201cVienna Convention of the Law of the Treaties\u201d done in Vienna, Austria on 23 May 1969, and ratified by Canada, on October 14, 1970, in its Article 26 \u201cPacta sun servanda\u201d,Article 27 Internal Law and observance of treaties\u201d, and Article 31 \u201cGeneral Rule of interpretation\u201d. This case is even worst, because as far as The Appellant knows, Mr. Salvatore Pace, Service Complaint Office who signed the letter on behalf of The Respondent, is not a lawyer, therefore he is providing legal services within The Respondent organization to taxpayers, without being a lawyer, in the opinion of The Appellant is called misrepresentation. Therefore, based on the \u201cFruit of the Poison Tree\u201d doctrine2, all correspondent signed by Mr Pace on behalf of The Respondent must be \u201cNull\u201d in full, and not be considered in any way in this case. In addition, there is a doctrine that indicates the following: \u201cNo one is obliged to do what the law does not command\u201d and in this case, the applicable law is not the Income Tax Act (ITA) of Canada, but the Convention#1, supra. Exhibit # 19.\nStrike the entire paragraph as it relates to complaints about the conduct of CRA tax officers and pursuant to the ground #1 submitted for the excerpt #13 above.

Complaints about the conduct of the CRA are not relevant to determining the correctness of the reassessments at issue and are therefore not within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. However, to the extent that the underlined text reflects legal argument pertaining to the substantive underlying issues in the appeals and not the alleged conduct of the CRA, and on which the Appellant still relies, that legal argument may be included in an Amended Notice of Appeal.\nPages 7-8, paragraph (c)(24): On February 18, 2020, The Appellant responded to The Respondent letter signed by Mr. Pace where The Appellant indicated the above mentioned Article XIV of the Convention#1, supra, and highlighted in the second page, section 2) F), Article XIV, Section 1, a: second line \u201cif he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities; in that case, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other Contracting State\u201d. The reason why 'file Respondent has never recognized that The Appellant met the criteria in Article XIV, Section 1, a) of the Convention#1, supra is that it will admit that the Respondent has violated the Convention #l, supra, in this specific section of it to discriminate against Dominican citizens. Consequently, The Respondent is violating the United Nations \u201cThe Vienna Convention of the Law of the Treaties, Vienna, Austria, 1969, as well as The Appellant's Universal Declarations of Human Rights in Its Articles 1, 2, and 7. and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. Exhibit # 20.\nStrike the underlined portion of the paragraph starting with \u201cindicated\u201d and ending by \u201cContracting state\u201d as the Appellant is pleading evidence and pursuant to the ground #1 submitted for the excerpt #2 above.

Strike the reference to \u201cExhibit #20\u201d based on the ground #2 submitted for the excerpt #2 above.\nThe relief requested is granted. 1. The first part of the underlined text from \u201cindicated\u201d to \u201cContracting State\u201d describes the content of Exhibit #20, which is evidence. 2. The second part of the underlined text from \u201cThe reason why\u201d to \u201cCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u201d appears to reflect complaints about the conduct of the CRA which are not relevant to determining the correctness of the reassessments at issue and are therefore not within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. The wording of this section suggests an argument under the Charter on the basis of discrimination based on Dominican citizenship, but this is not at all clear as no reasons are provided. If the underlined text does reflect legal argument regarding discrimination pertaining to the substantive underlying issues in the appeals and not the alleged conduct of the CRA, that legal argument may be included in an Amended Notice of Appeal. 3. The reference to Exhibit #20 should be struck as Exhibit #20 is evidence.\nPage 8, paragraph (c)(25): On October 1, 2020, The Respondent submitted a letter signed by Ray Halvorsen, Manager, Audit Division, Tax Sendees Office, Toronto West-Thunder Bay related to the audit of the taxation years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, where he indicates among other things, in Section 1. Expenses Incurred for the Generation of Foreign Income, Subsection 1.1 Home Office Expenses, in an Excel spreadsheet that the Appellant \u201cPortion Claimed\u201d was 10.33% of the Home Office Expenses and that The Respondent \u201cPortion Allowed\u201d was 6.28% of the Home Office Expenses, therefore The Respondent indicated how much The Appellant has as a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State (Canada) for the purpose of performing his activities. The appropriate interpretation as can be supported based on \u201cThe Vienna Convention of the Law of the Treaties, Vienna, Austria, 1969, and the Convention#1, supra is that the Original State (the Dominican Republic) is the state where the income had been originated, which initiate the legal discussion and that the other Contracting State (Canada), is the State that collects taxes based on the Original State income tax declaration of The Appellant, and has nothing to do with a taxpayer being resident or not of any of these States, because if the Appellant does not file income in the Original State (the Dominican Republic), the Other State (Canada) could never claim taxes from the Appellant, as of the Convention#1, supra is in place since 1976. Exhibit #21\nStrike the portion of the paragraph staring with \u201cindicates\u201d and ending with \u201chis activities\u201d as the Appellant is pleading evidence and pursuant to the ground #1 submitted for the excerpt #2 above.

Strike the reference to \u201cExhibit #21\u201d based on the ground #2 submitted for the excerpt #2 above.\nThe relief requested is granted in part. 1. The first part of the underlined text from \u201cindicates\u201d to \u201chis activities\u201d describes the content of Exhibit #21, which is evidence and should be struck. 2.

The Convention, supra (1) is an international law on which The Appellant from the beginning based his claims, and therefore should be respected as indicated in the United Nations \u201cThe Vienna Convention of the Law of the Treaties, Vienna, Austria, 1969\u201d, in its Article 27 \u201cInternal Law and Observance of the Treaty\u201d that \u201ca party may not invoke the provision of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and therefore, as the Convention#1, supra does not indicate statutes of limitation, The Respondent must accept any claims from the Appellant related to the Convention#1, supra at any given time.

June 15 is the filing deadline where the Appellant carries on a business. As the Minister assessed the Appellant to allow various expenses in computing income of a business, I have based my analysis on the premise that the filing deadline was June 15. In any event, whether the deadline was April 30 or June 15, it does not affect my conclusions that:\nThe Appellant did not object on a timely basis or file an extension request on a timely basis for the 2014 taxation year; and\nThe Appellant did not object on a timely basis but did file an extension request on a timely basis for the 2018 taxation year.\n[49] Bormann v.

Section 26 of the Interpretation Act states that \u201cWhere the time limited for the doing of a thing expires or falls on a holiday, the thing may be done on the day next following that is not a holiday.\u201d\n[52] The Appellant filed a notice of objection for the 2018 taxation year on November 22, 2020 (Notice of Appeal at Exhibit 22).\n[53] Canada assented to the Vienna Convention on October 14, 1970.

Scott Wilkie, International Taxation in Canada, 3rd ed (Markham: LexisNexis, 2014) at 43.\n[55] Zingre v. The Queen et al, [1981] 2 SCR 392.\n[56] The stated purpose of the Canada-DR Tax Treaty is to avoid double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital. The treaty acknowledges that each country imposes tax, and each country agrees to cooperate in order to avoid taxation not in accordance with the treaty. The Canada-DR Tax Treaty accepts that each country adheres to its own set of rules for the administration and enforcement of its domestic laws concerning taxes, but agrees to exchange information as is necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of the treaty and the domestic laws concerning taxes covered by the treaty. See Article XXVI of the Canada-DR Treaty regarding Exchange of Information.\n[57] On December 10, 1948, Canada voted to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Within Canada, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has played a seminal role in the development of human rights law, including the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights in 1960, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, proclaimed in 1982 (see William A. Schabas, \"Canada and the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" (1998) 43:2 McGill, L J 403). However, as clarified by the Federal Court in Canada (Minister of National Revenue) v. MacIver, 2002 FCT 877, citing Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817:\n[5] \u2026\n(c) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 \u2026 does not have the force of law such that it could be used to strike down the application of the impugned provisions of the Income Tax Act. International treaties and conventions are not part of Canadian law unless they have been implemented by statute. Such a document is only used as an aid to interpreting domestic law.\n[Emphasis in original.]\n[58] Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11.\n[59] R v.

Overview\n[1] These are appeals from determinations made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under the Canada Pension Plan (\u201cCPP\u201d) and the Employment Insurance Act (\u201cEIA\u201d) that Mr. Swinden, the Intervenor in these appeals (the \u201cIntervenor\u201d), was employed by All Sports Marketing Inc. (\u201cAll Sports Marketing\u201d or \u201cthe Appellant\u201d) in insurable and pensionable employment during the period from January 1, 2017 to July 11, 2017 (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nII. Factual Background\n[2] I heard from two witnesses: Mr. Swinden, who agrees with the Minister\u2019s determination, and Mr. Donato, who does not.\n[3] Mr. Donato testified first. He is the founder and shareholder of All Sports Marketing. All Sports Marketing provides targeted digital marketing services to organizers of outdoor sporting events such as marathons. These events are often staged to raise funds for charitable purposes.\n[4] All Sports Marketing uses emails and social media to promote events. Mr. Donato testified that he was also the owner and founder of Good Times Running Inc., an event planning organization that owns and operates three sporting events in Toronto.\n[5] Mr. Donato insisted that the Intervenor was hired as an independent contractor. The Intervenor could determine how and when he provided services to the Appellant. He could work from home, from coffee shops or from his car. How the Intervenor provided his services did not matter. What counted for Mr. Donato was results. According to Mr. Donato, that is why the Intervenor was compensated for his services under a commission\u2011based pay structure.\n[6] It was quickly established that Mr. Donato\u2019s evidence was irreconcilable with the agreement he drafted and signed with the Intervenor on behalf of the Appellant in November of 2015 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Mr. Donato became argumentative when this was pointed out to him by the Respondent\u2019s counsel on cross\u2011examination. I attach little weight to his evidence for the reasons that follow.\n[7] What stands out from a clause\u2011by\u2011clause review of the Agreement is that it reads like an employment contract. Notably, the Agreement is defined as an employment contract. The Appellant is referred to as \u201cthe Employer\u201d, and the Intervenor is referred to as \u201cthe Contractor\u201d, although this is inconsistent and at times he is also referred to as \u201cthe Employee\u201d.\n[8] For example, article 3 of the preamble provides:\n[T]he Employer desires to employ the Contractor and the Employee has agreed to accept and enter such employment upon the terms and conditions set out in the Agreement.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[9] Article 2 of the Agreement provides that the Intervenor was hired to provide his services on a full\u2011time basis.\n[10] Article 4 of the Agreement provides:\nThe Employer agrees to employ the Contractor as a Sales Rep, and the Contractor agrees to be employed on the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. The Contractor agrees to be subject to the general supervision of and act pursuant to the orders, advice and direction of the Employer.\nSimilarly, article 6 of the Agreement provides:\nThe Contractor agrees to abide by the Employer\u2019s rules, regulations and practices, including those concerning work schedules, vacation and sick leave, as they may from time to time be adopted or modified.\nArticle 5 specifies:\nThe Contractor will perform any and all duties now and later assigned to the Contractor by the Employer.\nThis included securing sales for related parties and\/or domain names owned directly or indirectly by Mr. Donato such as MyNextRace.com, RoadRaceResults.com and Good Times Running Inc.\nArticle 10 of the contract provides:\nThe Employer will reimburse the Contractor for all necessary expenses incurred by the Employee while travelling pursuant to the Employer\u2019s directions and approval.\n[11] There are additional provisions that are incompatible with a contract for services. For example, article 15 provides:\nThe Contractor agrees to devote full\u2011time efforts to his or her duties as Contractor of the Employer.\nThis is not a clause that would be agreed to by someone providing services as an independent contractor.\n[12] Similarly, articles 16 and 17, which appear under the heading \u201cAvoiding Conflict of Opportunities\u201d, are not clauses that would be agreed to by someone in business for himself or herself. These clauses specify that any business opportunity relating to or similar to the Employer\u2019s current or anticipated business opportunities belongs to the Employer. The Intervenor was barred from pursuing such opportunities without the written consent of the Appellant.\n[13] The impression I am left with is that an employment contract was used by Mr. Donato as a model to prepare the Agreement. From the evidence, I infer that Mr. Donato simply substituted the term \u201cContractor\u201d for the term \u201cEmployee\u201d without modifying the substance of the employment agreement, which he used as a template to prepare the Agreement.\n[14] In summary, the use of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d rather than \u201cemployee\u201d appears to be little more than ineffective window dressing.\nIII. Analysis\n[15] Distinguishing employment from an independent contractor arrangement can be challenging because working relationships are subject to constant change. The distinction turns on the following definitions of \u201cemployment\u201d:\na) Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA defines it as:\nemployment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise.\nb) Subsection 2(1) of the CPP provides as follows:\n\u201cemployment\u201d means the state of being employed under an express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, and includes the tenure of an office.\n[16] The leading case on this issue is Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1] which was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. [2] The question is always whether or not the person \u201cis performing [the services] as a person in business on his own account\u201d. [3] Sagaz summarizes the test enunciated in Wiebe Door as follows:\n. . . In making this determination, the level of control the employer has over the worker\u2019s activities will always be a factor. However, other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her own equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the degree of financial risk taken by the worker, the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker, and the worker\u2019s opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks.\nIt bears repeating that the above factors constitute a non\u2011exhaustive list, and there is not set formula as to their application. The relative weight of each will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. [4]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[17] It is important to bear in mind, however, that the intention of the parties is also relevant to the extent that it is reflected in the facts of the case. The expressed intention of the parties is not determinative of this issue. Justice Mainville of the Federal Court of Appeal made the following clarification in 1392644 Ontario Inc. o\/a Connor Homes v. Minister of National Revenue: [5]\n37 . . . the legal status of independent contractor or of employee is not determined solely on the basis of the parties[\u2019] declaration as to their intent. That determination must also be grounded in a verifiable objective reality.\n[18] This statement reflects common sense legal reasoning. In some cases, particularly those involving new entrants to the workplace or lower\u2011skilled employees, an inequality in bargaining power often exists. A person seeking employment may be faced with a take it or leave it approach to contractual negotiation.\n[19] The evidence demonstrates that this was the case in the matter at hand. I agree with the observation that was made on this point by the Respondent\u2019s counsel in her closing arguments. Mr. Donato, as the owner of the Appellant, sought to gain the advantages of two very different situations. On the one hand, the Intervenor was subject to the behavioural and financial control of the Appellant based on the actual terms and conditions of his employment as spelled out in the Agreement. On the other hand, in the absence of a challenge and a contrary determination, the Appellant could avoid the costs of mandatory payroll taxes for CPP contributions and employment insurance premiums, and of mandatory employment benefits and other minimum statutory benefits.\n[20] To protect against situations like those described above, Connor Homes mandates a two\u2011step analysis. First, the intention of the parties must be ascertained in order to determine what kind of relationship they wished to create. In the light of that intent, the second step is to analyze the facts of the case to determine whether the expression of the parties\u2019 intent conforms to the objective reality of their relationship. The purpose of this examination is to determine whether or not the worker \u201cis performing [the services] as a person in business on his own account.\u201d In this second step, the Court must apply the following Wiebe Door factors, namely (i) control, (ii) ownership, (iii) chance of profit, and (iv) risk of loss, to determine whether the factual reality reflects the subjective intention of the parties.\n[21] Mr. Donato insisted that Mr. Swinden agreed to provide his services as a contractor. To assist the Intervenor in satisfying his tax reporting obligations, Mr. Donato instructed the Intervenor to consult with the Appellant\u2019s external tax advisor, who instructed him on how to bill the Appellant for his services and file his tax returns as an independent contractor.\n[22] Mr. Donato is undoubtedly a good and experienced salesperson. I infer from the evidence that Mr. Swinden agreed to sign the Agreement without independent legal advice, acting solely on Mr. Donato\u2019s representations of the benefits that could be enjoyed by the Intervenor as an independent contractor.\n[23] I question whether Mr. Donato received independent tax advice with respect to the pros and cons of an employment relationship versus an independent contractor relationship. Undoubtedly, the Appellant\u2019s tax advisor was aware of the fact that the Appellant wished to avoid the costs of payroll taxes and statutory employment benefits. I infer from this that the only advice the Intervenor received was how to report his income as an independent contractor and to collect HST if and when required.\n[24] A final observation is merited here. Whether the Intervenor claimed expenses deductible only if he qualifies as an independent contractor has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal as that matter is not before me. Furthermore, paragraph 8(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act provides that a salesperson earning commissions may deduct expenses related to his or her employment when the preconditions outlined in that provision are satisfied. In many cases, expenses that are eligible for deduction under paragraph 8(1)(f) are similar to those deductible by persons in business for themselves in a similar situation.\n[25] As noted earlier, while the term \u201cContractor\u201d is used in the Agreement to designate the Intervenor\u2019s relationship as that of an independent contactor, the substance of the Agreement is irreconcilable with that designation. The actual terms and conditions that the Intervenor agreed to are commonly found in a contract of service rather than a contract for services.\n[26] I will now return to an application of the four Wiebe Door factors referenced earlier.\n(1) Control\n[27] Control, in the context of distinguishing employees from independent contractors, is often defined as the ability or right of a payer to exercise control over how and when a worker performs his or her duties. The more control the payer has over its personnel, the more the relationship will resemble that of employer\u2011employee. Similarly, the more independence workers enjoy in determining how they will execute their tasks and when they will do so, the more they will appear to be in business for themselves.\n[28] As noted earlier, I am satisfied that the Agreement allowed the Appellant to exercise behavioural and financial control over the Intervenor. Mr. Swinden\u2019s evidence confirms that the parties interacted with one another based on the terms and conditions of their Agreement. Nothing more is required to be said on this factor.\n(2) Tools\n[29] The evidence shows that Mr. Swinden worked on site 75 percent of the time. He used the corporation\u2019s stationery when required. He also printed out documentation on the corporation\u2019s printer. He had access to the Appellant\u2019s existing client information, which he accessed to solicit business.\n[30] Mr. Swinden acknowledged that he used his own laptop, his own phone and his own car in the performance of his duties. He was reimbursed gas and some expenses when travelling to carry out his duties.\n[31] On balance, this factor is neutral.\n(3) Chance of Profit \/ Risk of Loss\n[32] Mr. Swinden was required to carry out his duties personally. Unlike an independent salesperson, he could not subcontract his duties to others at his expense in the hope of increasing his commission sales revenue.\n[33] Mr. Donato submitted that Mr. Swinden bore a risk of loss. No sales meant no commission revenue. While this is true to some degree, Mr. Swinden\u2019s risk of loss was substantially mitigated by his entitlement to a base salary of $20 per hour for a 40\u2011hour work week.\n[34] Mr. Donato claimed that Mr. Swinden had more than one client. As noted earlier, article 4 of the Agreement provides that Mr. Swinden\u2019s duties included selling services for All Sports Marketing, MyNextRace.com, RoadRaceResults.com and Good Times Running Inc. As noted earlier, these domain names and entities are owned by Mr. Donato. If Mr. Swinden was truly an independent contractor, I believe that he would have preserved his ability to choose his own clients. This was not the case because he was required to provide his services to the Appellant on a full\u2011time basis.\n[35] In my opinion, this factor is indicative of a contract of service.\nIV. Conclusion\n[36] In my opinion, the Wiebe Door\/Sagaz factors favour a finding that Mr. Swinden was an employee of the Appellant. The objective reality of the situation is that the Appellant exercised control over how and when Mr. Swinden carried out his duties. For these reasons, I dismiss the appeals and confirm the Minister\u2019s decision that Mr. Swinden was an employee of the Appellant for the purpose of the CPP and EIA for the Relevant Period.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of March 2023.\n\u201cRobert J.

His counsel says that all of the conditions to qualify for such an extension have been satisfied. Crown counsel says they have not.\n[2] On September 30, 2019, the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) assessed Mr. Oliveira as a director of a numbered company under section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act and section 323 of the Excise Tax Act. Mr. Oliveira says that he was never a director of that company.\n[3] Mr. Oliveira disputed the assessments by objecting to each. He followed up with numerous communications with the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division and dealt with several CRA officials with a view to having the assessments vacated.\n[4] The CRA\u2019s Appeals Division eventually completed its review and sent notices of confirmation to Mr. Oliveira confirming the assessments. The CRA had decided not to vacate the assessments as Mr. Oliveira had requested.\n[5] Mr. Oliveira\u2019s next step, as described to him by the CRA in the notices of confirmation, was to institute appeals with this Court within the statutory 90-day period. Both notices specifically refer to that deadline. He missed it.\n[6] But even if one misses the 90-day deadline, both the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act offer a grace period of one year to apply to this Court for orders extending time to institute an appeal. Because he missed that deadline as well, I must dismiss Mr. Oliveira\u2019s applications.\nStatutory Provisions\n[7] The Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act allow an appeal of an assessment to be instituted with this Court within 90 days of the CRA sending a notice of confirmation of the assessment. Typically, a notice of confirmation is sent after the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division rejects the objection. That is exactly what happened here.\n[8] If an appeal is not instituted within those 90 days, an application for an extension of time to institute the appeal may be made to this Court if the application is made within one year of the 90-day deadline. Filing an application within that year is necessary, but not sufficient, for this Court to allow the application.\n[9] If the application is filed within one year after the 90-day deadline, the Court must then consider whether all of the other statutory conditions are satisfied, namely:\n(a) within the 90-day deadline the applicant (i) was unable to act or instruct someone else to act for them, or (ii) had a bona fide intention to appeal;\n(b) it would be just and equitable to grant the application;\n(c) the application was made as soon as circumstance permitted; and\n(d) there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.\n[10] The applicant has the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that each condition has been satisfied. [1]\n[11] The most important condition is the timeliness of the application as set out in paragraph 167(5)(a) of the Income Tax Act and paragraph 305(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act. The relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act are reproduced at Schedule \u201cA\u201d and the relevant provisions of the Excise Tax Act are reproduced at Schedule \u201cB\u201d.\n[12] As I have concluded that Mr. Oliveira did not apply for the orders on time, it is unnecessary to consider any of the other statutory conditions.\nFindings of Fact\n[13] With respect to the Income Tax Act assessments, the Crown filed an affidavit from Mr. Steve Kos of the CRA. He stated that the CRA confirmed the assessments by way of notice of confirmation dated May 10, 2021 [2] and attached a copy of the notice of confirmation to his affidavit. The notice is dated May 10, 2021. [3] It informed Mr. Oliveira that his objection was disallowed and that the assessments were confirmed. It also advised Mr. Oliveira that:\nAccording to section 169 of the Income Tax Act, if you disagree with this decision, you may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada within 90 days from the date of the notice of confirmation. For information on how to file an appeal, see the publication RC4443-2, Appealing income tax assessments to Tax Court of Canada, at canada.ca\/cra-publication-rc4443-2. You can also get up to date information by going to the Tax Court of Canada website at tcc-cci.gc.ca.\n[14] With respect to the Excise Tax Act assessment, the Crown filed an affidavit from Mr. Andy Cheung of the CRA. He stated that the CRA confirmed the assessment by way of notice of confirmation sent by registered or certified mail as required by the Excise Tax Act. [4] Mr. Cheung mailed the notice himself and described the steps he took in doing so. He also followed up on its delivery to Mr. Oliveira that occurred on May 17, 2021. [5] Mr. Cheung attached a copy of the notice of confirmation that informed Mr. Oliveira of the confirmation of the assessment. It also advised Mr. Oliveira that:\nSection 306 of the Excise Tax Act says that, if you disagree with this decision, you may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada within 90 days from the date of the notice of confirmation. For information on how to file an appeal, see the publication RC4443-3, Appealing GST\/HST assessments to Tax Court of Canada, at canada.ca\/cra-publication-rc4443-3. You can also get up to date information by going to the Tax Court of Canada website at tcc-cci.gc.ca.\n[15] In cross-examination, Mr. Oliveira told the Court that he read the original notices of confirmation while he was in the bathroom. While reading the notices, he had to leave the bathroom suddenly. After that, the bathroom flooded. The flood destroyed the original notices of confirmation, so he asked CRA\u2019s Appeals Division for replacements. The CRA provided them under cover of a letter dated August 26, 2021. [6]\n[16] Although Mr. Oliveira could not recall when he received the original notices of confirmation, he did not deny having received them. [7] Indeed, he was reading them in the bathroom at some point during the summer of 2021. In light of the statutory presumptions in subsection 244(14) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 335(10) of the Excise Tax Act, and the affidavit evidence of the CRA, I find that the original notices of confirmation were mailed to Mr. Oliveira on May 10, 2021. [8]\n[17] Although the 90-day period to institute his appeals to this Court had expired by the end of August 2021 when he received the replacement notices, Mr. Oliveira was still within the statutory one-year grace period to apply to this Court for orders extending time to institute those appeals. He did not make those applications until September 13, 2022. By then, the statutory one-year grace period had expired.\n[18] After considering all of the evidence, I find the following:\nSeptember 30, 2019\nThe CRA issues director\u2019s liability assessments under section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act and section 323 of the Excise Tax Act against Mr. Oliveira.\nDecember 19, 2019\nMr. Oliveira objects to the assessments by serving a notice of objection on the Minister of National Revenue under subsection 165(1) of the Income Tax Act and filing a notice of objection with the Minister of National Revenue under subsection 301(1) of the Excise Tax Act. [9]\nMay 10, 2021\nThe CRA sends a notice of confirmation of the assessments under section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act to Mr. Oliveira, as required by subsection 169(1) of that Act and sends a notice of confirmation of the assessment under section 323 of the Excise Tax Act to Mr. Oliveira, as required by subsection 301(5) of that Act.\nAugust 8, 2021\nThe 90-day deadline for Mr. Oliveira to institute appeals with this Court under subsection 169(1) of the Income Tax Act and section 306 of the Excise Tax Act against the assessments expires.\nAugust 9, 2021\nMr. Oliveira attempts to fax a letter to the \u201cCRA Western Appeals Intake Centre\u201d in which he continues to make representations to CRA\u2019s Appeals Division in respect of the assessments. [10] He does not intend to send the fax to this Court.\nAugust 26, 2021\nAt Mr. Oliveira\u2019s request, the CRA sends replacement copies of the notices of confirmation originally sent on May 10, 2021. Having received those copies, he is aware of what he needs to do to appeal to this Court. [11] Although he was out of time to institute his appeals with the Court, he was in time to apply for extensions of time to institute the appeals within the statutory one-year grace period.\nAugust 8, 2022\nThe statutory one-year grace period for Mr. Oliveira to apply to this Court for extensions of time to institute appeals under paragraph 167(5)(a) of the Income Tax Act and paragraph 305(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act expires.\nSeptember 13, 2022\nMr. Oliveira applies to this Court for extensions of time to institute appeals under subsection 167(1) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 305(1) of the Excise Tax Act.\nSubmissions for Mr. Oliveira\n[19] Counsel for Mr. Oliveira relied heavily on the decision of Justice Boyle in Hickerty v The Queen, 2007 TCC 482. In that case, Justice Boyle found that Mrs. Hickerty intended to file a notice of appeal with this Court but sent it to the wrong address \u2013 an address belonging to the CRA that had been provided to her by the CRA. Justice Boyle\u2019s findings of fact included that:\n1) The taxpayer sought to appeal to this Court virtually immediately upon hearing of CRA Appeals\u2019 decision on her objections;\n2) She prepared and mailed her notice of the appeal to the Court;\n3) Her mistake was to wrongly address it. She called CRA\u2019s information line for the Court\u2019s address and mailed it to the address she was given. Unfortunately, that was an incorrect address. . . . [12]\n[20] In such circumstances, Justice Boyle decided not to count the period during which Mrs. Hickerty was under a reasonable but mistaken belief that she validly instituted an appeal in the statutory one-year grace period provided by paragraph 167(5)(a) of the Income Tax Act. [13]\n[21] On the evidence before me, however, I find that Mr. Oliveira did not intend to send his fax of August 9, 2021 to this Court but intended to send it to the CRA instead. In any event, even if Mr. Oliveira believed that his fax somehow instituted his appeals, that belief would not have been reasonable. [14] He failed to take seriously the words of the original notices of confirmation advising him on the next step if he disagreed with the CRA\u2019s decision. Nor did he take seriously the same words in the replacement copies of the notices of confirmation that he received three months later. Indeed, he conceded in cross-examination that after receiving the replacement copies, he was aware of what he needed to do to appeal to this Court. [15]\n[22] Counsel for Mr. Oliveira also relied on Breathe E-Z Homes Ltd. v MNR, 2014 TCC 122 in support of his case. That decision, too, is distinguishable on its facts. Dealing with a similar statutory scheme, Justice Bocock allowed an application for an extension of time by Breathe E-Z Homes, notwithstanding that that it missed the extended deadline. It had properly instructed counsel, but counsel dropped the ball. Justice Bocock\u2019s findings of fact included that:\n(a) the applicant did what it reasonably could to appeal the assessments;\n(b) the applicant was under a reasonably held misapprehension that everything was proceeding properly; and\n(c) the applicant was diligent and mindful of the deadlines and time frames of which it was made aware. [16]\n[23] Here, the opposite is true. Having read the clear words of the notices of confirmation, I find that:\n(a) Mr. Oliveira failed to do what he could reasonably have done to appeal the assessments;\n(b) Mr. Oliveira was not under a reasonably held misapprehension that everything was proceeding properly; and\n(c) Mr. Oliveira was less than diligent as he ignored the deadline to appeal to this Court \u2013 a deadline about which the CRA specifically informed him in the original and replacement notices of confirmation.\n[24] Finally, counsel for Mr. Oliveira asked me to take into account fairness and equity with particular reference to:\n(a) Mr. Oliveira\u2019s plea that he had never been a director of the numbered company;\n(b) Mr. Oliveira\u2019s inability to pay the assessments of some $180,000; and\n(c) Mr. Oliveira having been a mere 36 days late in filing his applications.\n[25] In rejecting counsel\u2019s request, I can do no better than to cite the authorities relied on by Justice Lafleur at the end of her reasons in Pietrovito v The Queen, 2017 TCC 119:\n[86] Finally, here are my last comments: no consideration of fairness or equity can be of assistance to the Appellant as this Court is a statutory court. As explained in Odebala\u2011Fregene, supra [2015 TCC 44]:\n22 Factoring in the nature of the specialized statutory scheme of the Act and that this Court is a statutory Court, considerations of fairness do not apply. In his submission, respondent counsel referred to the Federal Court of Appeal in Chaya v Canada, 2004 FCA 327, 2004 DTC 6676 (FCA), which noted that such grounds are not within the power of this Court. In paragraph 4 of the decision, Rothstein JA, as he then was stated:\n4 \u2026 It is not open to the Court to make exceptions to statutory provisions on the grounds of fairness or equity. If the applicant considers the law unfair, his remedy is with Parliament, not with the Court.\n[26] Had Mr. Oliveira taken seriously the words of the original notices of confirmation, he would have instituted his appeals with this Court within the 90\u2011day time limit. But even if he first became aware of the next step in late August 2021 when he received the replacement notices, he would have been in a position to file applications with this Court for extensions of time to institute his appeals within the one-year statutory grace period.\nConclusion\n[27] Under subsection 169(1) of the Income Tax Act and section 306 of the Excise Tax Act, Mr. Oliveira had 90 days from May 10, 2021 to institute his appeals with this Court. Those 90 days expired on August 8, 2021. Under paragraph 167(5)(a) of the Income Tax Act and paragraph 305(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act, Mr. Oliveira had until August 8, 2022 to apply for orders extending time to institute his appeals with this Court. He did not file those applications until September 13, 2022.\n[28] I must, therefore, dismiss Mr. Oliveira\u2019s applications for orders extending time to institute appeals under subsection 167(1) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 305(1) of the Excise Tax Act. I will do so without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 17th day of March 2023.\n\u201cDavid Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nSchedule \u201cA\u201d\n90-Day Deadline to File a Notice of Appeal of Income Tax Act Assessments\n165(3) On receipt of a notice of objection under this section, the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, reconsider the assessment and vacate, confirm or vary the assessment or reassess, and shall thereupon notify the taxpayer in writing of the Minister\u2019s action.\n***\n169(1) Where a taxpayer has served notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied after either\n(a) the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the notice of objection and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer that the Minister has vacated or confirmed the assessment or reassessed,\nbut no appeal under this section may be instituted after the expiration of 90 days from the day notice has been sent to the taxpayer under section 165 that the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed.\nOne-Year Grace Period to File an Application for an Extension of Time to File a Notice of Appeal of Income Tax Act Assessments\n167(1) Where an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada has not been instituted by a taxpayer under section 169 within the time limited by that section for doing so, the taxpayer may make an application to the Court for an order extending the time within which the appeal may be instituted and the Court may make an order extending the time for appealing and may impose such terms as it deems just.\n***\n167(5) No order shall be made under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time limited by section 169 for appealing;

In the absence of evidence to the contrary (which does not include Mr. Oliveira\u2019s failure to recall when he received it), I decline the invitation by Mr. Oliveira\u2019s counsel to find that the notice of confirmation under the Income Tax Act was not mailed on the date of the notice.\n[4] Subsection 301(5) of the Excise Tax Act.

(\u201cCSS\u201d) is appealing Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan assessments in respect of 2016 through 2018. The sole issues are whether the corporation\u2019s workers were engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment as defined in the EI and CPP legislation. These questions require the Court to decide if the workers were employees or were independent contractors in providing their services to CSS.\n[2] CSS is in the business of providing security guard services to its clients in the construction, retail, warehousing and trucking sectors. It had a history of being a subcontractor to a large security services firm. CSS carries on business as Canadian Security Services. In the years in question, Mr. Hasan Shahid was the company\u2019s sole shareholder and director. Mr. Shahid represented CSS in these appeals and was the only witness.\nI. Applicable Law.\n[3] I have summarized the relevant law in Loving Home Care Services v. M.N.R. 2014 TCC 71 (affirmed 2015 FCA 68) as follows:\n[3] The applicable law in appeals such as these is fully and clearly set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 85. I will not reproduce all of paragraphs 23 and 33 through 41 of Justice Mainville\u2019s reasons.\n[4] The legal issue to be decided is simply whether an individual worker is performing her personal care worker services as her own business on her own account.\n[5] This requires me to first decide whether subjectively, based upon the facts, circumstances and evidence in the particular case, there was a mutual understanding or common intention between the parties regarding their relationship as either employment or independent contractor.\n[6] At this stage, a Court can consider, among other things, the extent to which a worker understood the differences between an employment or independent contractor relationship, the relative bargaining position strengths and weaknesses, and the extent to which such evidence, which can typically be expected to be self\u2011serving, is corroborated by and consistent with the other evidence placed before the Court.\n[7] The answer to this question is not determinative. The parties can not agree to the correct legal characterization of their work relationship as if it were just another term or condition of their work relationship rights, obligations, duties and responsibilities. A declared and agreed intent to a particular characterization of the work relationship as employment or independent contractor must, in fact, be grounded in a verifiable objective reality.\n[8] If the parties have a common agreed intended characterization of their relationship, this Court must determine if the overall objective reality of their working relationship sustains, and is consistent with, their subjective intent.\n[9] This second step requires the Court to consider and weigh the traditional Sagaz\/Wiebe Door[1] factors of control over the work and the worker (including the extent of subordination of the worker), the provision of tools, material, credentialing and equipment needed for the worker to do the work, and the extent of the worker\u2019s financial upside and downside risks regarding the services provided by her.\n[10] In this second step, the Court may again consider the parties\u2019 intent, along with the actual behaviour of the parties and any written agreement between them. In Royal Winnipeg Ballet v. M.N.R. (F.C.A.)[2] the Federal Court of Appeal had similarly said the traditional Sagaz\/Wiebe Door factors must be considered \u201cin the light of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d\n[11] This second step is otherwise the same as how the Court would proceed in cases where there is no common shared intention regarding the characterization of the work relationship by the parties.\nII. Intention\n[4] Mr. Shahid\u2019s evidence is that both CSS and its workers intended for the workers to be independent contractors. He relies upon the company\u2019s Subcontractor Service Agreement in which workers make such an acknowledgement.\n[5] In this case I am unable to discern whether or not there was a common shared intention. A party\u2019s intentions are inherently subjective, although courts are generally also interested in whether a person\u2019s stated intentions are consistent with the objective evidence. In this case, none of the workers testified, so I don\u2019t know what they intended, what they understood was in the contract, or what they understood their acknowledgement and pledge in that the agreement covered. Given the material inconsistencies and ambiguities within CSS\u2019s standard form contract, as described below under Control, and absent the testimony of any workers - including Mr. Shahid\u2019s relatives, I do not have sufficient, consistent, credible evidence to conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, the workers intended to be independent contractors.\n[6] I will therefore proceed to the next stage of considering and weighing the relevant factors from Sagaz\/Wiebe of control over the work and worker, provision of tools\/supplies and the extent of the workers\u2019 financial upside and downside risks regarding their services.\nIII. Control\n[7] As in many cases the issue of the payor\u2019s control of the work and of the workers is a very significant factor in this case.\n[8] On its website, CSS offers its clients the ability to \u201chire highly trained security guards\u201d, that they \u201cprovide meticulous training and ensure that our guards are fully bonded, insured and licenced\u201d, and that this includes \u201ctraining of new licenced applicants and security officers to meet or exceed Ministry standards\u201d, \u201cfrequent training to improve employee performance\u201d and \u201cquarterly performance assessments\u201d. The CSS also said \u201cposting of open position is a way of informing employees and potential applicants of available positions within the company\u201d.\n[9] Mr. Shahid did not respond to these parts of its website by saying it reflects current practice but not how CSS operated in 2016 to 2018. Instead, he said these references to training and the monitoring of performance were mistakes by his media consultants, and were just media statements, and restated that in fact CSS has never provided training. The only requirement was that guards had to be properly licensed by the province before being hired. I have no idea what, if any, training is involved in obtaining a licence. This gives rise to overall concerns about the witness\u2019 description of CSS\u2019 operations and involvement with its guards.\n[10] CSS\u2019s Subcontractor Service Contract includes the following:\nA requirement that the worker cannot leave their assigned post or job site during scheduled work\nPaid breaks during work hours\nIt refers to the agreement as a \u201ccollective agreement\u201d\nIt has two paragraphs headed Immigration Law Compliance\nIt has a ninety day probationary period, which allows for termination without notice\nFailure to comply with minimum notice requirements leads to Disciplinary Action\nIn the section specifying that there is no overtime day, it is tied to the 44 hour provincial threshold for employees and suggests workers should subcontract any work over 44 hours to another worker\nIt specifies that the company must be informed at least thirty days in advance of vacation, and that approval is required and is at the discretion of the company, and limits the number of those unpaid vacation days to sixty per year\nIt provides that the costs of uniform and equipment provided will be paid by pay cheque deductions\nIt provides for Holiday Pay, which was described by Mr. Shahid as the higher rate of pay for statutory holiday under Ontario employment legislation\nIn his testimony, Mr. Shahid said that the company assumes Ontario minimum wage laws applied to its subcontractors\nIt has a complex Harassment Policy and Violence Policy that contemplate an Investigation, Formal and the Informal Grievances, Corrective Actions, Disciplinary Action, Suspension and Suspension Periods, and possible Termination.\n\u00b7 It includes reference to Termination Pay Cheque which shall be \u201cdisbursed according to provincial and\/or federal law\u201d\n[11] All of the above appear to reflect somewhat the type of control that is more expected in employment situations than in independent contractor situations.\n[12] The Subcontractor Service Contract clearly contemplates that a worker may work for others, including other security services firms, as long as it complies with the agreement. In the case of security guard workers, this does not appear inconsistent with many types of employment such as restaurants servers, retail workers, etc. at the minimum wage range level. I do not find this a helpful consideration in this particular case.\n[13] Mr. Shahid confirmed that he gave a description of the work, that he outlined the work expectations for shifts offered at clients\u2019 sites, that he gave the workers guidelines on how to accomplish their tasks, and that he gave workers follow-up and feedback on their work from the view of both CSS and its clients.\n[14] Mr. Shahid stressed that no one from CSS supervised or controlled the work done by the workers or how it was done. Workers were told by CSS who to report to at their client\u2019s premises and that a particular person will give them instructions. The effect of the supervision or control of a worker by the payor\u2019s client has been previously been considered by the court to reflect relevant control and supervision by the payor in comparable circumstances. In paragraph 46 of Loving Home Care it is written:\n[46] With respect to the role of the families in having day-to-day communications about the care needed or provided, consistent with Justice Woods\u2019 decision in Dean (Ana\u2019s Care & Home Support) v. Canada (National Revenue), 2012 TCC 370, it is the ability of Loving Home Care to control and direct how the duties are performed that is most significant, not how often it had to be or was exercised to such an extent. Also, I agree with Justice Woods\u2019 observation that in an in-home care giving context, since the workers contracted with Loving Home Care and not with Loving Home Care\u2019s clients, any directions given by Loving Home Care\u2019s clients which the workers were expected to comply with, amounted to control exercised over her by virtue of her obligations to Loving Home Care.\nThis applies equally in this case.\n[15] CSS also relies on the fact that most of its workers were not regular full\u2011time or part-time workers. The employment contemplated in the definitions of insurable and pensionable employment is not limited to regular workers. It is broad enough to include what may be described as casual employees. Irregular, casual workers may be common in a gig economy, but are not excluded from being casual employees once relevant factors are considered and weighed.\n[16] Having regard to the evidence in this case, I believe CSS\u2019s control over the work, and the subordination of the workers to CSS, clearly weigh in favor of employment over independent contractor status.\nIV. Tools, licensing and supplies\n[17] CSS required workers to wear marked security guard uniforms, though at times CSS\u2019s clients did not want CSS logos or branding on uniforms or vehicles. Workers used their own cars and, when needed, magnetic decals and security lights identifying them as security were provided by CSS. Again, at times CSS\u2019s clients did not want CSS branding on the vehicle, or wanted unmarked vehicles. Workers were required to have their own cell phones while working. In the circumstances, and given the absence of any worker testimony about how and when these were used and who bore their costs etc., I consider tools and supplies, etc. to be a neutral factor in this case. Mr. Shahid\u2019s testimony was a little too fluid on these points, and I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the workers paid for their own insurance and bonding etc. from their minimum wage pay cheques without having heard from a single worker. It also remains unclear how much workers actually paid for their CSS uniforms and supplies.\n[18] For working at construction sites, workers were required to supply their own hard hats, safety boots and security vest. These are the type of things that might be required in either independent contractor or employment situations and thus are also neutral considerations.\nV. Financial upside opportunity and downside risks\n[19] CSS could not identify any financial opportunities or risks for workers from their work that were of a business, commercial or entrepreneurial nature from working for CSS. There was no evidence regarding any worker having any other clients in their security guard subcontracting business. The workers would have needed to testify to that. Workers could accept more hours of work or negotiate a higher hourly rate to be more profitable. Workers might incur a loss if they paid too much for their car or cell phone, or if they damaged the property of a CSS client, or if they became subject to some of the financial penalties set out in the CSS Subcontractor Service Contract.\n[20] These are not generally the type of financial considerations that are helpful in deciding whether a worker is truly operating his or her own business or is instead working as an employee for a business carried on by someone else.\n[21] In this case I find that the financial considerations of opportunity for profit and risk of loss also weigh in favor of employment over independent contractor status.\n[22] It can also be noted with respect to my consideration and weighing of the above factors that nothing changed in regard to these factors after the years in question, after CSS re-characterized the workers as employees and started making all appropriate employee withholdings and remittances of employer and employee amounts following the issuance of the EI and CPP assessments in question. Just as employee versus independent contractor status is not something one can simply choose regardless of the underlying realities, it is also something that cannot simply be re-characterized absent changes in the underlying realities.\n[23] On balance, having had regard to, and weighing, the relevant factors, I find that the workers were engaged in both insurable employment and pensionable employment.\n[24] The appeals are dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 22nd day of March 2023.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 34\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-3371(EI)\n2019-3372(CPP)\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCANADIAN SECURITY & MOBILE PATROL LTD.

Introduction\n[1] This is an appeal by 3792391 Canada Inc. (hereinafter referred to as 391 or the Appellant) from assessments made under Part XIII of the Income Tax Act, RSC, 1985, c 1 (5th Supp) (Act), for the 2011 to 2016 taxation years. Under the statutory scheme set out in Part XIII, the Act provides for tax to be paid by non-residents who receive property income from Canadian residents and imposes an obligation on residents to withhold and remit the tax payable by the non-resident.\n[2] David Siscoe, an exercise specialist, is a shareholder of the Appellant, which operates Siscoe Gym. Mr. Siscoe entered into a lease for the premises located at 501-4175 Sainte Catherine West in Westmount, Quebec (unit 501). Although he was the tenant of unit 501, the Appellant paid the rent on his behalf during the taxation years under appeal.\n[3] By notice dated October 26, 2018, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) assessed the Appellant for failure to withhold and remit Part XIII tax payable on rental income received by Sebastiana Trimarchi, the owner of unit 501 during the relevant period, as well as interest and penalties, on the basis that Ms. Trimarchi was a non-resident.\nII. Preliminary Matters\n[4] At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for the parties each made a motion to the Court.\nAppellant\u2019s motion to strike part of the Reply\n[5] Counsel for the Appellant made a motion to strike parts of the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact in the Reply on the basis that the assumptions in paragraphs 11 c), d), e) and f) contain conclusions of law. The relevant paragraphs read as follows:\n11. In determining the Appellant\u2019s non-resident tax liability for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years, pursuant to Part XIII, section 215, the Minister relied on the following assumptions of fact:\n[\u2026]\nc) the Condo was owned by Sebastiana Trimarchi (the \u201cNon-resident\u201d);\nd) Sebastiana Trimarchi is a non-resident living in Italy;\ne) during taxation years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the appellant paid the following amounts to a non-resident [\u2026];\nf) upon paying the Non-resident gross rents, no withholdings were made by the Appellant, pursuant to Part XIII of the Act;\n[6] The Appellant argued that assumptions of fact play a critical role in tax litigation in light of their impact on the burden of proof placed on the Appellant. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the assumptions that state that Sebastiana Trimarchi is a non-resident include conclusions of law. Counsel submitted that the Minister can conclude that Ms. Trimarchi is a non-resident but she has to state the facts on which this conclusion is based. Counsel relied on a recent decision of this Court, Bluecove Management Ltd v R, 2022 TCC 126 [Bluecove], in which Justice Lafleur found that the Minister must extricate the factual components of a conclusion of mixed fact and law. In Canada v Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd, 2003 FCA 294 at paras 25-26, cited in Bluecove at para 29, the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that in pleading assumptions of fact, the Minister cannot plead conclusions of law. The Federal Court of Appeal added that the Minister may only assume the factual components of a conclusion of mixed fact and law such that the taxpayer knows exactly which factual assumptions it must demolish in order to succeed.\n[7] The question of residence is one that a court determines on the basis of the application of rules to a set of circumstances such that the finding of residence or non-residence is a conclusion of law based on a set of facts. Hence, I agree with counsel for the Appellant that the Minister\u2019s assumptions include a conclusion of law. In the circumstances, I agreed to strike the word non-resident from paragraphs 11 c) and d) of the Reply. In paragraphs 11 e) and f), the word non-resident was struck and replaced with Sebastiana Trimarchi.\nRespondent\u2019s motion to amend paragraph 11 e) of the Reply\n[8] Counsel for the Respondent made a motion to amend paragraph 11 e) of the Reply to correct the amounts of gross rent that the Appellant paid in 2011 and 2016. On consent by counsel for the Appellant, the motion was granted. Hence the correct amounts of gross rental payments the Appellant made during the 2011 to 2016 taxation years are as follows:\nTaxation year\nGross Rent\n2011\n$16,650\n2012\n$33,650\n2013\n$33,900\n2014\n$33,900\n2015\n$33,900\n2016\n$22,600\nIII. Issue\n[9] The issue in this appeal is whether the Minister was correct in imposing Part XIII tax on the Appellant for its failure to withhold and remit tax on the amounts it paid as rent to Sebastiana Trimarchi. More precisely, the question is whether the Appellant paid rent to a non-resident person such that it is liable for failure to withhold and remit the tax payable on the rental income on behalf of the non-resident person.\nIV. Background\n[10] David Siscoe is the tenant who occupied unit 501 as his personal residence. He first signed a lease for the premises with Anjar Investments Ltd. (Anjar) in May 1996. Joseph Trimarchi signed the lease on behalf of Anjar. Mr. Siscoe testified that he made the rental payments to Joseph Trimarchi for a period but that, at some point, Joseph asked him to start paying the rent to one of his brothers.\n[11] I note that according to the information filed with the Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec (Exhibit A-1, Tab 6), Anjar has three shareholders, namely, Joseph Trimarchi, Graziella Trimarchi and Sebastiana Trimarchi. Natalina Mandato Trimarchi is Anjar\u2019s director.\n[12] In January 2006, Anjar and Natalina Mandato Trimarchi sold unit 501 to Sebastiana Trimarchi (Exhibit A-1, Tab 3). Mr. Siscoe testified that he was not aware that Sebastiana Trimarchi was the owner of unit 501 since 2006.\n[13] In May 2010, Mr. Siscoe entered into a 3-year lease for unit 501 with Sebastiana Trimarchi signing as the lessor. In the section identifying the \u201clandlord (lessor)\u201d, she entered her address as 439, Boul de l\u2019Ile in Pincourt. However, in the section for signatures, right above Mr. Siscoe\u2019s signature showing he signed the lease on May 12, 2010, in Montreal, it shows that Sebastiana Trimarchi signed the lease on May 1, 2010, in Italy. In addition, she provided two phone numbers, a Montreal number and an international number. Mr. Siscoe testified that he highly doubts that he would have paid attention to either of those numbers. I note that the international number is the number at which the auditor reached Sebastiana Trimarchi in October 2018 (Exhibit R-11).\n[14] Mr. Siscoe testified that he saw Sebastiana Trimarchi in person three or four times over the years. He saw her in 2010 when she came over with the lease, once in 2014 or 2015 when she came accompanied with children and another time when she came alone around 2017. Mr. Siscoe described the encounters as uneventful.\n[15] Mr. Siscoe stated that, in 2011, 391 started to pay the rent for unit 501 on his behalf because \u201cit was easier from a bookkeeping point of view\u201d and it was accounted for in the shareholder loan account. The corporate bank account shows cheques were made out to Sebastiana Trimarchi by 391 every month starting in July 2011 until January 2016, the last bank statement entered into evidence.\n[16] Little can be gleaned from the email correspondence between Mr. Siscoe and Sebastiana Trimarchi introduced into evidence other than the fact that her email address ended in .it rather than .ca or .com and the fact that one email contains language that Mr. Siscoe recognized as most likely Italian, stating that he speaks Italian, although not that well.\n[17] Mr. Siscoe was adamant that he was never informed that Sebastiana Trimarchi was living in Italy, or in Canada. He acknowledged that neither 391 nor he withheld Part XIII tax.\nV. Scheme of Part XIII\n[18] Part XIII of the Act levies a tax on certain types of income paid to non-residents by a resident of Canada. Section 212 is a charging provision aimed at imposing a 25% tax on certain amounts a non-resident receives from a Canadian resident. More specifically, paragraph 212(1)(d) imposes a 25% tax on gross rent paid for the use or the right to use in Canada any property owned by the non-resident.\n[19] In order to ensure collection of the taxes payable by a non-resident, subsection 215(1) of the Act requires the Canadian resident to withhold the tax and remit it to the Receiver General of Canada. In circumstances where an agent pays an amount to the non-resident on behalf of a debtor, subparagraph 215(2) requires that the agent withhold and remit the tax. Under paragraph 215(6), a person who fails to withhold and remit is liable for the tax, as well as for a penalty and interest pursuant to subsections 227(8) and (8.3).\n[20] I hasten to add that section 216 authorizes a non-resident to elect to pay Part I tax on net rental income from real property in Canada rather than the 25% flat tax on gross rental payments. Generally, the difference between the tax liability under Part XIII and that under Part I is such that the election triggers a refund to the non-resident. There was no such election made in the circumstances of this case prior to the 2018 assessments raised against the Appellant.\n[21] In commenting on Part XIII of the Act, Professor Krishna described the withholding tax regime as a \u201cdifficult compromise\u201d and the \u201conly feasible way to tax the income of non-residents who do not carry on business in Canada\u201d (Vern Krishna, Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2018), vol. 2 at 580-581).\nVI. The Parties\u2019 Positions\nThe Appellant\u2019s position\n[22] The Appellant submits that it is not liable for Part XIII tax because it has rebutted the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident of Canada during the relevant period and further, that the evidence introduced by the Appellant is sufficient to show that she was living in Canada. Under these circumstances, the Appellant submits that the burden rests on the Respondent to show that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident.\n[23] In addition, the Appellant submits that for section 215 to apply, the resident Canadian payer must have knowledge that the payee was a non-resident. Further, an interpretation that knowledge does not play a role in the application of section 215 would result in an injustice to tenants. In the Appellant\u2019s view, since David Siscoe did not know that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident, section 215 should not apply to him. And, finally, the Appellant argues that the penalties ought not to apply because Sebastiana Trimarchi actively dissimulated her non-resident status.\nThe Respondent\u2019s position\n[24] The Respondent submits that, pursuant to subsection 215(1), the Appellant was required to withhold and remit Part XIII tax on the rent paid to Sebastiana Trimarchi because she was a non-resident. Hence, the Respondent submits that pursuant to subsection 215(6), the Appellant is liable for Part XIII tax payable and for the related penalties and interest under subsections 227(8) and (8.3).\n[25] In response to the Appellant\u2019s submission that the Minister was \u201ceasy\u201d on Ms Trimarchi but \u201chard\u201d on the Appellant, Counsel for the Respondent stated that everyone had been assessed as is expressly authorized under the Act. The Respondent argued that the Minister can assess a resident taxpayer for failure to withhold and remit Part XIII tax and assess, as well, the non-resident taxpayer for Part XIII tax. In support of her position, she referred to Solomon v R, 2007 TCC 654 at para 9, wherein Justice Miller, as she then was, found that subsection 215(6) does not shift the tax burden from the non-resident recipient to the resident payer. In my view, neither does subsection 215(6) shift the burden from the resident payer to the non-resident recipient, all of which can be assessed for Part XIII tax.\nVII. Analysis\n[26] Counsel for the Respondent submitted that for subsection 215(6) to apply, there are essentially three requirements: i) a resident of Canada has failed to withhold and remit tax; ii) on an amount taxable under Part XIII; and iii) an amount was paid to a non-resident. The Respondent argued that there is no dispute that the Appellant is a resident of Canada and further, that the Appellant failed to withhold and remit Part XIII tax on rent paid to Sebastiana Trimarchi. The evidence introduced at trial, including the Appellant\u2019s general ledger and banking statements, clearly shows that the Appellant paid rent to Sebastiana Trimarchi during the relevant period. I find that the Appellant comes within the purview of requirements i) and ii) above as a Canadian resident who has made rental payments on behalf of David Siscoe and has failed to withhold and remit. The element of section 215 on which the parties disagree is whether Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident of Canada from 2011 to 2016.\nResidence\n[27] Counsel for both parties referred to the seminal decision in Thomson v MNR, [1946] SCR 209 at para 47, wherein the Supreme Court of Canada found that \u201cresidence\u201d is not a term of invariable elements but rather, it is a highly flexible term with many shades of meaning which may vary according to the context, a term to which it is quite impossible to give a precise and inclusive definition. The Supreme Court added that residence is \u201cchiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question\u201d (Thomson at para 50).\n[28] Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the determination of residence can be complex and referred to this Court\u2019s decision in Biya v R, 2020 TCC 113, as an illustration of all the factors that a court might consider in determining residence. In considering the factors relevant to the particular circumstances of this case, Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Court should conclude that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a resident of Canada in light of her ties to this country and the lack of ties with Italy. The Appellant suggested that the following elements show Sebastiana Trimarchi had ties to Canada and form the basis to conclude that she was a resident of Canada:\n\u00b7 Sebastiana had family in Canada based on the evidence that her mother Natalina and her brother Joseph lived in Montreal (Exhibit R-11 and Transcript at 14).\nSeveral documents suggested that Sebastiana had an address in Canada. For example:\no according to the information filed with the Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec, her address as a shareholder of Anjar indicates a Montreal address at 4040, rue Jean-B.-Meilleur (Exhibit A-1, Tab 6);\no the 2006 deed of sale of unit 501 by Anjar to Sebastiana indicates her address to be unit 1402 at 4175, rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest in Montreal (Exhibit A-1, Tab 3);\no On the lease entered into with David Siscoe in 2010, Sebastiana indicated she signed in Italy but provided an address in Pincourt, Quebec (Exhibit A-1, Tab 2);\n\u00b7 Sebastiana had a bank account in Canada because the rental cheques were deposited in a TD Canada Trust account at a branch in Montreal (Exhibit R-6); and\n\u00b7 Sebastiana had a social insurance number indicating she was a resident of Canada at some point and there is no evidence to suggest that she ceased to be a resident.\n[29] Counsel acknowledged that these ties were \u201cnot a lot\u201d and added \u201cbut it is all that we have\u201d (Transcript, Vol 2 at 22). Counsel submitted that the Appellant had successfully rebutted the Minister\u2019s assumption that Sebastiana was living in Italy such that the Respondent bore the burden of making his case.\n[30] In addressing the issue of whether Sebastiana Trimarchi was a resident of Canada, the Respondent introduced evidence through the auditor, Choumele Jiofack. Ms. Jiofack testified that she was involved in auditing the appellant and explained that it was a secondary audit to that of the principal audit of David Siscoe. The principal audit led the auditor to request the Appellant\u2019s general ledger and bank account statements. In light of the information contained therein, the auditor concluded that the Appellant was paying David Siscoe\u2019s rent to Sebastiana Trimarchi and further that, rent was being paid to a non-resident.\n[31] As part of her audit procedures, Ms. Jiofack verified whether Sebastiana Trimarchi, the recipient of the rental payments was declaring this income. She discovered that Sebastiana Trimarchi had a social insurance number but did not file any income tax returns nor did she find any information returns such as those related to employment or interest income. In addition, other than providing her address at 1402-4175 Sainte Catherine Ouest, the Equifax report the auditor requested came back \u201cempty\u201d. Ms. Jiofack testified that, after consulting the land register, she was unable to find property, other than unit 501, tying Sebastiana to Canada.\n[32] Through information obtained from family members, Ms. Jiofack reached Sebastiana Trimarchi in Italy. I note that the telephone number used is the same one as that provided by Sebastiana on the lease she signed in 2010. During that conversation, Sebastiana stated that she was living in Italy. Ms. Jiofack testified that there was no contestation and no ambiguity that she was living in Italy and they had a discussion about Sebastiana\u2019s tax obligations as a non-resident.\n[33] The Respondent introduced into evidence a Federal Court Order granting a motion for security for costs in relation to Sebastiana Trimarchi\u2019s application to the Federal Court for judicial review of a decision by the Minister refusing her application for an extension of time to file income tax returns pursuant to section 216 of the Act for the years 2008 to 2015. In light of the objection from Counsel for the Appellant but with his consent, only part of the Application for judicial review was allowed to be introduced into evidence. Counsel for the Respondent argued that the part allowed into evidence showed that through her legal counsel, Sebastiana Trimarchi was seeking judicial review of a decision by which the Minister had denied her request for an extension of time to file under section 216, a provision that applies to non-residents.\n[34] Regarding the Canadian address that Sebastiana provided on the 2006 deed of sale to her of unit 501, Counsel for the Appellant suggested that this should be taken as her true address as the notary took no issue with the address and proceeded with the sale. In replying to this submission, Counsel for the Respondent argued that there was no evidence before the Court to suggest that the notary was required to verify the validity of her address as the purchaser of the unit. Counsel for the Respondent suggested that the other Canadian addresses Sebastiana Trimarchi provided could be addresses for service as they were the same addresses as that of relatives. The address provided was the same as that of Graziella Trimarchi on the information recorded with the Bureau du registraire des entreprises and the same as her mother\u2019s address on the deed of purchase and sale of unit 501. In support of her position that these addresses should not be accepted as evidence that Sebastiana Trimarchi lived in Canada, Counsel for the Respondent referred to this Court\u2019s decision in Kau v R, 2018 TCC 156 at paras 20-22. In that decision, Justice Russell found that statements as to residency can be wrong, intentionally or not, and should not unconditionally be accepted when there was no inquiry into whether the address provided was indicative of residence. I find that Sebastiana Trimarchi\u2019s unsworn statements for which there were no inquiries are not necessarily conclusive of her residential addresses during the relevant years.\n[35] Based on the evidence reviewed above, I find that it is more likely than not that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident of Canada during the relevant taxation years. I refer in particular to the following evidentiary elements as indicative of Sebastiana Trimarchi\u2019s non-residency, in no particular order:\nshe did not file any income tax returns and did not have any information returns showing income such as employment or interest income;\nthe absence of any links to property in Canada other than unit 501 which was rented out;\nan \u201cempty\u201d Equifax report;\nthe phone number at which the auditor reached her in Italy was the same as the phone number she provided on the lease she signed with David Siscoe in 2010;\nher statements to the auditor about living in Italy;\nthe addresses she provided on various documents were not the subject of any inquiry and were the same as that of family members living in Canada;\nthe application filed in the Federal Court for judicial review of the Minister\u2019s denial of her application for an extension of time to file returns pursuant to section 216 of the Act for 2008 to 2015, a provision that applies to non-residents; and\nthe email correspondence between her and David Siscoe in 2014 and 2015 suggesting she had an Italian email address.\nKnowledge requirement for Part XIII tax\n[36] Counsel for the Appellant argued that knowledge is required for subsection 215(6) to apply. More specifically, he submitted that if the payer does not have knowledge that the payee is a non-resident, the payer should not have to bear the consequences of Part XIII. In support of his submissions, the Appellant relied on this Court\u2019s decision in Curragh Inc v R, 94 DTC 1894 (Curragh). With respect, I find that the decision in Curragh is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case for three reasons: i) in the circumstances of that case, payment was made to a Canadian resident who was an agent for the non-resident payee and there is no such agent in this appeal; ii) in Curragh, the payer actually had knowledge that the payee was a non-resident; and (iii) Justice Mogan suggested that 215(6) is dependent upon the knowledge of the payer but added that he was not required to decide that precise issue on the facts of that case. Hence, in my view, the decision in Curragh cannot stand in support of the position that knowledge is required for subsection 215(6) to apply.\n[37] The Appellant further argued that an interpretation that would have subsection 215(6) apply to impose Part XIII tax on a tenant that has no knowledge that the landlord is a non-resident would be unjust and submitted that cannot be what the legislator intended. He implored the Court to choose an interpretation that is sensible, one that people can accept, rather than one that causes an injustice. Counsel acknowledged that the text of the provision does not contain a requirement that the payer have knowledge that the payee is a non-resident and stated he had no evidence of the legislator\u2019s intention.\n[38] The Appellant suggested that the general obligation to withhold and remit should be interpreted as providing for a defence of due diligence as has been recognized in the case law for the interpretation of some penalty provisions. I agree that the case law has consistently held that a taxpayer can present a due diligence defence with respect to some penalty provisions but I do not agree that a due diligence defence can be mounted with respect to the obligation to withhold and remit pursuant to subsection 215(6). Support can be found in Justice Hogan\u2019s decision in J.K. Reed Engineering Ltd v R, 2014 TCC 309 at para 17 wherein he stated: \u201cSubsection 215(6) of the Act is a charging provision that makes the payer liable for the payee's tax if the payer fails to deduct or withhold at the time of payment tax that is payable by the payee. In contrast, subsection 227(8) of the Act is a penalty provision. A due diligence defence can be mounted against the latter but not the former.\u201d It is worth reiterating that subsection 227(8) of the Act is an actual penalty provision for failure to withhold and remit any amount as required by section 215, added to support the collection of taxes imposed by the charging provision. I would add that, in any event, in this case, there is no suggestion nor evidence of due diligence on the part of the Appellant.\n[39] To summarize the Appellant\u2019s reasoning, since David Siscoe did not know, and had no reason to believe, that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident, section 215 should not apply to the Appellant.\n[40] Counsel for the Respondent argued that liability under subsection 215(6) is not dependent on the taxpayer\u2019s knowledge that payments were made to a non-resident. She submitted that when applying the textual, contextual and purposive interpretation mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Trustco v Canada, 2005 SCC 54, it is clear that there is no element of knowledge required to impose liability under subsection 215(6).\n[41] I agree with Justice Mogan\u2019s comments in Curragh, supra at para 24, wherein he asserted that \u201csection 215 is clear and not ambiguous. It does not need any aid to construction.\u201d I will nonetheless consider the history of the provision introduced as Bill 96 in 1933 (Bill C-96, An Act to amend the Income War Tax Act, 4th Sess, 17th Parl, 1933, cl 12 (first reading 5 May 1933). According to the information in Bill 96, the predecessor to section 215 was introduced to support the administration of the charging provision imposing tax on non-residents, itself applicable since 1923. At first reading, Bill 96 provided as follows:\n12. Section twenty-seven of the said Act is amended by adding thereto the following subsections:\n\u201c(3) Every person making any payment by any means whatsoever to a non-resident person on account of anything let, leased or used in Canada, or on account of royalties for anything used or sold in Canada shall deduct from every such payment twelve and one-half per centum thereof.\n(4) The amount so deducted shall be remitted to the Receiver General of Canada at the same time as the payment is made or credited to the non-resident person and shall be accompanied by a statement in the form prescribed by the Minister.[\u2026]\u201d\n12. This section is an enabling provision in support of section 27 of the Act, whereby all non-residents since 1923 have been liable for Canadian Income Tax on all rents and royalties. The provisions of the said section 27 as enacted in 1924 and applicable to the 1923 taxation period insofar as they deal with rents and royalties are as follows;\n\u201c27\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Or any non-resident person who lets or leases anything used in Canada or who receives a royalty or other similar payment for anything used or sold in Canada, shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Canada and to earn a proportionate part of the income derived therefrom in Canada.\u201d\nThe difficulty in administering this section has been that although non-residents have been liable for tax on rents and royalties since 1923, in the majority of instances such non-residents apparently have taken every means possible to avoid giving information, filing returns or admitting any liability under the Act, even though they were entitled to credit in their own country with respect to any income tax paid to Canada. By withholding a percentage of the rents and royalties at the source, the non-residents will be anxious to file his return showing his income from Canadian sources, together with any deductions on account of expenses applicable to such Canadian income, in order that the correct amount of his Canadian tax may be determined, as credit against the tax payable will be given for any amounts withheld and adjustments made accordingly.\n[42] Former subsection 215(6), added to the Act in 1960 under section 109(5) (Income Tax Act, RSC, 1952, c 148 as amended by 1960, c 43, s 29(2)) is virtually identical to the current version. There was no knowledge requirement in the withholding provision when it was first introduced and none has been added to the text since. In addition, when the legislator wants to limit a resident\u2019s liability to circumstances where they have knowledge or belief, it expressly does so. Subsection 116(5) is one such example.\n[43] With respect to the penalty imposed in this matter, I agree with the Appellant that a defence of due diligence is available but, of course, that defence has to be made out. The Appellant has not proven that it has exercised reasonable care to ensure compliance with its obligations. The courts have found that to be successful in mounting a defence to the imposition of a penalty, it is expected that the taxpayer seeking to invoke a due diligence defence must show that they exercised a high degree of diligence to comply with their obligations under the Act (see for example, Ogden Palladium Services (Canada) Inc v R, 2001 DTC 345). In the circumstances of this case, the Appellant took no steps to ensure compliance with its withholding obligations. Counsel submitted that the Appellant was justified in not taking steps to ensure compliance because it had no reason to believe that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident. Unfortunately, that is not enough to meet the standard of a high degree of diligence. I therefore find that the Minister was justified in assessing the penalty pursuant to section 227(8) of the Act.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[44] Based on the above analysis, I find that subsection 215(6) is devoid of any requirement that the payer have knowledge that the payee is a non-resident. The provision clearly states that where a person has failed to deduct and remit as required, they are liable for Part XIII tax. Having concluded that Sebastiana Trimarchi was a non-resident during the relevant years, and the evidence having shown that the Appellant has failed to withhold and remit the 25% tax payable on the rent paid to her, the Appellant is liable for Part XIII tax. Further, the Appellant is liable for penalties and interest as provided for by subsections 227(8) and (8.3).\n[45] My examination of the scheme provided for in Part XIII of the Act leads me to conclude that it contains an integrated set of provisions designed to tax non-residents on income such as rents and to ensure collection of taxes due. As argued by the Appellant, Part XIII may have harsh consequences, and in some instances, even more so than in others. However, in light of the purpose of the scheme, I am persuaded that subsection 215(6) is meant to apply in a way that imposes liability on the resident payer, such as the Appellant, who has failed to withhold and remit.\n[46] The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of March 2023.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 37\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2021-1804(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n3792391 CANADA INC.

OVERVIEW\n[1] Ms. Wan appeals to this Court from reassessments made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under the Income Tax Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)) (the \u201cAct\u201d) disallowing the deduction of a portion of her advertising and promotion expenses (the \u201cAdvertising Expenses\u201d), the disallowed portion being $59,800 in 2016 and $58,000 in 2017, in computing her employment income. I will refer to the 2016 and 2017 taxation years as the \u201cTaxation Years\u201d.\n[2] The Minister is of the view that the Advertising Expenses were not made or incurred by Ms. Wan, or alternatively, if they were made or incurred, they were not made or incurred for the purpose of earning employment income, and thus, they were not deductible in computing her employment income. The Minister allowed other advertising and promotion expenses totalling $32,493 in 2016 and $17,602 in 2017.\n[3] During the Taxation Years, Ms. Wan was employed as a family service advisor for Service Corporation International (Canada). Her employment duties included making cemetery arrangements for client families, selling pre-need arrangements for cemeteries and funeral homes, networking and building relationships to generate referrals, and establishing and maintaining strong business relationships with client families. Ms. Wan was successful during the Taxation Years, earning employment income, together with commissions, totalling $400,333 ($355,905 of which was from commissions) in 2016 and $446,845 ($412,887 of which was from commissions) in 2017.\n[4] The Advertising Expenses relate to services allegedly provided to Ms. Wan by corporations wholly owned by her spouse and daughter. In 2016, Ms. Wan claimed a deduction for advertising and promotion expenses totalling $29,900 for services rendered by a corporation owned by her spouse and $29,900 for services rendered by a corporation owned by her daughter. In 2017, Ms. Wan claimed a deduction for advertising and promotion expenses totalling $29,000 for services rendered by another corporation owned by her spouse and $29,000 for services rendered by another corporation owned by her daughter.\n[5] At the hearing, the only person who testified was Ms. Wan.\nII. THE ISSUE AND THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT\n[6] The issue is whether the Advertising Expenses are deductible under paragraph 8(1)(f) of the Act in computing Ms. Wan\u2019s employment income.\n[7] The relevant provisions of the Act read as follows:\n8(1) In computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment, there may be deducted such of the following amounts as are wholly applicable to that source or such part of the following amounts as may reasonably be regarded as applicable thereto\n\u2026\n(f) where the taxpayer was employed in the year in connection with the selling of property or negotiating of contracts for the taxpayer\u2019s employer, and\n(i) under the contract of employment was required to pay the taxpayer\u2019s own expenses,\n(ii) was ordinarily required to carry on the duties of the employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business,\n(iii) was remunerated in whole or part by commissions or other similar amounts fixed by reference to the volume of the sales made or the contracts negotiated, and\n(iv) was not in receipt of an allowance for travel expenses in respect of the taxation year that was, by virtue of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(v), not included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income,\namounts expended by the taxpayer in the year for the purpose of earning the income from the employment (not exceeding the commissions or other similar amounts referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(f)(iii) and received by the taxpayer in the year) to the extent that those amounts were not\n(v) outlays, losses or replacements of capital or payments on account of capital, except as described in paragraph 8(1)(j),\n(vi) outlays or expenses that would, by virtue of paragraph 18(1)(l), not be deductible in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year if the employment were a business carried on by the taxpayer, or\n(vii) amounts the payment of which reduced the amount that would otherwise be included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year because of paragraph 6(1)(e);\n\u2026\n8(2) Except as permitted by this section, no deductions shall be made in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment.\n\u2026\n8(10) An amount otherwise deductible for a taxation year under paragraph (1)(c), (f), (h) or (h.1) or subparagraph (1)(i)(ii) or (iii) by a taxpayer shall not be deducted unless a prescribed form, signed by the taxpayer\u2019s employer certifying that the conditions set out in the applicable provision were met in the year in respect of the taxpayer, is filed with the taxpayer\u2019s return of income for the year.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[8] At the hearing, the Respondent confirmed that the requirements found in subparagraphs 8(1)(f)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the Act were met and were not at issue in these appeals. The Respondent also confirmed that Ms. Wan had filed the prescribed T2200 forms referred to in subsection 8(10) of the Act for the Taxation Years and that this was not at issue in these appeals.\nIII. CONCLUSION\n[9] For the following reasons, the appeal from the reassessments made by the Minister under the Act for the Taxation Years is dismissed, without costs.\nIV. POSITION OF THE PARTIES\n(i) Ms. Wan\n[10] According to Ms. Wan, the Advertising Expenses were made for the purpose of earning employment income and should be deductible in computing her employment income. Specifically, she argues that she was more successful during the Taxation Years given the services rendered by her husband\u2019s and her daughter\u2019s corporations, and thus, the expenses were reasonable.\n(ii) The Respondent\n[11] The Respondent is of the view that Ms. Wan did not make or incur the Advertising Expenses. Ms. Wan did not show, on a balance of probabilities, that she incurred the Advertising Expenses.\n[12] The oral evidence adduced at the hearing is not sufficient to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumptions. Ms. Wan\u2019s testimony was vague and unreliable and she failed to meet the prima facie case to show that the Advertising Expenses were expended.\n[13] Ms. Wan was required to retain books and records as per subsection 230(1) of the Act. The receipts adduced into evidence did not show a description of the services rendered or a method of payment like receipts ordinarily do in commercial transactions. No other supporting documentation such as time logs, bank statements, cheques, journal ledgers, records of calls made, or details of services rendered, was adduced at the hearing to corroborate the claim for the deduction of the Advertising Expenses.\n[14] In the alternative, even if the Court finds that the Advertising Expenses were expended, they were not expended for the purpose of earning employment income.\n[15] Furthermore, the Respondent asks the Court to draw an adverse inference from Ms. Wan\u2019s failure to call her spouse and daughter to testify at the hearing. Specifically, an inference should be drawn that their testimony would have shown that the Advertising Expenses were not expended by Ms. Wan or that the Advertising Expenses were not expended for the purpose of earning employment income (Chaplin v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 194, at para. 51).\nV. ANALYSIS\n[16] As explained by Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 in Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 336, at paras. 92\u201395, generally, in tax appeals, the burden of proof rests on the appellant. The appellant bears the burden of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions of facts and proving on a balance of probabilities the facts justifying his or her position.\n[17] According to paragraph 8(1)(f) of the Act, subject to conditions not at issue in these appeals, \u201c\u2026 amounts expended by the taxpayer in the year for the purpose of earning the income from the employment \u2026\u201d are deductible in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income from an employment. Thus, Ms. Wan had to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Advertising Expenses were expended by her and that they were expended to earn employment income.\n[18] For the following reasons, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, Ms. Wan did not show that the Advertising Expenses were expended by her. Her testimony was neither convincing nor credible. Ms. Wan should have adduced detailed and cogent testimony and supporting evidence, where possible, to show that the Advertising Expenses were expended by her. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that she did not do so.\n[19] Furthermore, the absence of Ms. Wan\u2019s daughter and husband from the hearing leads me to draw an adverse inference, that is, that their respective testimony would have shown that she did not pay their corporations for the alleged marketing and promotion services.\n[20] Ms. Wan testified that she joined Service Corporation International (Canada) in 2007. The essence of her work is to expand her relations and be in contact with many people. Therefore, she used different methods for marketing and advertising her services. Not only did she use newspaper ads, charity galas and radio advertising, Ms. Wan testified that she also used the services of her spouse and daughter. As death is a sensitive issue, few people are receptive to discussing it. Ms. Wan testified that in 2015, she started to reach out to more organizations and groups and to attend more functions in order to attract clients. She also decided to contact previous clients to determine whether they wanted to revisit some issues. She noticed an increase in her sales as a result of an increase in her marketing and advertising expenses.\n[21] Statements of accounts for the periods ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 from her spouse\u2019s and daughter\u2019s corporations (exhibits A-1 to A-4) as well as receipts issued by the said corporations to Ms. Wan (exhibits R\u201111, R-12, R-13 and R-15) were entered into evidence. Ms. Wan explained that her daughter provided marketing services to her, which consisted in organizing events during various festivals and organizing various campaigns hosted by Ms. Wan. As for her husband, Ms. Wan testified that he made various cold calls to prospective clients in an attempt to increase her sales.\n[22] However, Ms. Wan did not adduce any cheques or bank statements or any other supporting documents showing that the Advertising Expenses were paid by her. Moreover, Ms. Wan did not adduce evidence of invoices from these corporations or other supporting documentation such as scripts for the cold calls, a list of calls made, time logs, or a description of services rendered. Ms. Wan testified that as she was confident that her daughter and her spouse rendered the services that she paid for, so she did not need to request other supporting documentation. She also did not execute any formal service agreements with the corporations.\n[23] Ms. Wan testified that she had paid the Advertising Expenses to her daughter\u2019s and spouse\u2019s corporations. However, as indicated above, no supporting documentation except for the receipts and statements of accounts were provided to the Court. I have not given any weight to this part of Ms. Wan\u2019s testimony as it is self-serving.\n[24] As stated by this Court in DiCosmo v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 325 (affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in 2017 FCA 60):\n[29] \u2026 The deduction of employment expenses by taxpayers should generally be supported by contemporaneous documentation so that the Court can be satisfied that the deductions are proper. In this case, Mr. DiCosmo needed to provide sufficient evidence to support the deductions claimed \u2026 . I find Mr. DiCosmo\u2019s testimony to be completely unsatisfactory in this regard.\n[25] Furthermore, according to subsection 230(1) of the Act, Ms. Wan must maintain and have detailed information and documentation in support of her claim that the Advertising Expenses were expended by her and were expended for the purpose of earning employment income:\n230 (1) Every person carrying on business and every person who is required, by or pursuant to this Act, to pay or collect taxes or other amounts shall keep records and books of account (including an annual inventory kept in prescribed manner) at the person\u2019s place of business or residence in Canada or at such other place as may be designated by the Minister, in such form and containing such information as will enable the taxes payable under this Act or the taxes or other amounts that should have been deducted, withheld or collected to be determined.\n[26] As indicated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Njenga v. The Queen, 96 DTC 6593, at 6594:\nThe Income tax system is based on self monitoring. As a public policy matter the burden of proof of deductions and claims properly rests with the taxpayer. The Tax Court Judge held that persons such as the Appellant must maintain and have available detailed information and documentation in support of the claims they make. We agree with that finding. Ms. Njenga as the Taxpayer is responsible for documenting her own personal affairs in a reasonable manner. Self written receipts and assertion without proof are not sufficient.\n[27] However, I want to point out that there is no requirement that vouchers or receipts be provided for all expenditures claimed as deductions provided that the expenditures are proved by other credible evidence (see McMillan v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 393; Chrabalowski v. The Queen, 2004 TCC 644).\n[28] There is no need for a taxpayer to introduce every single receipt, but the taxpayer would have had to first prove, by some other credible means, that the expenditures were incurred and that the expenditures were incurred for the purpose of earning employment income. Ms. Wan failed in that respect.\n[29] Ms. Wan is a successful salesperson: she advertises regularly in local newspapers, on the radio, as well as at charity events. She usually keeps detailed documentation for supporting the deduction of her advertising expenses. In respect of the Advertising Expenses, she did not keep any documents showing that the amounts were expended except for the receipts and statements of accounts. I find this evidence unsatisfactory to support the claim for the deduction of the Advertising Expenses.\n[30] When assessing the credibility of a witness, I can consider inconsistencies, the attitude and demeanour of the witness, motives the witness may have to fabricate evidence, and the \u201coverall sense of the evidence\u201d. As stated by Justice Valerie Miller in Nichols v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 334, 2009 DTC 1203, at paragraph 23:\n[23] In assessing credibility I can consider inconsistencies or weaknesses in the evidence of witnesses, including internal inconsistencies (that is, whether the testimony changed while on the stand or from that given at discovery), prior inconsistent statements, and external inconsistencies (that is, whether the evidence of the witness is inconsistent with independent evidence which has been accepted by me). Second, I can assess the attitude and demeanour of the witness. Third, I can assess whether the witness has a motive to fabricate evidence or to mislead the court. Finally, I can consider the overall sense of the evidence. That is, when common sense is applied to the testimony, does it suggest that the evidence is impossible or highly improbable.\n[31] Here, the credibility and the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at the hearing is determinative (Landry v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 399, 2009 DTC 1359, at para. 47; Roy v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 226, 2008 DTC 3224). I have also considered the overall reasonableness of the reassessments in my determination of whether to allow these appeals.\n[32] I did consider these principles in assessing the evidence adduced at the hearing of these appeals and, for the foregoing reasons, I find that no credible evidence was adduced at the hearing to support Ms. Wan\u2019s position. Furthermore, the evidence showed that during the Taxation Years, Ms. Wan\u2019s daughter was a full\u2011time student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor of Arts. I find that it is not credible that Ms. Wan\u2019s daughter would have rendered the alleged services to Ms. Wan given that she was pursuing a Bachelor of Arts at the same time.\n[33] Finally, an adverse inference can be drawn from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness, especially if the witness\u2019s evidence would have been central to establishing an important fact (Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 FCA 79, at para. 14).\n[34] In the case at bar, the testimony of Ms. Wan\u2019s spouse and daughter was central to establishing the fact that their corporations did receive the amounts at issue. However, I did not receive any credible explanations justifying their absence at the hearing. I find that I should draw an adverse inference from their failure to appear and that their testimony would have shown that the Advertising Expenses were not expended by Ms. Wan.\nSigned at Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, this 3rd day of April 2023.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 38\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2021-1331(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nANNA WAI MAN WAN v.

FACTS\n[1] A-Supreme Nursing & Home Care Services Inc. (the Appellant) places nurses in long-term care facilities and nursing homes (the \u201cClients\u201d). These arrangements are made by way of contracts entered into between the Appellant and various Clients. The Appellant did not collect GST\/HST from their Clients for providing Registered Nurses (RN) and Registered Practical Nurses (RPN) because the Appellant believed it was providing nursing services to its Clients, and therefore the supply was exempt.\n[2] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) reassessed the Appellant on the basis that the Appellant made a taxable supply to the Clients. Specifically, the supply provided was a placement service of RNs and RPNs and therefore the Appellant should have collected GST\/HST on the revenue it received. In order to determine whether the Appellant should have collected GST\/HST, I must determine whether the supply provided by the Appellant was the exempt supply of nursing services or in the alternative was a taxable supply.\nA. Issue:\n[3] The Appeal deals with whether the supplies of personnel and nursing by the Appellant to the Clients during the Reporting Periods was a taxable supply subject to GST, or an exempt supply of nursing services as contemplated under section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act RSC 1985, c. E-15.(the \u201cAct\u201d).\nB. Background:\n[4] The Appellant is incorporated under the Business Corporations Act of Ontario, with its head office located in Toronto, Ontario. All of the Appellant\u2019s business was conducted in Ontario.\n[5] The Appellant\u2019s Clients are nursing homes and long-term care facilities. It is these relationships that are before the Court. The Appellant entered into services agreements (the \u201cServices Agreements\u201d) with its Clients. These Service Agreements were for the most part the same for all Clients[1].\n[6] The personnel that the Appellant placed with the Clients were RNs, RPNs and personal support workers (PSWs). These personnel were both employees of the Appellant and in some cases independent contractors.\n[7] The personnel in question had individual contracts with the Appellant. They did not contract with the Clients. The Client paid the Appellant directly. The Appellant then paid the personnel.\n[8] One of the terms of the Service Agreement between the Appellant and the Clients was as follows:\nA-Supreme shall provide staff (Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses and Personal Support Workers) to perform nursing duties as long term home may require. Registered staff will have a current and valid license in good standing with the College of Nurses of Ontario or certificate and\/or diploma where necessary. All of our caregivers are bonded and insured and covered by Professional Liability Insurance and with Workers Safety and insurance Board.\n[9] Pursuant to the Service Agreements:\nthe Appellant provides RNs, RPNs and PSWs to the Clients on an as-needed basis;\nthe Appellant did not collect GST on the fees charges to the Clients;\nthe Clients decided the shifts, days and hours for which they needed RNs, RPNs and PSWs from the Appellant;\nthe Appellant paid the RNs, RPNs and PSWs for the work they performed in the Client\u2019s facilities;\nthe Clients did not pay the RNs, RPNs and PSWs; and\nan employee of the Appellant was not to be hired by the Client until the employee completed 500 hours of service. After this point, the Client could hire the individual.\n[10] Pursuant to the offer of employment between the RNs, RPNs and PSWs and the Appellant, the Appellant is described as an employment agency.\n[11] As part of its business, the Appellant also provides nursing care to individuals in their private homes, on a one to one basis. The Minister does not question that this was an exempt supply of nursing services.\n[12] At the outset of trial, the parties jointly took the position that this was a case of a single supply by the Appellant to various Clients. I agree that the supply in issue is a single compound supply.\nII. WITNESSES\n[13] Four witnesses testified at trial, all on behalf of the Appellant. They were as follows:\na.Shawna Flynn, who was the managing director of the Appellant;\nb.Rhonda Soames, the marketing director of the Appellant, who was responsible for the daily operations of the Appellant, and ensured that the personnel acted according to the standards set by the company;\nc.Sandra Knight, who both ran a separate care facility and was also an RPN working for the Appellant;\nd.Novelette Robinson, a Registered Nurse with the Appellant.\n[14] The witnesses\u2019 testimony will be explored in more detail in the analysis section of the decision. In summary, the witnesses described the work they did for the Appellant, as well as the work the Appellant provided to Clients. Each of the witnesses was helpful, forthright and assisted in making the facts of this case clear.\n[15] A Partial Agreed Statement of Facts was also entered into evidence at trial.\nIII. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nA. Position of the Appellant\n[16] The Appellant submits that the services provided to the Clients by the Appellant, through the RNs and the RPNs were an exempt supply of nursing services pursuant to section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act.\n[17] The Appellant further submits that upon a review of the facts of this case, several factors support the conclusion that nursing services were provided by the Appellant[2]. Therefore, the predominant element of the single supply provided by the Appellant was nursing services.\n[18] The Appellant also submits that the Minister incorrectly draws a distinction between the services they provide to private individuals and the services provided to the Clients. Specifically the Appellant argues that these services are analogous and thus should both be exempt.\nB. Position of the Respondent\n[19] The Respondent submits that the Appellant provided the Clients a taxable supply of nursing personnel and was required to collect GST\/HST in respect of those supplies.\n[20] Specifically the Respondent submits that the Appellant\u2019s services to the Clients are not exempt under section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act, as the supplies provided by the Appellant to the Clients were not a supply of a nursing service but rather, a supply of personnel. This is a supply of property, not a service. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the supplies provided by the Appellant were not rendered to an individual (with respect to the definition of nursing services found at Section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act) but rather, the supplies the Appellant made was to the Clients. Therefore, the supplies were not rendered within a \u201cnurse-patient relationship\u201d.\nIV. LAW\n[21] As correctly set out in the Respondent\u2019s submissions, subsection 221(1) of the Act provides that every person who makes a taxable supply shall collect the GST\/HST payable by the recipient in respect of the supply. Subsection 225(1) provides that all amounts that became collectible or were collected in the particular reporting period are to be taken into account in calculating the amount of net tax to be remitted to the Receiver General in accordance with subsection 228(2) of the Act.\n[22] GST\/HST is collectible in respect of a \u201ctaxable supply\u201d, which is defined at s. 123(1) of the Act as \u201ca supply that is made in course of commercial activity\u201d. A \u201ccommercial activity\u201d is defined as s.123 as including \u201ca business carried on by the person [\u2026] except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person\u201d. An \u201cexempt supply\u201d is defined in s.123(1) as \u201ca supply included in Schedule V\u201d.\n[23] Section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act provides that a nursing service is an exempt supply, where the supply is:\n[Nursing service] A supply of a nursing service rendered to an individual by a registered nurse, a registered nursing assistant, a licensed or registered practical nurse or a registered psychiatric nurse, if the service is rendered within a nurse-patient relationship.\n[24] In the matter before the Court, the only contract that must be interpreted is the contract between the Appellant and the Clients. The Clients clearly meet the definition of recipient as set out in the Act. The question becomes, does the supply provided by the Appellant meet the definition of nursing services as defined under Section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act.\n[25] I note that in reviewing the description of nursing service set out above, the legislation uses the phrase \u201cnursing service rendered to an individual\u201d. It does not require that the recipient (in this case the Client) of the supply must be the party to whom the nursing services were rendered[3].\n[26] The intent of section 6 of Part II of Schedule V is clearly to exempt the provision of nursing services in general[4].This is demonstrated by the explanatory notes justifying the amendment of the wording of section 6 announced in the 2008 Federal Budget:\nNursing has evolved since the inception of the GST and nurses are increasingly providing their services outside of institutional and residential settings. This has resulted in certain anomalies. For example, a vaccination performed by a registered nurse in a hospital or medical clinic is exempt, whereas the same service performed in the office of a registered nurse in private practice is subject to GST\/HST.\nBudget 2008 proposes to exempt from GST\/HST nursing services rendered to an individual by a registered nurse, a registered nursing assistant, a licensed or registered practical nurse or a registered psychiatric nurse if the service is provided within a nurse-patient relationship, regardless of where the service is performed.\n[27] Therefore I must determine if the supply the Clients purchased has the following characteristics:\na \u201cservice\u201d per section 123(1) (i.e. not a supply of property);\nthe service is a \u201cnursing service\u201d;\nthe service is \u201crendered\u201d to an \u201cindividual\u201d;\nthe service is \u201crendered within a nurse patient relationship\u201d; and\nthe supply has a health care purpose.\nV. Jurisprudence on Nursing Services\n[28] My analysis on this matter must start with the H\u00f4pital Santa Cabrini v Canada[5], (\u201cHSC\u201d) a Tax Court of Canada decision, which was later upheld in the Federal Court of Appeal. In the 2015 HSC decision, the Tax Court of Canada (the \u201cTCC\u201d), held that the supply of nurses by a staffing agency, to a hospital, was a taxable supply of nursing personnel and not an exempt supply of nursing services. Specifically, after analyzing the legal relationships between the agencies and the hospital the TCC concluded that the agencies had the right to control and manage the work of nurses,[6] and were simply leasing this right rather than supplying nursing services:\n[44] Here, in my opinion, the object of the prestation is the right conferred on the H\u00f4pital by the Agencies to require their employees to carry out work for a period of time to which is added as an accessory the delegation of the right of direction and control over the work, a right held by the Agencies with respect to the work performed by their employees under their contracts of employment. The Agencies\u2019 employees are in some way loaned or leased to the H\u00f4pital. That is what happens when the Agencies assign their employees to the H\u00f4pital: these employees become subject to the H\u00f4pital\u2019s rights to require them to perform their work and to exercise direction and control over said work.[7]\n[29] Furthermore, the Court held that the legal relationship between the agencies and the hospital was not a contract of enterprise or services (which in the Court\u2019s mind would constitute providing nursing services). Specifically the Court reasoned that:\n(1)an analogy to a subcontractor (where all that matters is the end product) could not be drawn as the hospital had direction and control over the performance of the nurses\u2019 work;[8]\n(2)based on the Act Respecting Health Services and Social Services it would not be appropriate for the hospital to subcontract any of its health care services;[9]\n(3)the nurses had to integrate into various teams providing various services which necessarily required the direction and control of the hospitals;[10] and\n(4)the agencies\u2019 mission are not to provide health care services;[11] rather than providing healthcare services, they leased the right of direction and control over the nurses\u2019 work.[12]\n[30] Further, the Court held that there are several necessary conditions for a supply to be classified as an exempt nursing service under section 6, notably:[13]\nthere is a \u201cservice\u201d per section 123(1) (i.e. not a supply of property);\nthe service is a \u201cnursing service\u201d;\nthe service is \u201crendered\u201d to an \u201cindividual\u201d;\nthe service is \u201crendered with a nurse patient relationship\u201d; and\nthe supply has a health care purpose.\n[31] Ultimately, the TCC concluded that leasing the right to manage and control the work of nurses was not an exempt supply of nursing services, as it was a supply of property.[14] In the alternative, the Court concluded that even if such a lease constituted a service, the supply provided was a lease of nursing personnel rather than a nursing service. Specifically, the supply could not have been nursing services, as the agencies rendered no health care services.[15]\n[32] The Federal Court of Appeal (the \u201cFCA\u201d) upheld the TCC\u2019s decision. In their analysis the FCA held that it must be determined if the agencies provide health care services to the hospital.[16] Thus, \u201cthe nature of the services provided by the agencies to the hospital\u201d was determinative of whether there was an exempt nursing services supply.[17] In other words, the FCA set out to determine if the nature of the supply was personnel services or nursing services.\n[33] The FCA held that the facts of the case were sufficient to find that the agencies provided a \u201cplacement services system\u201d as opposed to health care services.[18] Specifically, the FCA found that the hospital, not the agencies, maintained management and control over the provision of health care services; and thus the agencies simply supplied the nursing personnel not the nursing services:\n[21] [\u2026] The evidence submitted before the Judge and the testimony heard reveal the following:\nThere is no agreement between the H\u00f4pital and the nurses placed by the Agencies;\nThe H\u00f4pital agreed not to recruit a nurse placed by an Agency that it has employed in the previous twelve (12) months;\nThe only object of the agreement between the H\u00f4pital and the Agencies is the supply of nursing staff;\nThe Agencies' function is not to provide health care services but rather to place nurses;\nThe H\u00f4pital is responsible for the delivery of health care services and the management and control of nurses;\nThe Agencies have no control over the work of nurses placed at the H\u00f4pital.\n[\u2026]\n[22] In addition, the Judge correctly took the Act Respecting Health Services and Social Services, CQLR c S-4.2, into consideration. That provincial act could not be any clearer: hospitals are responsible for carrying out the duties related to health care services. Common sense dictates that a hospital cannot delegate control of health care services to a placement agency, whether it be in its emergency room or for intensive care.\n[\u2026]\n[23] Several indicia also emphasize the fact that the H\u00f4pital is responsible for the management and control over nurses from the Agencies, which confirms that it is the H\u00f4pital\u2014not the Agencies\u2014that provides the health care services. In particular, I note: (i) that no representative of the Agencies is on site when the nurses are working at the H\u00f4pital; (ii) that the Agencies have no access to patients' files at the H\u00f4pital; (iii) that the nurses do not hold themselves out to patients as nurses from an agency, even though they wear the agency's identity card; and (iv) that the H\u00f4pital remains the entity responsible for providing the care in question. I also note that the H\u00f4pital is not contesting that the nurses placed there by the Agencies are under its control and management.\n[24] In the light of the above, it was open to the Judge to conclude that the object of the agreements between the H\u00f4pital and the Agencies is the supply of nurses by the Agencies, that the H\u00f4pital is responsible for the provision of health care services by nurses from the Agencies and that the nurses from the Agencies are under the H\u00f4pital's control and management. In short, the Agencies provide a placement services system, meet a need for nursing services for the H\u00f4pital and do not provide health care services, while the exemption in section 6 of Part II of Schedule V of the Act is explicitly limited to the supply of care. That, in itself, is sufficient to dismiss the appeal.[19]\n[34] It is crucial to parse exactly what legal holdings the FCA made in HSC in order to apply these binding holdings to the present case. In deciding the matter, the FCA emphasized two factors, to support the conclusion that the hospital maintained responsibility for the provision of health care services. First, the Court found that provincial statute assigned responsibility of health care service to the hospital and prevented them from delegating this responsibility. Second, the Court found that the hospital maintained management and control over the nurses, which meant the hospital was responsible for the provision of health care services.\n[35] The FCA\u2019s emphasis on these factors should only be read to the extent that they inform the distinction between supplying personnel rather than supplying nursing services. That is, not having responsibility over health-care services tips the scale towards classifying a supply as a personnel service rather than a nursing service.\n[36] However, it is my conclusion that the FCA\u2019s decision should not be read to suggest that having general responsibility over the provision of health care services is a necessary condition to providing an exempt nursing services supply. Specifically, this interpretation, which is consistent with the position of the Respondent[20] would be inconsistent with the idea that a sole-practitioner nurse could contract with a hospital to provide exempt nursing services on an as-needed basis. That is, in this example, the sole-practitioner nurse would not have responsibility, control or management over the general provision of health care services provided by the hospital yet there is no doubt they would be providing an exempt supply of nursing services. Finding otherwise would lead one to conclude that any service provided by a contractor is a supply of personnel rather than the service actually provided for.\n[37] The FCA\u2019s conclusion in HSC requires significant consideration in my final decision due to its binding nature and the case\u2019s somewhat analogous factual circumstances. Specifically, in HSC, the FCA determined the nature of the supply in question by looking at the facts of the case. Thus, in analyzing the present appeal it is appropriate to consider both the similarities and distinctions to HSC.\nVI. Distinctions between the Present Appeal and HSC\nDistinction in Management and Control over Nurses\n[38] The degree of management and control by the Clients over the Appellant\u2019s nurses is distinct from the degree of management and control by the hospital over the agencies\u2019 nurses in HSC.\n[39] The TCC in HSC found that:\n[I]t is essential that the worker placed by the Agencies integrate into the team of various services or care units within which the worker works and this provision of services necessarily requires the H\u00f4pital to exercise a right of direction and control over his or her work.[21]\n[40] In contrast, the evidence given at trial in this matter indicated that the Appellant\u2019s nurses required no supervision in conducting their work.[22] Further, the Appellant\u2019s nurses were regularly[23] responsible for the Client\u2019s facilities (or the \u201ccharge nurse\u201d).[24] In addition, if nurses had issues related to their work, they would report them to the Appellant not the Clients;[25] for example, if a nurse needed to leave a facility they would contact the Appellant, who then would be responsible for making alternative arrangements.[26]\n[41] Furthermore, Ms. Robinson specifically testified that hospitals exercise larger amounts of management and control over nurses than care-homes:\nMR. De BARTOLO:\nWhat is the difference, if any, in regards to the direction and control of your nursing duties at a hospital, such as Etobicoke General, as opposed to the direction and control of your nursing duties at a care home?\nMS. ROBINSON: Okay, so at the care home, I\u2019m in charge of residents as well as the building. So I\u2019m in charge of the entire building, meaning I\u2019m the boss when I\u2019m there at night. I'm the fire chief, everything. I\u2019m the everything at the long-term care.\nWhen I\u2019m at Etobicoke, I have a nurse manager that can facilitate other emergency, while at the long-term care, I\u2019m the one who facilitate and direct any emergency events that happen.[27]\n[\u2026]\nMR. De BARTOLO: Okay, at Etobicoke General, who directs and controls what you do in terms of performing your nursing services?\nMS. ROBINSON: Well, no one really directs us. Once we\u2019re there, we\u2019re doing our job. So everyone knows what job to do when they walk into -- when they come on duty, basically. But what I\u2019m allowed to do in a long-term -- as an agency nurse, I\u2019m an agency nurse, I go to a facility and I\u2019m in charge. That would never happen at Etobicoke. I\u2019m a staff there but I---\nMR. De BARTOLO: What would never happen? I\u2019m sorry.\nMS. ROBINSON: They would never have an agency staff be in charge at Etobicoke. I also do charge nurse at Etobicoke at times, so I know that position would never be filled by agency staff, never.\nMR. De BARTOLO: So when you mean by \u201cagency staff\u201d, is it because they want someone regular and full-time there?\nMS. ROBINSON: Yeah, they have to have their own staff. They have to have their own staff in the hospital. In a long-term care, they hire us, agency staff, to be charge.\nMR. De BARTOLO: And who supervises your nursing duties at a hospital?\nMS. ROBINSON: I would say our charge nurse, our manager -- nurse manager. Supervising, it\u2019s -- no one is watching over us as we do our jobs.\nMR. De BARTOLO: Okay.\nMS. ROBINSON: But if anything arise that beyond our capability, then we would refer to the nurse manager.[28]\n[42] The fact that the Appellant\u2019s nurses were regularly the single charge nurse responsible for running the Client\u2019s facilities demonstrates that the Appellant\u2019s nurses had greater management and control over their work when compared to the nurses in HSC. Furthermore, in HSC the TCC specifically noted that the services provided by the nurses \u201ccannot be defined beforehand because the services are too varied.\u201d[29] In the present appeal no evidence suggests there was great variation in the work needed or that the Clients\u2019 facilities had several units. Rather the evidence showed that every floor of the Clients\u2019 care homes consisted of residents that needed similar one-on-one treatment, such as administering medication.[30] These facts weigh in favor of classifying the Appellant\u2019s supply as nursing services rather than the supply of nursing personnel.\nDistinction in Governing Statute\n[43] The provincial statutes that govern the Clients versus the hospital in HSC are distinct.[31] In HSC, both the TCC and FCA found the Act Respecting Health Services and Social Services to be relevant. However, in Ontario, the relevant statute to consider, as best that I can determine, is the Long-Term Care Homes Act.[32]\n[44] Similar to the Act Respecting Health Services and Social Services, the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007 clearly puts the general responsibility of health care services on the operators of care homes. For example, subsections 6(1), (3) and (8) set out that care home operators must have a written plan for residents that covers all aspect of care (including nursing); also, operators must ensure that all people providing direct care (e.g. both employees and agency nurses) are kept informed of this plan. Furthermore, subsections 8(1), and (3) obligate operators of care homes to ensure there are nursing services available to meet resident\u2019s needs, and that a nurse is present in the home 24 hours a day (the \u201c24 Hour Rule\u201d).\n[45] In HSC, the FCA noted that hospitals could not delegate control over health care services to the agencies. However, subject to certain conditions, the regulation[33] to the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007, allows operators to fulfill the 24 Hour Rule by using agency nurses:\n24-hour nursing care \u2014 exceptions\n45. (1) The following are the exceptions to the requirement that at least one registered nurse who is both an employee of the licensee and a member of the regular nursing staff of the home is on duty and present in the home at all times, as required under subsection 8 (3) of the Act:\n1. For homes with a licensed bed capacity of 64 beds or fewer,\ni. [\u2026]\nii. in the case of an emergency where the back-up plan referred to in clause 31 (3) (d) of this Regulation fails to ensure that the requirement under subsection 8 (3) of the Act is met,\nA. a registered nurse who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement between the licensee and an employment agency or other third party may be used if the Director of Nursing and Personal Care or a registered nurse who is both an employee of the licensee and a member of the regular nursing staff is available by telephone, or\nB. [\u2026]\n2. For homes with a licensed bed capacity of more than 64 beds and fewer than 129 beds,\ni. [\u2026]\nii. in the case of an emergency where the back-up plan referred to in clause 31 (3) (d) of this Regulation fails to ensure that the requirement under subsection 8 (3) of the Act is met, a registered nurse who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement between the licensee and an employment agency or other third party may be used if,\nA. the Director of Nursing and Personal Care or a registered nurse who is both an employee of the licensee and a member of the regular nursing staff is available by telephone, and\nB. a registered practical nurse who is both an employee of the licensee and a member of the regular nursing staff is on duty and present in the home.\n3. For all homes, in the case of a pandemic that prevents a registered nurse from getting to the home, and where the back-up plan referred to in clause 31 (3) (d) of this Regulation fails to ensure that the requirement under subsection 8 (3) of the Act is met,\ni. a registered nurse who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement with the licensee or who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement between the licensee and an employment agency or other third party may be used,\nii. a registered practical nurse who is an employee of the licensee or who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement with the licensee or who works at the home pursuant to a contract or agreement between the licensee and an employment agency or other third party may be used if the Director of Nursing and Personal Care or a registered nurse is available for consultation, or\niii. [\u2026][34]\n[46] In any case, as discussed in paragraph 36 above, I do not believe the FCA in HSC intended to make the general responsibility over the provision of health care services a necessary condition to providing nursing services. Thus, as previously written, it is my conclusion that the fact that the Clients delegated significant responsibility to the Appellant\u2019s nurses on a regular basis[35] suggests that they were supplying nursing services.\nThe Appellant was Responsible for Insurance, Orientation and Re-Training\n[47] In the course of providing services, the Appellant maintained several other responsibilities that are indicative of nursing services.\n[48] Per the Services Agreements, the Appellant was obliged to maintain general liability insurance for its nurses. Such an obligation shifts some of the responsibility of providing nursing services onto the Appellant (i.e. via risk mitigation). In contrast, no such provision existed in the services agreement between the agencies and HSC.\n[49] The Appellant was also responsible for orientating the nurses on both their own code of conduct and the Client\u2019s polices. Such orientation is consistent with the provision of nursing services as it informs the nurses how to perform their nursing duties.\n[50] Furthermore, the Appellant was also responsible for re-educating nurses when the Clients took issue with the nursing service provided.[36] Similar to orientating the nurses, the responsibility to re-educate the nurses in how to fulfill their nursing duties is consistent with the provision of nursing services.\nThe Appellant is also in the Business of Providing Exempt Nursing Services\n[51] The Appellant also provided exempt nursing services to individuals in their private homes; however, there was no suggestion of this being the case for the agencies in HSC. At trial, the Respondent argued that the exempt nursing services the Appellant provides to private individuals is not relevant as it is not in issue (i.e. CRA already agreed such services were exempt).[37] However, I have concluded that I may consider this as a relevant fact as it, in small part, helps to distinguish the present appeal from HSC. Moreover, it helps demonstrate that the Appellant was capable of providing exempt nursing services on their own which helps inform the characterization of the services being provided to the Clients.\nOther miscellaneous factors\n[52] Although not necessarily a distinct factor from HSC, one other fact that came out at trial, which supports the contention that nursing services were being provided by the Appellant, is the fact that the RNs and RPNs wore identification badges at the facilities which identified them as nurses.\nVII. Similarities between the Present Appeal and HSC\n[53] In HSC the Court outlined various indicia which helped determine that the hospital and not the agencies were responsible for the management and control of the nurses; several of these indicia are present in this case. Specifically:\nthere is no representative of the Appellant on site when the nurses are working;\nthere is no agreement between the Clients and the nurses;\nthe Clients agree to limits on their ability to hire away the Appellants staff;\nthe Appellant does not have access to the care home patients files; and\nthe nurses do not hold themselves out as nurses of the Clients at their job.\nVIII. Other Relevant Case Law Principles\n[54] The evidence led at trial showed that the Appellant\u2019s supply had characteristics of both a supply of nursing services and a supply of personnel. This is therefore a situation where there is both an exempt supply (nursing services) mixed with a supply that is taxable (supply of personnel).\n[55] In the recent River Cree Resort Limited Partnership and Her Majesty the Queen 2022 TCC 45, Justice Graham reviewed the case law and method to apply to determine what the nature of the supply is in a situation such as this:\n[103]The courts have set out tests to use in these circumstances to determine the nature of the supplies. The following is an attempt to assimilate those tests into a comprehensive step-by-step test:\n(1) What was provided: Determine what goods and\/or services the supplier provided for the consideration received (O.A. Brown Ltd. v. The Queen; Global Cash Access (Canada) Inc. v. The Queen, ;Great-West Life Assurance Co. v. The Queen; SLFI Group v. The Queen; CIBC v. The Queen2).\n(2) Single compound supply or multiple supply: Determine whether the goods and\/or services provided should be characterized as \u201ca single supply comprised of a number of constituent elements or multiple supplies of separate goods and\/or services\u201d (O.A. Brown Ltd.; Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association v. The Queen; City of Calgary v. The Queen; SLFI Group; Global Cash Access; CIBC v. The Queen3).\n(3) Determine how the resulting supply should be treated: Determine whether that supply was or those supplies were taxable supplies or exempt supplies:\n(a) Single Compound Supply: For a single compound supply, determine what the predominant element of the supply was. This analysis should focus on the purchaser's perspective of the supply. The supply will be taxed in the same manner as that predominant element (Global Cash Access; Great-West Life; SLFI Group).\n(b) Multiple Supply: For multiple supplies, determine whether each of those individual supplies was a taxable supply or an exempt supply.\nIf one of the multiple supplies was, itself, a single compound supply, apply the test in paragraph (a) to that supply (Jema International Travel Clinic Inc. v. The Queen,).\nIf there was a single consideration paid for the multiple supplies, consider whether sections 138(incidental supplies) or 139 (financial services in mixed supply) apply to nonetheless deem there to have been a single compound supply (Camp Mini-Yo-We Inc. v. The Queen,; 9056-2059 Qu\u00e9bec v. The Queen; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. The Queen; Maritime Life Assurance Co. v. The Queen; Jema International;CIBC v. The Queen).\n[56] My application of the test is as follows.\nWhat was provided\n[57] Pursuant to the contract between the Appellant and the Clients, the Appellant supplies staff who perform nursing services. The fact that they provide staff is irrefutable. The question is, does the Appellant, pursuant to their contract with their Client, provide nursing services.\n[58] Based on the evidence provided by the witnesses, I accept that they also provide nursing services. The reason for this conclusion is set out in more detail in paragraph 67. In summary, the Appellant\u2019s RN\u2019s and RPNs (which were in many instances long time employees of the Appellant) were regularly the single charge nurse responsible for running the Client\u2019s facility, thus demonstrating that the Appellant\u2019s nurses had management and control over their work (when compared to the nurses in HSC). Furthermore, the nursing duties the Appellant\u2019s nurses provided were consistently one-on -one treatments of residents. I am satisfied that the characteristics necessary to define this as a nursing service (set out in paragraph 27) are present.\nSingle Compound or Multiple Supply\n[59] As stated above, both parties took the position that the supply provided by the Appellant is a single supply. In my review of the facts of this case, I agree that the supply in issue is a single compound supply.\nTreatment of the supply\n[60] In classifying a single supply the Courts, generally look to the \u201cpurpose\u201d, \u201cessence\u201d, \u201cnature\u201d, or \u201csubstance\u201d of the supply or the circumstance surrounding the supply. Moreover, the Courts have developed various analytical methodologies for discerning such fundamental characteristics. The essence is to determine what the predominant element of the supply is.\n[61] In this instance, I find the predominant element, which the Client sought to acquire, is nursing services. I have come to this conclusion based on the following analysis.\n[62] The perspective of the purchaser is widely considered to be a key factor in classifying a supply. That is, what the recipient believes they are purchasing informs the nature of the business that supplier is engaging in.\n[63] For example in Sterling Business Academy Inc. v The Queen, the Court held that the supply of books, tuition and lectures constituted a single supply of \u201ca course of instruction\u201d as this is what the students were purchasing.[38]\n[64] Similarly, in Oxford Frozen Foods Ltd. v Canada, the taxpayer produced and sold frozen blueberries and carrots. It was argued that, the storage of food (in a freezer) was its own supply as this was a separate line item on the taxpayer\u2019s invoices to customers. However, the Court concluded that the taxpayer supplied frozen food not storage services:\nHerein, the true nature of the contract is the sale by the appellant of frozen product. This is the real character of the appellant's business. The storage of the frozen product is a necessary component to the appellant so that it can sell frozen products.[39]\n[65] In HSC, the FCA held that \u201cthe nature of the services provided by the agencies to the hospital\u201d was determinative of whether there was an exempt nursing services supply.[40] The Court concluded the facts were sufficient to find the supply was properly classified as a placement service rather than nursing services.[41] However, as noted above the facts of HSC are not identical to the present case; that is, the nature of the supply the Clients purchased from the Appellant is not clear. At the risk of being redundant, I will repeat the various factors in support of both arguments.\n[66] Several factors indicate that from the Clients\u2019 perspective they were purchasing the supply of nursing personnel, purely for staffing or placement purposes. Specifically:\nthe Services Agreement contained a clause by which the Clients could pay a penalty in order to procure the right to hire one of the Appellant\u2019s nurses;[42]\nper the Services Agreement the Clients specify when they require a nurse to work;[43]\nthere is no representative of the Appellant on site when the nurses are working and there is no indication that the Services Agreement relinquishes any of the responsibilities the Clients had to provide nursing services;\nthe Appellant is responsible for recruiting, vetting, and placing nurses and specifically employees several staff to achieve this;\nthe Appellant re-trained the nurses to ensure they could meet the Clients\u2019 codes of conduct (e.g. uniform rules);\nthe Appellant does not have access to the care home patients files; and\nthe nurses do not hold themselves out as nurses of the Clients at their job.\n[67] In contrast, several factors indicate that from the Clients\u2019 perspectives they were purchasing the supply of nursing services. Specifically:\nthe Appellant\u2019s nurses were regularly left in charge of the Clients\u2019 facilities;\nthe Appellant re-trained their nurses to ensure they could perform their nursing duties as required by the Clients;\nthe Appellant provides nursing services to other private Clients;\nmany of the Appellants nurses have provided nursing services to the Clients\u2019 for several years;[44]\nthe Services Agreement required the nurses perform nursing duties;\nthe Services Agreement required the Appellant to pay the nurses wages; and\nthe Services Agreement required the Appellant to maintain general liability insurance for the nurses.\nThe Principal or Dominant Component of the Supply\n[68] Previously, in cases that deal with a single supply, which contains two or more integral components, the Court has held that the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d component should classify the supply.\n[69] For example, in Royal Bank of Canada v. The Queen, the Court had to classify a payment made by RBC to an airline in the context of an arrangement that involved RBC issuing credit cards to customers and the airline issuing points to customers. RBC argued the payment was for exempt financial services as it was made for services that were in the nature of arranging for the granting of credit. The Respondent argued that the payment was made for the consideration of the points issued by the airline (a taxable supply). The TCC considered which component was the \u201cdominant element of the supply\u201d;[45] and concluded the reward points in questions were \u201cthe most substantive aspect of the supply to which all else relates but there is in my view no substantive single supply of the financial services variety relied on by the Appellant.\u201d[46]\n[70] I have concluded that the supply the Appellant provided to the Clients is best classified as a supply of nursing services. I believe the following facts, in particular, tilt the scale towards the supply being of nursing services:\nthe Appellant already provides nursing services to private individuals meaning they are capable of providing nursing services;\nthe Appellant has employed many of its RNs and RPNs for several years and have trained them on how to meet their obligations for the Clients;\nthe Appellant regularly provides the services of a charge nurse to the Client\u2019s facilities meaning they are at least in part responsible for the provision of nursing service; and\nin order to meet the 24 hour rule the Long Term Care Home Act, in section 45, allows the Clients to meet their nursing obligations by acquiring nurses through an employment agency.\nIX. Conclusion\n[71] Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the dominant element of the supply provided by the Appellant to the Clients was nursing services.\n[72] The appeal is allowed.

THE APPEAL\n[1] Alykhan Habib Hirjee (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals an assessment issued to him pursuant to subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act,[1] in his capacity as a director of 1621844 Alberta Inc. (the \u201cCorporation\u201d). The underlying assessments issued to the Corporation were for unremitted GST\/HST and interest, for reporting periods in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nII. PRELIMINARY MATTERS\nA. Confidentiality Order\n[2] I issued an Order dated October 3, 2022 that the transcript of the hearing would be confidential. The basis for the Order was that intimate details of the Appellant\u2019s mental health and other medical issues would be presented at trial and form the basis of the Appellant\u2019s due diligence defence. I determined that the privacy of the Appellant in respect of these matters outweighed the public interest in having the transcript of the hearing made publicly available. For similar reasons, portions of this decision have been redacted.\nIII. BACKGROUND FACTS\n[3] The Appellant, his brother, Nadim Hirjee, the Appellant\u2019s wife, Dr. Alysha Hirjee, and the Corporation\u2019s bookkeeper, Charmaine Moore, all testified. I found all of them to be credible. As the Appellant acknowledged, his memory of certain events lacked detail, which he attributed to his mental health challenges during the relevant period.\nA. The Bell Mobility Stores\n[4] The Appellant resides in Edmonton, Alberta. In 2003, the Appellant started work at a Bell Mobility store in Calgary. He moved to Edmonton to attend school, and graduated with a business management diploma in 2006. The Appellant worked for a Bell Mobility store in Edmonton while attending school. In or around 2006, the Appellant incorporated Connected Holdings Inc. to open two Bell Mobility stores in northern Alberta (Cold Lake and Bonnyville).\n[5] In or around 2009, the Appellant joined forces with Chehayeb Toufic and incorporated 1600013 Alberta Ltd. to operate Bell Mobility stores in Saskatchewan. Two stores were opened in 2010-2011. Both the Appellant and Mr. Toufic were directors, but Mr. Toufic was \u201c99% responsible\u201d for the operation of the Bell Mobility stores in Saskatchewan.\n[6] In or around 2011, Bell Mobility approached the Appellant to open new stores in Alberta and agreed to pay for the stores\u2019 opening costs. The Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Alberta on August 3, 2011 for that purpose. The shareholders of the Corporation were Hirjee Holdings Inc. (a corporation owned by the Appellant\u2019s mother and brother) and Secure Holdings Inc. (a corporation owned by the Appellant\u2019s uncle and other investors). The Appellant had no shares in the Corporation but was the sole director.\n[7] The Corporation opened four new Bell Mobility stores in Alberta (Namao, Sherwood Park, Grand Prairie and Airdrie) in late 2012 and early 2013. Each of the Bell Mobility stores bought cellphones from Bell Mobility and sold them to customers who would sign up for cellphone packages with Bell Mobility. Revenues were derived in small part from phone sales and minor accessories, but largely from commissions paid by Bell Mobility in respect of service packages sold to customers. Local managers ran the stores, but the Appellant oversaw the operations, as he was very familiar with the Bell Mobility contracts and business model and dealt directly with Bell regarding inventory and contract terms.\n[8] The Corporation started to run into financial difficulty, in part because costs for the buildout of the stores were greater than anticipated and because Bell Mobility changed the commission structure. The timing of these events did not come out in the evidence although one would expect that the cost overruns occurred early in the life of the four stores.\n[9] The four stores operated from late 2012\/early 2013 to sometime in 2016, when they were sold. From 2014 to 2016, the Corporation had 25-30 employees.\nB. Assessment of the Corporation\n[10] 2013: The Corporation filed a GST\/HST return for the annual reporting period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, claiming a refund. The return was due to be filed on March 31, 2014. There was no evidence as to when the return was filed. The CRA conducted a pre-refund audit and on December 3, 2015 the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) assessed the Corporation for unremitted net GST\/HST for 2013 of $410,465.25 denying all claimed input tax credits.\n[11] 2014: On March 30, 2016, and April 4, 2016, the Minister assessed the Corporation \u201cas filed\u201d for the quarterly periods from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, for unremitted net GST\/HST of $167,129.40 in total. There was no evidence as to when the returns for the 2014 quarterly reporting periods were filed, but since the reassessments were issued on an \u201cas filed\u201d basis, and reflected interest charged for each period, it appears that all of the returns were late filed.\n[12] 2015: On April 25, 2016, the Minister assessed the Corporation for the quarterly reporting periods from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 for unremitted net GST\/HST of $167,129.40 in total. The assessment was based on the average amount of net GST\/HST owed for each quarterly reporting period in 2014 on the basis that no GST returns had been filed for the 2015 reporting periods.\n[13] The Corporation did not object to the assessments. On January 17, 2017, the Minister registered the Corporation\u2019s GST\/HST liability by certificate with the Federal Court of Canada, which issued a writ for $584,520.15 (the \u201cWrit\u201d). The Corporation had no assets to seize, levy or take and the Writ was returned nulla bona. The debt registered in the Writ has not been satisfied.\nC. Assessment of the Appellant\n[14] On January 31, 2017, the Minister assessed the Appellant as director of the Corporation under subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act for the unremitted net GST\/HST and interest as follows (the \u201cAssessment\u201d):\nReporting Period End Date\nFiling\/\nRemittance Due Date\nAssessment Date\nTax\nInterest\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2013 (full year)\nMarch 31, 2014\nDecember 3, 2015\n$136,467.70\n$51,473.12\n$187,940.82[2]\nMarch 31, 2014\nApril 30, 2014\nMarch 30, 2016\n$ 4,527.31\n$ 668.90\n$5,196.21\nJune 30, 2014\nJuly 31, 2014\nMarch 30, 2016\n$ 38,885.40\n$ 5,186.20\n$44,071.60\nSeptember 30, 2014\nOctober 31, 2014\nMarch 30, 2016\n$ 57,527.58\n$ 6,856.07\n$64,383.65\nDecember 31, 2014\nJanuary 31, 2015\nApril 4, 2016\n$ 66,189.11\n$ 6,960.65\n$73,149.76\nMarch 31, 2015\nApril 30, 2015\nApril 25, 2016\n$ 41,782.25\n$ 3,834.43\n$45,616.68\nJune 30, 2015\nJuly 31, 2015\nApril 25, 2016\n$ 41,782.25\n$ 3,263.18\n$45,045.43\nSeptember 30, 2015\nOctober 31, 2015\nApril 25, 2016\n$ 41,782.25\n$ 2,699.08\n$44,481.33\nDecember 31, 2015\nJanuary 31, 2016\nApril 25, 2016\n$ 41,782.25\n$ 2,142.58\n$43,924.83\nTotal\n$470,726.10\n$83,084.21\n$553,810.31\n[15] On April 28, 2017, the Appellant duly objected. On December 5, 2017, the Minister confirmed the Assessment.\nD. Concession of the Respondent\n[16] At trial, an issue regarding the dissolution of the Corporation (on February 2, 2015) arose as potentially bearing on the periods in dispute. In a joint letter to the Court dated October 18, 2022, the parties agreed that as of the date of dissolution, the Appellant ceased to be a director and accordingly could not be liable as a director for tax liabilities of the Corporation arising after that time.[3] Accordingly, the Respondent concedes that the Appellant is not liable for amounts assessed in respect of the Corporation\u2019s reporting periods ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The total amount assessed for those periods is $179.068.27. The total amount assessed for the periods that remain in dispute is $374,742.04.\nE. The Expert Report\n[17] Dr. Pratap Chokka, MD, FRCPC was asked to provide an expert report by the Appellant\u2019s counsel on the Appellant\u2019s medical condition during the period December 31, 2013 to January 31, 2016 (the \u201cMedically Assessed Period\u201d). Dr. Chokka is a licensed psychiatrist in Alberta and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. At the time of the report, he was a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Alberta and an attending psychiatrist at the Grey Nuns Hospital in Edmonton. His main areas of interest in psychiatry include mood and anxiety disorders, specifically bipolar disorder, ADHD and reproductive psychiatry. Dr Chokka reviewed the Appellant\u2019s medical records and met with the Appellant on March 3, 2020. The report is dated March 30, 2020 (the \u201cExpert Report\u201d).\n[18] Prior to the hearing, the Appellant requested an order, not contested by the Respondent, waiving the requirement in Rule 145(7)(c) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure)[4] that the expert be available for cross-examination at the hearing. The expert was not available on the scheduled hearing dates. I issued the Order with the caution that the expert\u2019s absence might affect the weight given to the report, if admitted. The admissibility of the Expert Report would be determined at the hearing.\n[19] At the hearing, the Appellant addressed the criteria for admissibility of the Expert Report set out in Her Majesty the Queen v. Chikmaglur Mohan[5] (the \u201cMohan criteria\u201d). The Respondent did not challenge the admissibility. I concluded that the Mohan criteria had been met: the Expert Report is central to the Appellant\u2019s due diligence defence, outside the expertise of the Court, there is no relevant exclusionary rule and Dr. Chokka is professionally qualified to express the views in the report, subject to one caveat. The Expert Report draws conclusions about whether the Appellant was prevented from exercising \u201cthe degree of care, diligence, and skill that led to the Corporation\u2019s failure to remit\u201d and could not be \u201ca reasonably prudent person\u201d, which I reminded the Appellant were determinations for this Court to make, not Dr. Chokka.\n[20] The salient parts of the Expert Report are:\n1. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | || ||\n2. |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | | | | | ||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||\n3. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | | | | |\n4. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | ||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||\n5. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n6. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | ||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||\n7. |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||| ||||||\n8. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | | | | | | |\nIV. ISSUE\n[21] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable with the Corporation for the Corporation\u2019s unremitted net GST\/HST and interest in respect of the relevant periods. Given the Respondent\u2019s concession, the remaining periods at issue are the 2013 annual reporting period and the four quarterly reporting periods in 2014.\n[22] At the hearing, the Appellant chose not to pursue various arguments put forward in the notice of appeal. The Appellant relies exclusively on the due diligence defence in subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act and his diminished mental health during the relevant period.\nV. STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n[23] The central statutory provisions of the Excise Tax Act are subsections 323(1) and 323(3) which read as follows:\n323 (1) If a corporation fails to remit an amount of net tax as required under subsection 228(2) or (2.3) or to pay an amount as required under section 230.1 that was paid to, or was applied to the liability of, the corporation as a net tax refund, the directors of the corporation at the time the corporation was required to remit or pay, as the case may be, the amount are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable, together with the corporation, to pay the amount and any interest on, or penalties relating to, the amount.\n\u2026\n323 (3) A director of a corporation is not liable for a failure under subsection (1) where the director exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances.\nVI. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nA. Position of the Appellant\n[24] The Appellant submits that he exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure by the Corporation to remit GST\/HST that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances. The Appellant submits that those \u201ccomparable circumstances\u201d include the diminished capacity of someone experiencing the same degree of mental health impairment as Mr. Hirjee did during the relevant period.\nB. Position of the Respondent\n[25] The Respondent maintains that the Appellant\u2019s mental health did not preclude him from meeting his responsibilities as a director and that the Appellant did not exercise the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the Corporation\u2019s failure to remit GST\/HST that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances. The Respondent submits that, during the relevant period, the Appellant knew that the Corporation\u2019s remittance obligations were not being met and failed to take positive steps to prevent this from occurring.\nVII. ANALYSIS\n[26] The taxes and interest that remain in issue arise from reporting periods of the Corporation that start on January 1, 2013 and end on December 31, 2014. However, since a director\u2019s liability arises under subsection 323(1) at the time the Corporation is required to remit or pay tax, the relevant period for the Appellant\u2019s potential liability for those underlying reporting periods of the Corporation starts on March 31, 2014 and ends on January 31, 2015 (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nA. Buckingham v. R.\n[27] The case law analyzes the corporate director\u2019s due diligence defence set out in subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act and section 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act[6] without distinction. In Buckingham v. R., the Federal Court of Appeal stated that there is \u201cno fundamental conceptual difference between employee source deductions remittances and GST\/HST remittances which justify a separate analysis of the duty of care, diligence and skill defence\u201d.[7] The conclusions reached in the Income Tax Act decisions apply in the context of an assessment under the Excise Tax Act, and vice versa.\n[28] Buckingham is the leading authority regarding this due diligence defence. It was followed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Balthazard v. Canada[8] and, more recently, in Ahmar v. Canada.[9] In Buckingham, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the standard of care, skill and diligence required under subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act is an objective standard as set out by the Supreme Court in Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise.[10] Peoples is a decision of the Supreme Court in relation to the standard of care, diligence and skill found in paragraph 122(1)(b) of the Canada Business Corporations Act,[11] which provides that every director and officer of a corporation shall, in exercising their powers and discharging their duties, \u201cexercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances\u201d.\n[29] The Federal Court of Appeal in Buckingham concluded that with an objective standard, a director may no longer rely on his or her personal skills, knowledge or capacities to raise the due diligence defence:[12]\n[34] This caveat being stated, I agree with the trial judge that the \u201cobjective subjective\u201d standard set out in Soper has been replaced by the objective standard laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in Peoples Department Stores. I come to this conclusion in light of the language used in subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and in subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act, and also by applying the principle of the presumption of coherence between statutes.\n\u2026\n[38] This objective standard has set aside the common law principle that a director\u2019s management of a corporation is to be judged according to his own personal skills, knowledge, abilities and capacities: Peoples Department Stores at paras 59 to 62. To say that the standard is objective makes it clear that the factual aspects of the circumstances surrounding the actions of the director are important as opposed to the subjective motivations of the director: Peoples Department Stores at para 63. . . .\n[Emphasis added.]\n[30] Other key aspects of the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in Buckingham are that a director\u2019s conduct should be evaluated at the time that he or she became aware that the company was entering a period of financial difficulties[13] and that the director\u2019s duty is to prevent the failure to remit rather than to correct the failure to do so:[14]\n[33] \u2026 The directors must thus establish that they exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill required \u201cto prevent the failure\u201d. The focus of these provisions is clearly on the prevention of failures to remit.\n\u2026\n[49] The traditional approach has been that a director\u2019s duty is to prevent the failure to remit, not to condone it in the hope that matters can be rectified subsequently: Wheeliker v. R., [1999] 3 F.C. 173 (Fed. C.A.) at para. 35, Ruffo c. R., 2000 D.T.C. 6317, [2000] 4 C.T.C. 39 (Fed. C.A.). Contrary to the suppliers of a corporation who may limit their financial exposure by requiring cash-in-advance payments, the Crown is an involuntary creditor. The level of the Crown\u2019s exposure to the corporation can thus increase if the corporation continues its operations by paying the net salaries of the employees without effecting employee source deductions remittances, or if the corporation decides to collect GST\/HST from customers without reporting and remitting these amounts in a timely fashion. In circumstances where a corporation is facing financial difficulties, it may be tempting to divert these Crown remittances in order to pay other creditors and thus ensure the continuation of the operations of the corporation. It is precisely such a situation which both section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act and section 323 of the Excise Tax Act seek to avoid. The defence under subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and under subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act should not be used to encourage such failures by allowing a due diligence defence for directors who finance the activities of their corporation with Crown monies on the expectation that the failures to remit could eventually be cured.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[31] In Balthazard, the Federal Court of Appeal found that it is important for directors to act quickly in order to avail themselves of a due diligence defence; quick decisions are important because the farther a business falls behind in its taxes, the more difficult it becomes to argue that the business is not using Crown remittances to operate.[15]\nB. The Relevance of Mental Health Impairment\n[32] Subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act provides that \u201ccomparable circumstances\u201d must be considered in determining what a reasonably prudent person would have done. As the Court stated in Buckingham:[16]\n[39] An objective standard does not however entail that the particular circumstances of a director are to be ignored. These circumstances must be taken into account, but must be considered against an objective \u201creasonably prudent person\u201d standard. As noted in Peoples Department Stores at paragraph 62:\nThe statutory duty of care in s. 122(1)(b) of the CBCA emulates but does not replicate the language proposed by the Dickerson Report. The main difference is that the enacted version includes the words \u201cin comparable circumstances\u201d, which modifies the statutory standard by requiring the context in which a given decision was made to be taken into account. This is not the introduction of a subjective element relating to the competence of the director, but rather the introduction of a contextual element into the statutory standard of care. It is clear that s. 122(1)(b) requires more of directors and officers than the traditional common law duty of care outlined in, for example, Re City Equitable Fire Insurance, supra [[1925] 1 Ch. 407].\n[Emphasis added.]\n[33] As the standard is objective, attributes personal to a director, such as lack of experience or knowledge would not qualify as a \u201ccomparable circumstance\u201d. By contrast, facts external to the director but which are part of the context in which the director acts are considered. These may include, for example, historical competence of staff and systemic compliance[17], a bank\u2019s de facto control of a corporation\u2019s finances[18] and the control of a corporation\u2019s affairs by dangerous criminals.[19]\n[34] Here, the Appellant argues that the diminished mental health of the Appellant during the Relevant Period is to be considered a \u201ccomparable circumstance\u201d applicable to the notional \u201creasonably prudent person\u201d. Accordingly, I have considered whether this approach is appropriate or whether the Appellant\u2019s mental health is otherwise relevant in determining the Appellant\u2019s potential liability as a director for the failed remittances.\n[35] Decisions of this Court have considered a director\u2019s mental health as relevant to the due diligence defence. In Attia v. R,[20] Justice B\u00e9dard took the director\u2019s depression into account as well as the concrete and positive steps taken by the director to prevent the failure to remit GST. The appeal was allowed:\n[13] Indeed, the appellant was the sole director of the corporation, and until he became ill, the corporation had always met its tax obligations, even though it had sometimes been late. In addition, the fact that he appointed a competent manager to replace him until he got back on his feet shows that he was aware of his responsibilities.\n[14] The evidence adduced satisfied me that the appellant suffered from major depression during the periods at issue, and it is common knowledge that :depression is a disabling condition that affects the family life, the work, the eating habits, the sleep and the general well-being of those who suffer from it. Although it is not in itself a defence, I believe that this factor is one that must be taken into account in analyzing the appellant\u2019s conduct.\n[15] \u2026 In this case, I believe that the appellant has shown a sufficient degree of diligence in delegating his duties to a competent manager, whose competence and honesty he had no reason to doubt, and I believe that a reasonable person placed in comparable circumstances would have done nothing more.\n[16] The appellant took a concrete and positive step to try to prevent the corporation\u2019s failures to remit GST. He did not simply let his corporation decline \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[36] According to Justice B\u00e9dard, the director\u2019s condition, although a relevant factor, would have been insufficient to relieve liability. By hiring a manager, the director took positive and concrete steps to remit GST. In doing so, the Court determined that he exercised his duty of care since a reasonably prudent person placed in comparable circumstances would not have done more to prevent the corporation\u2019s failure to remit GST.\n[37] In Wiseman v R.,[21] the appellant director claimed that his depression and anxiety following his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis made it difficult for him to take over tasks previously handled by his wife, also a principal in the business. The Court did not accept that the appellant\u2019s diminished mental health was sufficient to provide him with a due diligence defence since he \u201cdid nothing to prevent the failure by Microtax to remit GST.\u201d[22]\n[38] This Court adopted similar reasoning in Doncaster v. R.[23] The appellant director in that case submitted that his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder should be taken into account in assessing the availability of the due diligence defence. The Court distinguished the facts from those in Attia:\n[84] While I am sympathetic to the problems caused by his medical conditions, I cannot ignore the fact that the appellant was aware for some time that DCI\u2019s GST returns were not being filed and that net tax was not being remitted to the Receiver General.\n[85] \u2026 The appellant's disorders did not prevent him from seeking assistance when needed. I do not see any reason why the appellant could have not done the same with respect to filing DCI\u2019s GST returns.\n\u2026\n[87] In my view, Attia is distinguishable from the facts of this appeal. Unlike Mr. Attia, the appellant did not take any positive steps to prevent the failure of the corporation to pay its net tax.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[39] Attia suggests an approach which considers the director\u2019s diminished mental health as a \u201ccomparable circumstance\u201d and asks what a reasonably prudent person experiencing the same condition would do. I have concerns with this approach as it risks blurring the distinction made in Buckingham between the factual aspects of the circumstances surrounding the actions of the director (which are relevant) and the personal skills, knowledge, abilities or capacities of the director (which are not).[24] It potentially introduces a subjective diminished capacity test \u2013 based on the actual diminished capacity of the particular director - which Buckingham tells us is no longer appropriate.\n[40] That being said, I have concluded that even with an objective standard, there must be some departure in the case of serious mental illness to avoid attaching liability for failures which an individual is incapable of avoiding. In Peck v. Canada[25] this Court considered the relevance of the personal attributes of a taxpayer in the context of gross negligence penalties, where the similarly objective standard against which conduct is measured is that of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. In Peck, the Court relied on the \u201cmodified objective standard\u201d set out in decisions of the Supreme Court, in the context of criminal negligence, for the proposition that where the test is objective, the personal attributes of an individual will be irrelevant unless they go to the individual\u2019s \u201cincapacity to appreciate or to avoid the risk\u201d.[26]\n[41] Similarly, the Ontario Court of Appeal has articulated a modified standard to that of the reasonable person in the context of civil negligence where a person experiences mental illness. The Court enunciated a test which relieves an individual from liability if, by virtue of the mental health impairment, he or she does not have the capacity to understand or appreciate the duty of care owed or is unable to discharge that duty.[27]\n[42] I have determined that it is appropriate to apply a similar modification to the objective test set out in Buckingham as the standard asks what a reasonably prudent person would do in comparable circumstances. Stated with specific reference to a director\u2019s duties to remit tax and mental illness, the question becomes whether the director can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that because of mental illness (a) he or she was incapable of understanding or appreciating the duty to prevent a failure of the Corporation to remit, or, (b) (even if this was understood) he or she was unable to discharge that duty.\n[43] I acknowledge that a director with mental health incapacity may be ineligible to hold office or cease to hold office as provided in the governing corporate law, rendering the director\u2019s potential liability moot.[28] However, that is not the case here and there will no doubt be other circumstances in which a director remains in office but experiences serious mental illness.\n[44] Here, the Appellant did not argue that he lacked the capacity to appreciate the duty to prevent the Corporation\u2019s failure to remit during the Relevant Period and there was no evidence to support that conclusion. I have therefore considered whether the Appellant\u2019s diminished mental health during the Relevant Period was such that he was unable to avoid the failures to remit, as the Appellant submits.\nC. The Need to Take Steps\n[45] As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Buckingham, \u201ca director must carry out the duties of that function on an active basis and will not be allowed to defend a claim for malfeasance in the discharge of his or her duties by relying on his or her own inaction\u201d.[29] To put forward a due diligence defence, a director must be able to show that they took active identifiable steps to prevent the failure to remit.\n[46] Here, the Appellant\u2019s expert determined that during the Medically Assessed Period, |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||. The Respondent does not contest this conclusion but submits that notwithstanding the Appellant\u2019s medical condition, he was aware during the Relevant Period of the Corporation\u2019s obligation to remit GST\/HST and ought to have taken steps to prevent the failure to remit. The Respondent relies on the decisions in Attia and Doncaster and submits that this failure to take steps is fatal to the Appellant\u2019s due diligence defence.\n[47] The Appellant acknowledges the obligation of a director to \u201ctake steps\u201d to prevent failures to remit, but relies, in part, on the fact that the Appellant set up a system for the Corporation\u2019s GST\/HST compliance. The Appellant also relies on Labrecque in support of the position that a failure to take steps will not be fatal to a due diligence defence where the director is unable to act. The Appellant submits that his mental health rendered him unable to prevent the failures to remit GST\/HST.\n[48] In Labrecque, the appellant director lost control of the corporation\u2019s affairs to dangerous criminals who threatened retaliation if the appellant did not follow orders. The Tax Court observed:[30]\n[9] Thus, although it is insufficient in itself to exempt a director, the imposition of such external constraints on a director\u2019s exercise of discretion still remains, in my opinion, part of the circumstances that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the standard of reasonable care, diligence and skill.\n\u2026\n[13] In my opinion, the fact that no positive action was taken to attempt to prevent the failure to remit is not fatal if it has been determined that external constraints (such as psychological, economic and social control) were such that a reasonable person who was a victim of the same control would have done nothing.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[49] The Appellant submits that similarly, the \u201cconstraint\u201d that made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for the Appellant to discharge his duties as a director or \u201cpowerless to act\u201d was the Appellant\u2019s mental health impairment. The Appellant submits that it affected his ability to function, both personally and professionally.\n[50] Labrecque is not directly relevant to the Appellant\u2019s situation, as that case involved factors external to the director that were considered to prevent the director from action. Nonetheless, the debate between the parties here boils down to a similar issue - whether during the Relevant Period the Appellant had become unable to take further steps to prevent the failures to remit, as a result of mental illness.\nD. The Corporation\u2019s Process for Filing GST\/HST Returns\n[51] The Appellant submits that during the Relevant Period he was unable to prevent the failures to remit, but relies, in part, on the \u201csystems\u201d put in place prior to that time to prevent the failures in support of a due diligence defence.\n[52] The Appellant and Ms. Moore testified about the process for the collection and remittance of GST\/HST and filing of returns. In 2013, the Appellant hired Shu Ying Hu as an administrative assistant for the Corporation. Ms. Moore was hired in 2012 as an external bookkeeper. The process for the filing of GST\/HST returns involved: Ms. Hu gathering information and documentation (including invoices and receipts) and providing the same to Ms. Moore. Ms. Moore prepared monthly financial information, using accounting software. This included a summary of GST\/HST collected, remitted and payable. If information was missing, Ms. Moore would follow up with Ms. Hu and\/or the Appellant. The Appellant\u2019s input was needed particularly with respect to details of the business arrangement with Bell. As the Appellant and Ms. Moore testified, the Bell commission system was complicated.\n[53] Ms. Moore would then provide the information and documentation to the Corporation\u2019s accountant, Mr. Adatia. Mr Adatia would prepare the GST\/HST returns and then send them to the Appellant for signature and payment of the balance owing. The Appellant was the only person with signing authority for the Corporation\u2019s bank account.\n[54] The Respondent argued that the Appellant\u2019s condition did not prevent him from: (a) ensuring the Corporation was current on its payroll source deductions; (b) ensuring 1503264 Alberta Ltd. was current on its GST and payroll source deduction obligations; and (c) filing personal tax returns and paying personal taxes. These facts, while not disputed, are explained.\n[55] The Corporation used Ceridian, a payroll service company, to calculate and remit payroll taxes. Ms. Hu collected payroll information and provided it to Ceridian. The Appellant was not part of that process. 1503264 Alberta Ltd. was a corporation of which the Appellant\u2019s brother and mother were shareholders and directors; the Appellant was neither. As for personal taxes, the Appellant\u2019s spouse would arrange to have both of their personal tax returns prepared and would only need the Appellant to sign his return. As the Appellant was not materially involved in any of these filings or associated tax payments, I do not regard as significant the fact that these filings were timely made and associated liabilities paid.\n[56] The Respondent does not dispute the existence of a process for the filing of GST\/HST returns, but emphasizes that the failure at issue is the remittance of tax. Only the Appellant had control over the Corporation\u2019s bank account; only he could remit taxes. The Respondent submits that it was incumbent on the Appellant to delegate that authority or make other arrangements to ensure that GST\/HST was remitted. The Respondent\u2019s position is that a reasonably prudent person in comparable circumstances could have requested the appointment of another director, delegated signing authority over the Corporation\u2019s bank account to another person, or set up a separate bank account for the collection and remittance of GST\/HST so that the funds collected could not be used for another purpose. The Respondent\u2019s position is that a reasonably prudent person would have taken action before the failures to remit occurred.\n[57] As the Federal Court of Appeal determined in Buckingham, a director\u2019s conduct should be evaluated at the time that he or she became aware that the company was entering a period of financial difficulty. Where a corporation is in financial difficulty, and therefore subject to a greater risk of default in making tax remittances, the standard of care may be considered to rise and impose upon a director the duty to take positive action to prevent the failure to remit.\n[58] There was limited evidence on precisely when the Corporation\u2019s financial difficulties arose or the impact of particular events. As noted earlier, the cost overruns were likely established early in the life of the four stores, which I have assumed to be sometime in 2013. There was no evidence as to when the Bell commission structure changed. I note that the GST\/HST returns filed for the Corporation\u2019s 2013 and 2014 years reflect increasing revenues from 2013 ($2,736,435) to 2014 ($3,085,042) and in each quarter in 2014 (Q1\u2011$670,488, Q2\u2011$756,909, Q3-$791,312, Q4-$866,333).\n[59] The first failure to remit in issue occurred on March 31, 2014 and the last on January 31, 2015. In light of the lack of evidence as to when the Corporation\u2019s financial difficulties became serious, I have considered the Appellant\u2019s conduct in 2013, 2014 and up to January 31, 2015.\n[60] The fact that the Appellant had set up a process in or around 2012-2013 for the filing of GST\/HST returns and payment of taxes, likely before the Corporation started to experience financial difficulty, is relevant but not sufficient to provide the Appellant with a due diligence defence. The Appellant continued to be involved in the management and business of the Corporation in 2013 and 2014 and would have been aware of the Corporation\u2019s financial difficulties. There was no evidence that the process for filing GST\/HST returns and payment of taxes changed at all during the Relevant Period (or after) with the onset of increasing financial difficulties or decline in the Appellant\u2019s mental health. The Appellant remained an essential part of the process for determining GST\/HST payable, the filing of returns, and the remittance of tax. No corrective steps were taken after any of the failures to remit.\n[61] Where a director becomes aware or ought to have become aware that a corporation may fall behind on its remittances, the director must take positive steps to prevent the failures to remit in order to avail himself or herself of the due diligence defence. The Appellant did not take those steps and therefore unless he is able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he was unable to take those steps, will not be able to rely on the due diligence defence.\nE. The Decline in the Appellant\u2019s Mental Health\n[62] A significant challenge with the evidence tendered at trial is that it reflects that the Appellant\u2019s mental health was good in 2012, started to decline in the spring of 2013, and was severely compromised by 2015 and 2016, with limited evidence in respect of 2014. Yet the Relevant Period starts in 2014 and ends on January 15, 2015.\n[63] The Expert Report does not address any changes in the Appellant\u2019s mental health and function during the Medically Assessed Period. That we heard through oral testimony.\n[64] 2013: ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||.\n[65] 2014: Things got worse in 2014, although the evidence in support of this is limited. The Appellant started missing appointments and deadlines. Ms. Moore describes things as \u201cstarting to unravel\u201d. She notices that the Appellant takes longer to answer her emails and phone calls to the point where it affects her ability to fulfill her responsibilities. Nonetheless, Ms. Moore completed the regular financial reporting for the Corporation for 2014 including in respect of GST\/HST, although the timing of this is unclear. As noted, GST\/HST returns were filed for all of the 2014 quarterly reporting periods.\n[66] 2015: ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n[67] Both Ms. Moore and Mr. Adatia became increasingly aware of the Appellant\u2019s condition. Both contacted the Appellant\u2019s brother when they needed information with respect to the Corporation or wanted to get the Appellant to respond to emails or requests for information. The Appellant\u2019s brother, who was also in business and used the same bookkeeper and accountant, became involved to answer their questions and fulfill some of the Appellant\u2019s responsibilities.\n[68] In 2015, Ms. Moore was no longer engaged in the Corporation\u2019s regular financial reporting; she was not getting instructions or responses from the Appellant. However, Ms. Moore was engaged in responding to the CRA GST\/HST audit of 2012 and 2013. For example, in July 2015 Ms. Moore attempted to get responses from the Appellant in connection with the CRA Audit of 2012 and 2013.[31] Ms. Moore\u2019s email dated July 17, 2015 closes with \u201cCRA-VERY IMPORTANT SO ALY PLEASE GET BACK TO ME\u201d which Ms. Moore explained was due to the Appellant\u2019s continuing lack of responsiveness. Emails to the Appellant from Mr. Adatia and Ms. Hu around the same time also include requests to respond in capital letters, likely for the same reasons.\n[69] The Appellant did not respond to emails from Bell such that they started withholding on the Corporation\u2019s line of credit. When the lines of credit reached a certain point, Bell suggested to the Appellant that they could find buyers for the stores that would assume the line of credit liability. The four stores run by the Corporation were sold on this basis in 2016.\n[70] 2016 and later years: The Namao Store was robbed at gunpoint in late 2015. An employee was tied up and phones were stolen with an aggregate value of about $50,000.[32] The Appellant never followed up to claim insurance proceeds in respect of the robbery, even though he believed he was entitled to a significant recovery. The Appellant testified that this was another example of his failure to act, even in circumstances where it would have been in the Corporation\u2019s interest to do so.\n[71] |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| | | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||\n[72] The Corporation\u2019s accountant (Mr. Adatia) quit in April, 2016. In an email,[33] the accountant states as his reasons that the Appellant has been avoiding talking to CRA regarding audits (of the 2012 and 2013 years) for 2 years, ignoring calls and correspondence and failing to advise the accountant of any conversations with the CRA.\n[73] Also in 2016, the four stores were sold. As the Appellant\u2019s brother testified, the Appellant had no capacity to operate the stores. Once the stores were sold, the Appellant\u2019s health started to improve and continued to improve in 2017 and 2018. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n[74] The period after January 31, 2015 is no longer in issue. However, the severe decline in the Appellant\u2019s condition during 2015 and continuing into 2016 provides a clearer overall picture. The detailed evidence provided for 2015 and 2016 also highlights the absence of evidence for 2014 as to a decline in the Appellant\u2019s mental health and the impact on his functioning.\n[75] I am sympathetic to the circumstances of the Corporation and Mr. Hirjee. I also recognize that the decline in the Appellant\u2019s mental health from the spring of 2013 through 2016 was not linear. Nonetheless, I am required to determine the impact of the Appellant\u2019s mental health during the Relevant Period.\n[76] As noted earlier, the Corporation\u2019s revenues continued to increase in 2014. While Ms. Moore testified that things \u201cstarted to unravel\u201d in 2014, the GST\/HST returns for 2013 and all of 2014 were ultimately filed. Given the testimony of Ms. Moore and the Appellant with respect to the process for compiling relevant information to complete the GST\/HST returns, it appears likely that the Appellant would have been involved in the information gathering for the preparation of those returns. Once the returns were ready, the accountant would send them to the Appellant for signature. Yet the balance owing, reflected on those returns, was not paid. The GST\/HST collected and not remitted might have been used to satisfy other obligations although it is unclear how that would have happened without involving the Appellant, as he was the only person with signing authority for the Corporation\u2019s bank account.\n[77] ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||| This is also reflected in the testimony of the Appellant\u2019s brother and Ms. Moore, suggesting that the Appellant was often non-responsive to requests for information in mid-2015. This was also the timeframe for the CRA audit of the Corporation\u2019s 2012 and 2013 taxation years, which the Expert Report indicates as one of the stressors causing the Appellant\u2019s mental health to decline. Based on the evidence, I have concluded that the Appellant\u2019s mental health became severely compromised during 2015, which continued in 2016 until the stores were sold. However, due to the Respondent\u2019s concession that the Appellant is not liable for any failures to remit after February 2, 2015, I have not determined whether a different conclusion on the availability of the due diligence defence might have been reached in respect of periods ending after January 31, 2015.\n[78] For the Relevant Period, I have concluded that the Appellant has not demonstrated that he exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill necessary to prevent the failures to remit that would be exercised by a reasonably prudent person in comparable circumstances. The Appellant has not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that he was \u201cunable to act\u201d or that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to act to prevent the failures to remit.\n[79] I accept that the Appellant may have had difficulty in completing small tasks at times during the Relevant Period. However, the evidence does not support a conclusion that the Appellant was incapable of taking further steps to prevent the failures to remit. The evidence suggests that during the Relevant Period the Appellant was still engaged in the business of running the stores and the preparation and filing of GST\/HST returns for the relevant reporting periods. Steps to be taken to prevent the failures to remit could include those suggested by the Respondent, or other steps to address the fact that only the Appellant had signing authority over the corporation\u2019s bank account. I agree with the Respondent that a reasonably prudent person in comparable circumstances would have taken further steps to prevent the failures to remit and that the failure to take those steps is fatal to the Appellant\u2019s due diligence defence.\n[80] While there may be situations in which a director\u2019s mental health is so incapacitating (objectively determined) that he or she may be excused from taking further steps to prevent the failure to remit, I have determined that this has not been established by the Appellant for the Relevant Period.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n[81] As conceded by the Respondent, the Appellant is not liable for any amounts that the Corporation was required to remit or pay after he ceased to be a director on February 2, 2015, namely for the quarterly reporting periods of the Corporation ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, as itemized in the Assessment.\n[82] The Appellant is liable for the amounts that the Corporation was required to remit or pay for the reporting periods ending December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, as itemized in the Assessment.\n[83] There shall be no award of costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 12th day of January 2023.\n\u201cMonica Biringer\u201d\nBiringer J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 4\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-1012(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nALYKHAN HABIB HIRJEE v.

Introduction\/Issue: [1] This appeal is brought under two federal statutes - the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Pension Plan. The appellant, Co-operative Hail Insurance Company Limited (Co-op Hail), appeals a January 25, 2019 decision of the Minister of National Revenue (Minister).\n[2] The Minister\u2019s decision was to confirm a Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) ruling made November 23, 2018, that during the period April 1 to September 30, 2016 an individual, Mr. Casey Yeomans, had carried out work as a licensed crop hail adjuster for Co-op Hail in the capacity of its employee, and not as an independent contractor.\n[3] The effect of this decision that Mr. Yeomans had worked as an employee rather than as an independent contractor is that Mr. Yeomans was determined to have been engaged in pensionable employment with Co-op Hail during the said period, per paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Canada Pension Plan, and likewise engaged in insurable employment with Co-op Hail per paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act.\n[4] In its appeal, Co-op Hail maintains that the Minister erred in concluding that Mr. Yeomans had worked as an employee of Co-op Hail, and that actually he had carried out the subject work for Co-op Hail in his capacity of independent contractor.\nII. Evidence: [5] At the hearing two witnesses testified \u2013 Messrs. Yeomans and Daniel Anderson. In 2016 Mr. Anderson was CFO of Co-Op Hail and currently is its CEO.\n[6] The evidence established that Mr. Yeomans was a secondary school teacher and vice\u2011principal. He also was a licensed crop hail adjuster and worked as such during summers, including for purposes of this appeal the summer of 2016. Mr. Yeomans had taken training to become licensed in 2012 by the Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan as a crop hail adjuster.\n[7] A licensed crop hail adjuster adjusts insurance claims of producers of various crops, such as wheat and canola, damaged by hail. The adjuster uses methods he\/she has been trained in to evaluate the value of a producer\u2019s crop loss due to hail. Producers submit claims for hail crop loss to the particular insurance company or companies, such as Co-op Hail, that they had contracted with for insurance protection from such damage. The licensed hail adjuster will attend at the claimant producer\u2019s rural fields and ascertain the value of the loss. The adjuster will seek to obtain the producer\u2019s concurrence as to the lost value the adjuster has determined. The relevant insurance company is required to pay out as insurance proceeds the agreed upon lost value.\n[8] On April 4, 2016 Mr. Yeomans and Co-op Hail entered into an \u201cIndependent Hail Adjusting Contract Agreement\u201d, specifying that Mr. Yeomans would work for Co-op Hail as an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d, in adjusting crop hail insurance claims.\n[9] The agreement provided also that there was no promise as to the frequency or number of claim adjustments for which Co-op Hail would seek Mr. Yeomans\u2019 services. Also it stated that Mr. Yeomans would pay his own income taxes and Canada Pension Plan contributions, and that Co-op Hail had no responsibility for such payments.\n[10] The agreement further provided that Co-op Hail would not directly oversee the actual work or instruct Mr. Yeomans as to how his adjusting work was to be performed. Mr. Yeomans was to keep Co-op Hail informed as to the progress of the work and will comply with any reasonable Co-op Hail requests regarding documentation and or status of particular adjusting assignments.\n[11] The agreement provided also that Mr. Yeomans was to decide the methods and means of performing his adjusting services and was to work within the requirements of his\/her provincial hail adjusting license. In carrying out his adjusting work Mr. Yeomans was to adhere to the practices and procedures described in the Crop Hail Adjustment Manual as regulated by the Superintendent of Insurance in Saskatchewan.\n[12] Mr. Yeoman\u2019s cycles of work would commence somewhat after a crop damaging hailstorm had passed through. He would be contacted by crop insurer Co-op Hail\u2019s \u201cstorm boss\u201d (and possibly as well by storm bosses of other insurers). The storm boss would have in hand various crop hail damage claims lodged with Co-op Hail by producers having crops insured by Co-op Hail. The storm boss would request of Mr. Yeoman if he would work as adjuster for all or some of these claims.\n[13] Mr. Yeomans preferred adjustment work respecting producers in the Swift Current area, being close to where he lived, and for time periods not conflicting with his family\u2019s summer schedule. He chose accordingly as to which damage claims he would accept to adjust.\n[14] In the summer of 2016 Mr. Yeomans (and other licensed adjusters) accepted Co-op Hail payment terms of $220 per day while engaged in hail crop adjusting for Co-op Hail, plus $185 per day for board, lodging and telephone, and $75 per day if working from home or returning home at day\u2019s end after working claims, plus a fixed kilometre amount for using his own vehicle.\n[15] Mr. Yeomans, as were other adjusters, was expected to use his own vehicle for the travel necessary to do adjusting work, and to provide his own boots, rain jacket and mosquito netting. Co-op Hail provided pens and paper (e.g., official claims forms), as well as the manual that licensed crop hail adjusters in Saskatchewan were to adhere to.\n[16] The work to adjust for damaged crops involved, as Mr. Yeomans specified in completing a CRA questionnaire, \u201ctravel to the fields, measuring damage, counting seed on plants, diagramming, writing notes, discussion with farmer\/insured to go over claim and get signature [on proof of loss] from farmer\/member.\u201d (\u201cMember\u201d is reference to the fact that Co-op Hail was a co-operative.)\n[17] As well Mr. Yeomans, as a licensed hail crop adjuster, was free to do similar work for other insurance companies, not just Co-op Hail, who might also seek to engage him for such work. What work Mr. Yeomans accepted was his choice, including whether to accept to adjust all or less than all of the claims requiring adjustment offered by the storm bosses of any other crop insurance companies including Co-op Hail.\n[18] If a crop insurer did not wish to work with any particular adjuster that insurer\u2019s storm boss simply would cease contacting that adjuster to discuss allocation to him\/her of claims for adjustment.\nIII. Law: [19] There are several notable decisions in the development of the Canadian legal bases for distinguishing employees and independent contractors. For years, the guiding decision was Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1986] 3 F.C. 553 of the Federal Court of Appeal. Wiebe Door in 1986 endorsed a \u201cfour-in-one test\u201d, drawing upon English jurisprudence in identifying a \u201ccontract of service\u201d (employees) and separately a \u201ccontract for services\u201d (independent contractors). In Wiebe Door the four determining factors identified, are (i) control over how the work is to be done, (ii) ownership of tools, (iii) chance of profit and (iv) risk of loss.\n[20] In 2001 the Supreme Court of Canada in 1671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 SCC 59, established that the central question was whether the person engaged to work was or was not in business on his\/her own account. Sagaz also recognized indicia, largely consistent with Wiebe Door, being control over the worker\u2019s activities, ownership of equipment, whether the worker may hire helpers, degree of financial risk, degree of responsibility for investment and management, and opportunity for profit by the worker in carrying out his\/her tasks.\n[21] In 2013 the Federal Court of Appeal in 1392644 Ontario Inc. v. M.N.R., 2013 FCA 85 (Connor Homes) established a two-step process for determining whether the individual was performing business services on his\/her own account. The first step was to ascertain the subjective intent of the parties as to what the work relationship was. The second step was to consider various objective factors as identified in Wiebe Door and Sagez through the lens of the parties\u2019 said subjective intent, to ascertain if that intent was borne out.\nIV. Analysis: [22] Here, the appellant Co-op Hail particularly cites Wray Agencies Ltd. v. M.N.R., 2003 TCC 428, decided by Rowe, D.J. of this Court in 2003, which has similar facts. In Wray the appellant insurer sold hail insurance in Saskatchewan and the worker, William Skene, was a licensed hail crop adjuster who did adjusting work for the appellant insurer. Mr. Skene was paid a per diem fee and related expenses to do his adjusting work. He had no written contract with the appellant insurer.\n[23] The Court in Wray considered the Sagaz indicia. Regarding \u201ccontrol\u201d, on occasion Mr. Skene also did licensed adjuster work for another insurer. He was not required to attend the annual industry conference of adjusters. Mr. Skene was required to use the manual for adjusting approved by the industry. Mr. Skene was able to set his own hours of work, was not required to report to the appellant and was free to accept or reject work offered to him by the corporate appellant.\n[24] Regarding \u201cprovision of equipment and\/or helpers\u201d, in Wray the corporate appellant provided an additional adjuster if needed, without cost to Mr. Skene. Other helpers could be used by Mr. Skene, at his own expense, although this was not done during the relevant period. The corporate appellant provided pens and necessary stationary, clipboard and the manual to be followed. Mr. Skene provided his vehicle and necessary clothing for working in the crop fields.\n[25] Regarding \u201cdegree of financial risk and responsibility for investment and management\u201d, Mr. Skene was paid his per diem fees and expenses including a per kilometre fee to cover vehicle expenses. It was up to him to manage his time and whatever in-home office facilities as required to adequately perform his services.\n[26] Finally, regarding \u201copportunity for profit in the performance of tasks\u201d, the Court noted that Mr. Skene\u2019s opportunity to earn more revenue was based on Mr. Skene\u2019s willingness to accept more work, and to be efficient in carrying out his adjustment assignments so in the course of the short working season more claims could be adjusted. I do not wholly concur with this latter point because Mr. Skene was not paid on a per claim adjustment basis, but rather on a daily basis. Thus he would profit by accepting more work, resulting in more days of work and therefore more pay.\n[27] In Wray the judge took note of the words of Noel, J.A., as he then was, of the Federal Court of Appeal in Wolf v. Canada, 2002 DTC 6853, that \u201cin a close case such as the present one, where the relevant factors point in both directions with equal force, the parties\u2019 contractual intent, and in particular their mutual understanding of the relationship cannot be disregarded.\u201d\n[28] Rowe DJ. noted that Mr. Skene had considerable freedom as to when he could do his work, and whether or not to accept such work, during a short summer period. He was free to set up appointments with farmers. He could organize his own schedule to the point where he could advise whether or not he could accept additional work.\n[29] Was Mr. Skene in business on his own account, per Sagaz? Rowe, DJ. found that he was, in the absence of any \u201cjarring incongruity\u201d in the overall circumstances indicating otherwise:\nThere is very little to suggest that Skene was not ready, willing, able and content to provide his services to the appellant on that very basis [i.e., of Skene being in business on his own account]. There is no jarring incongruity with the overall circumstances of the working relationship under analysis that would cause one to question the legitimacy of that characterization by both the worker and the payor in the within appeals.\n[30] In Wray the Court concluded that Mr. Skene worked as an independent contractor.\n[31] Almost immediately thereafter Rowe DJ. decided McQueen Agencies Limited v. M.N.R., 2003 TCC 430. It was similar to Wray, involving worker Ben Buchinski. Again the appellant corporation sold hail insurance in Saskatchewan. Mr. Buchinski differed from Mr. Skene insofar that his work with the appellant was as a trainee adjuster, supervised by senior adjusters. He was contacted from time to time by the appellant\u2019s principal to advise as to his learning progress.\n[32] Mr. Buchinski was found to be under the control of the corporate appellant because unlike Mr. Skene, an experienced adjuster, Mr. Buchinski had come to the hail insurance company seeking an opportunity to train as an adjuster. He did not yet know how to do adjusting work.\n[33] As well he was in no position to retain helpers. He could not yet perform adjusting services personally, but rather he assisted senior adjusters. He could not manage his own schedule because at any one time he was working under the direct supervision of a senior adjuster.\n[34] The Court concluded that Mr. Buchinski did not have the ability to perform at a level required of a person capable of providing adjusting services on his own account. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed and the Minister\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Buchinski was an employee rather then an independent contractor was confirmed.\n[35] Turning to the respondent Crown, counsel cited AE Hospitality Ltd. v. M.N.R., 2019 TCC 116, per D\u2019Auray J. of this Court. In this matter the appellant corporation hired supervisors, servers, bartenders and chefs for catering companies. Were these persons employees or independent contractors? The Court found that the appellant and catering companies had mechanisms in place that in effect exerted control over workers, however experienced they may be, for both small and large events. The appellant and catering companies were not just present to coordinate. They had the residual authority to instruct staff, if felt necessary, as to what to do and how to do it.\n[36] Also the appellant selected who were to be offered shifts for events and decided which functions wait staff would occupy. Head chefs selected chefs who would work at any given event. These control factors were found to indicate an employment relationship.\n[37] As for the ownership of tools factor, such as wine bottle openers, bartending kits, aprons etc.; with the exception of bar kits the appellant made such items always available. Justice D\u2019Auray found this a neutral factor.\n[38] Regarding \u201cchance of profit\/risk of loss\u201d as described by the Court, the Court concluded that working more or fewer hours does not equate to a chance of profit or a risk of loss. I am not wholly in agreement. As for \u201cchance of profit\u201d, it seems to me that to the extent additional hours or shifts are readily available to be worked should the worker so choose, correspondingly the worker is enabled to more promptly earn a non\u2011entrepreneurial profit, in the sense of potential to earn funds surplus to the quantum of select or all expenses.\n[39] However, as for \u201crisk of loss\u201d, it is difficult to conceptualize lessened risk in the context of working fewer or more hours. And incidentally, in Wiebe Door these factors - (i) chance of profit and (ii) risk of loss - are separately identified, indicative of requiring individual consideration, rather than jointly identified as in AE Hospitality.\n[40] The AE Hospitality circumstances are not comparable to those in the case at bar. Hail Co-op exercises no similar degree of control over licensed hail adjusters. Mr. Yeomans has considerable flexibility in selecting what adjustment work he will do, including where and when. The fact that he must follow procedures set out in a manual in adjusting for crop damage is an industry expectation applicable to licensed hail adjusters generally. It does not signal control exercised by Hail Co\u2011op.\n[41] The respondent cites also the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Andre Gagnon v. M.N.R., 2007 FCA 33. This was an appeal from the Tax Court which considered the work status of 11 drywallers, orally retained by another drywaller when he had excessive work. Two of the 11 were paid on a piecework basis, and the remaining nine were paid hourly. The Tax Court had concluded that these workers were employees as their individual investment in this work was minimal, particularly as the drywaller hiring them provided many tools and supplies, even though at their own jobs they normally used their own tools.\n[42] The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the Tax Court and dismissed the appeal. The appellate court observed that the evidence had not focused on the matter of control. Control was found to have been exercised by the hiring worker, insofar as control was one of the respondent\u2019s assumptions, therefore presumed to be correct as not shown on a balance of probabilities to have been otherwise.\n[43] Finally the respondent Crown cited Maliyar v. Her Majesty, 2006 TCC 671, rendered by Hershfield J. Here the appellant worker, a mechanical engineer, was found to be an employee. The Court determined that the putative corporate employer exercised significant control over the taxpayer and his work. Work was assigned to him on a regular basis with strict project guidelines and timetables. Also the taxpayer was to use the corporation\u2019s tools and software on its premises, regardless that the taxpayer had his own software.\n[44] The Court also found there was no opportunity for profit and no risk of loss as the taxpayer earned an hourly wage and did not invest any capital. As well, the fact the taxpayer had registered a business name for GST purposes did not establish he had a business of his own. He had no other clients and did not advertise. It also was concluded that the parties\u2019 intention as to the taxpayer\u2019s work status was not necessary as traditional tests were determinative of the issue.\n[45] In determining this appeal brought by Co-op Hail concerning Mr. Yeomans I am well cognizant that dealing with the issue of employee versus independent contractor, a plethora of caselaw has accumulated over several decades since 1986 when Wiebe Door was decided. Both parties have cited judicial decisions pertinent to this case at bar.\n[46] I have determined that the appropriate decision is to allow the appeal, finding that Mr. Yeomans was an independent contractor as opposed to the Minister\u2019s decision that he was an employee. I so find for several reasons. First, the parties very clearly indicated this as being their intent, by means of their April 4, 2016 written agreement. Thus, following O\u2019Connor Homes, I have looked at the factual circumstances through the lens of the parties\u2019 subjective perspective that Mr. Yeomans\u2019 worker status vis-\u00e0-vis Co-op Hail was that of independent contractor.\n[47] In particular I see that Co-op Hail exercised negligible control of Mr. Yeomans\u2019 work as a licensed hail crop adjuster. Indeed for Mr. Yeomans\u2019 adjusting work to be accepted as fair as between the insurance company on the one side and the insurance claimant on the other, Mr. Yeomans had to be seen as not simply an extension or entity of the insurance company. Mr. Yeomans had substantial freedom in deciding what damage claims filed with Co-op Hail he would accept to adjust, based on personal considerations such as proximity to his Swift Current home.\n[48] As to ownership of tools, the equipment provided by the Co-op Hail was relatively slight \u2013 pen, paper and clipboard. Co-op Hail also provided the manual issued to all licensed crop adjusters, developed not by Co-op Hail itself but by a provincially regulated body. Thus it was not Co-op Hail itself that was controlling how the adjusting work was done, but rather it was the manual, provided generally to licensed crop adjusters to serve the obvious need that adjusters use same methodologies in doing their adjusting work.\n[49] As well Mr. Yeomans provided a substantial tool, being his own vehicle to convey himself to the differing rural locations in Saskatchewan where he had accepted to work, examining various claimants\u2019 damaged crops.\n[50] As for chance of profit, in line with my above comments I consider there is some prospect of prospering (i.e., profiting) through working more rather than fewer days. More gross income would be generated, with the reasonable expectation that accordingly net income would likewise grow. I do not generally consider there to be any particular risk of loss. Of course there are always theoretical risks, such as the possibility that Mr. Yeomans could have a car accident while driving in the course of this work, leaving him unable to work at all.\n[51] In concluding, I subscribe to the Wray decision of Rowe, DJ, rendered twenty years ago. It is a well written and well reasoned decision, dealing with startlingly similar facts.\n[52] In accordance with the foregoing reasons, noting as well the principle of judicial comity, I will allow the appeal, finding Mr. Yeomans to have provided services to Co-op Hail during the 2016 period as an independent contractor carrying on business, and not as an employee of Co-op Hail. Thus for purposes of the Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance Act, during the relevant 2016 period Mr. Yeomans was not engaged in either pensionable or insurable employment.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 6th day of April 2023.\n\u201cB.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2023TCC45\nDate: 20230412\nDocket: 2018-3444(GST)G\nBETWEEN:\nTHE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF CANADA\nor BELL CANADA,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nIntroduction\n[1] The primary issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant, Bell Canada, when purchasing electricity in Ontario, received a single supply of electricity or, as argued by the Appellant, multiple supplies of electricity, delivery services and regulatory services.\n[2] During the relevant years, subsection 236.01(2) of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cGST Act\u201d) required a large business, such as the Appellant, to recapture a portion of the input tax credits that it claimed in respect of certain specified property and services, including electricity.\n[3] The issue of whether the Appellant received a single supply of electricity as opposed to multiple supplies is key when determining the amount of input tax credits that the Appellant was required to recapture under subsection 236.01(2) for its reporting periods ending between July 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012. The amount at issue is approximately $2,550,000.\n[4] The Appellant is a GST registrant that is engaged exclusively in GST commercial activities, being the selling of telecommunications services, telecommunications equipment and services related to telecommunications services and equipment.\nPreliminary Issues\n[5] The parties filed a short partial agreed statement of facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d). The PASF provides a brief description of the Appellant, notes the various Ontario electricity distribution companies (the \u201cLocal Distributors\u201d) that made supplies to it, references the 106 invoices issued by various Local Distributors that are included in the Joint Book of Documents, and describes the audit of the Appellant and the assessments issued by the Minister. The PASF contains few relevant facts with respect to the issue before the Court.\n[6] I heard from three witnesses: Mr. William Ferris, the Director of Real Estate Operations for the Appellant, Mr. John Todd, the President of Elenchus Research Associates, Inc., and Mr. Travis Lusney, the Director of Power Systems at Power Advisory LLC.\n[7] Since the primary issue in this appeal is whether each supplier (i.e. a Local Distributor) made a single supply or multiple supplies, I expected to hear testimony from employees of one or more of the Local Distributors. This did not occur. As a result, the Court received only general details of how the Local Distributors operate when making supplies. For example, while the parties provided the Court with numerous invoices issued to the Appellant by various Local Distributors, the parties did not file any contracts that the Appellant entered into with Local Distributors. Nor did the parties provide the Court with any contracts or details of any contracts that Local Distributors entered into with their suppliers.\n[8] Mr. Ferris\u2019s testimony related mainly to how the Appellant powered its networks and to the 106 sample invoices included in Exhibit A-1, focusing on the four categories of items set out on the invoices. I did not find his testimony with respect to the invoices particularly helpful since the invoices speak for themselves and, as I will discuss, the Local Distributors were required, pursuant to subsection 79.17(1) of the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998[1] (the \u201cOEB Act\u201d) and the relevant regulations, to itemize their invoices to show the four categories of items.\n[9] In addition, Mr. Ferris\u2019s evidence was limited since he did not work for the Appellant during the years at issue in this appeal.\n[10] Mr. Todd, as the President of Elenchus Research Associates, Inc., provides advice to numerous Canadian distributors of electricity, including the majority of the Local Distributors as well as integrated electric utilities such as Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and New Brunswick Power. His advice relates primarily to operating in the various Canadian regulated electricity markets, including applying for rate increases.\n[11] He holds a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and a master of business administration in economics and management science, both from the University of Toronto. He is not a professional engineer. He stated that he has redefined himself as an economist.\n[12] Mr. Todd has never worked as an employee of a Local Distributor, a transmission company, a company that generates electricity or one of the entities that regulates the Ontario electricity market.\n[13] The Appellant first put Mr. Todd to the Court as an expert witness. After holding a voir dire, I ruled that his expert report was not admissible. The oral reasons for my ruling are attached as Appendix A. I did not find Mr. Todd\u2019s expert report necessary.\n[14] As can be seen from Appendix A, I found that Mr. Todd\u2019s answers to the questions put to him by the Appellant did not contain facts that were of such a technical nature that I required help to appreciate those facts. If a lay witness had provided the various facts set out in Mr. Todd\u2019s report, I could have formed my own conclusion without the help of an expert.\n[15] In addition, as stated in my oral reasons, the primary purpose of Mr. Todd\u2019s report is to give fact evidence; it is not to give an opinion, an inference from the facts. I do not require an expert to tell me the facts. I need a lay witness whose fact evidence can be tested under cross-examination.\n[16] After my ruling, the Appellant decided to present Mr. Todd to the Court as a fact witness. Mr. Todd\u2019s evidence was helpful with respect to the structure of the Ontario electricity market. However, he was not able to provide evidence with respect to the actual individual supplies made by Local Distributors to their various customers. Only an employee of a Local Distributor could provide such evidence. Mr. Todd could only tell me how the various regulators and the relevant provincial legislation regulated the business of the Local Distributors.\n[17] Mr. Lusney, as Director of Power Systems at Power Advisory, oversees most of the firm\u2019s analysis with respect to electricity sectors across Canada and throughout North America. Power Advisory is a management consulting firm in the electricity sector. Mr. Lusney noted that Power Advisory provides traditional management consulting services involving asset valuation, price forecasting, market assessments, strategic guidance and investment analysis.\n[18] Mr. Lusney holds a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and a master of science in electrical engineering, both from Queen\u2019s University. He is a professional engineer.\n[19] Unlike Mr. Todd, Mr. Lusney has worked for parties involved in the Ontario electricity market. Prior to joining Power Advisory, he worked for the Ontario Power Authority and, between 2006 and 2008, for a Local Distributor, Hydro Ottawa Limited. When working at Hydro Ottawa, he was responsible for supporting the planning process, in particular, the development, allocation, and justification of capital planning budgets.\n[20] The Respondent first put Mr. Lusney to the Court as an expert witness. After holding a voir dire, I ruled that his expert report was not admissible. My reasons were the same as my reasons for excluding Mr. Todd\u2019s expert report: Mr. Lusney\u2019s report was not necessary, because there was nothing in his report of such a technical nature that an expert was required. In addition, it was an attempt to adduce fact evidence through an expert as opposed to a lay witness.\n[21] The Respondent then called Mr. Lusney as a fact witness. Mr. Lusney\u2019s evidence was also helpful with respect to the structure of the Ontario electricity market. Furthermore, he was able to provide some evidence with respect to the operation of Hydro Ottawa; however, the evidence was limited since he did not work for Hydro Ottawa during the relevant period and he did not appear to have been directly involved in the making of supplies by Hydro Ottawa to its various customers.\nSummary of the Facts\n[22] The Ontario electricity market is heavily regulated.\n[23] Only registered entities can participate in the Ontario electricity market. The businesses that such entities may carry on are limited by legislation. Electricity can only be purchased for resale in the government-operated market, fees charged for transmitting electricity are set by government regulators, the total price at which entities may sell electricity to the ultimate consumers is set by government regulators, and the government dictates what can appear and how it is to appear on invoices issued to the ultimate consumers.\n[24] During the relevant period, the key players in the Ontario electricity market were the entities that generate the electricity (the \u201cGenerators\u201d), the Independent Electricity System Operator (the \u201cIESO\u201d), the entities that transmit the electricity (the \u201cTransmitters\u201d), and the Local Distributors which sell the electricity to most consumers.\n[25] The witnesses also referred to retailers. Mr. Todd noted that there are 70 licensed retailers in Ontario but that only a few are active.\n[26] Mr. Todd and Mr. Lusney provided similar descriptions of how each of the key players participates in the Ontario electricity market.\n[27] The Generators are the companies that create the electricity. The primary Generators located in Ontario are Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power (which produce power using nuclear reactors). In addition, there are a number of smaller Generators in Ontario, which generate electricity through gas-fired generation plants, solar farms and wind generators. The witnesses noted that Generators located outside of Ontario, such as Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, also sell into the Ontario electricity market. Further, electricity produced outside of Ontario may also be sold into the Ontario market by wholesalers (the \u201cWholesalers\u201d), which purchase electricity from Generators for resale.\n[28] The IESO is a government agency that manages the Ontario electricity system in real time to ensure that there is an adequate supply of electricity in Ontario on both a moment-by-moment basis and an annual basis. The Generators and Wholesalers sell their electricity through a market operated by the IESO. The market operates in real time, matching the Generators and Wholesalers that are willing to sell a specific quantity of electricity at a specified price into the Ontario market with Local Distributors, large industrial customers and Wholesalers that are willing to buy the specific quantity at the specified price. The price is referred to as the market clearing price, or the MCP.\n[29] The Transmitters carry the electricity from the Generators to the Local Distributors and to a few large commercial customers that are connected to the transmission systems (for example, steel mills in Hamilton). Hydro One and its subsidiaries own 95% of the capacity of the transmission system. Certain Indigenous organizations and a private U.S. company own the remaining 5% of the capacity.\n[30] Because of the high voltage of the transmission system, only large commercial users of electricity are able to connect to it. All other users can only access the electricity by connecting to the system of a Local Distributor. Local Distributors transform the power from high voltage to low voltage and then sell it, at a usable voltage level, to residential, commercial and small industrial users. As a result, most consumers in Ontario purchase electricity from Local Distributors. During the relevant period, the Appellant only purchased electricity from Local Distributors.\n[31] There are 61 licensed Local Distributors in Ontario. Municipalities own most of them. These Local Distributors serve their local communities. In fact, each of the Local Distributors is only entitled to sell in a designated area. The designated area is usually the area of the local municipality.\n[32] In addition to being a Transmitter, Hydro One is also a Local Distributor. It services the parts of the province of Ontario that are not serviced by the other Local Distributors.\n[33] Consumers can also purchase electricity from so-called retailers. As mentioned previously, Mr. Todd stated that few retailers were active in Ontario during the relevant period. He noted that the use of retailers was, in effect, a failed experiment. Consumers who purchase electricity from retailers must purchase transmission services from the Local Distributor for the area in which they live or operate. The Appellant did not purchase any electricity from retailers during the relevant period.\n[34] When purchasing electricity, the Appellant received supplies from various Local Distributors. The PASF states that it had no separate suppliers of, nor contracts for, electricity, transmission services and distribution services apart from the Local Distributors.[2]\n[35] As mentioned previously, the electricity market in Ontario is heavily regulated. This is done mainly through the provisions of the Electricity Act, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 15, Sched. A (the \u201cElectricity Act\u201d) and the provisions of the OEB Act.\n[36] Section 57 of the OEB Act provides that an entity must be registered before it can, among other things:\n-own or operate a distribution system;\n-own or operate a transmission system;\n-generate electricity;\n-retail electricity; and\n- sell or purchase electricity through the IESO-administered markets.\n[37] Subsection 71(1) of the OEB Act provides that a Transmitter or Local Distributor shall not carry on any business activities other than transmitting or distributing electricity.[3]\n[38] The effect of section 57 is that a Local Distributor can only carry on a business of owning or operating a transmission system if it is registered to do so. There is no evidence before me that any Local Distributor other than Hydro One carried on the business of owning or operating a transmission system. I infer from this lack of evidence that none of the Local Distributors other than Hydro One was registered to carry on the business of owning or operating a transmission system.\n[39] As a result, the Local Distributors were restricted by the OEB Act to the business of selling electricity to consumers in their defined area.\n[40] Subsection 70(11) of the OEB Act provides, in effect, that a Local Distributor can only distribute electricity in the area specified in its licence. Section 28 and subsection 29(1) of the Electricity Act require a Local Distributor to sell electricity to every person who requests to be connected to its distribution network.\n[41] These provisions are consistent with the testimony of Mr. Todd and Mr. Lusney who testified that Local Distributors must be registered, can only carry on business in their designated area, and cannot own a Generator.[4] They also testified that the Generators cannot own Local Distributors or Transmitters. Their testimony is consistent with section 81 of the OEB Act and subsection 29.1(2) of the Electricity Act.\n[42] Section 78 of the OEB Act provides that the only amount that a Transmitter can charge for the transmission of electricity and the only amount that a Local Distributor can charge for the distribution and sale of electricity is the amount set by the Ontario Energy Board. As Mr. Todd and Mr. Lusney explained, the rates that the Transmitters and Local Distributors may charge are set on a continuous basis by the Ontario Energy Board.\n[43] Mr. Todd and Mr. Lusney testified that the Ontario Energy Board uses a cost-recovery model to set the rate that a Local Distributor may charge its customers. The rate allows the Local Distributors to recover the amounts that they pay the Generators and Wholesalers when acquiring electricity on the IESO market, the amounts that they pay the Transmitters to transmit the electricity from the Generators to their distribution network, the fees that are charged by regulators such as the IESO and the costs that they incur in operating their distribution and sales network (in the OEB Act, the distribution and sales network is referred to as the retailing of electricity).[5]\n[44] The rate also includes a profit element. The profit element is calculated on the costs that a Local Distributor incurs in operating its distribution and sales network. The Local Distributors are not allowed to earn a profit on the costs that they incur to purchase the electricity, on the costs that they incur to transmit it to their distribution network or on the regulatory fees.\n[45] All the witnesses were taken to invoices issued to the Appellant by various Local Distributors. The witnesses focused on the various itemized items on the invoices that together comprise the total amount charged on the invoices to the Appellant. The individual items shown on the invoices vary from Local Distributor to Local Distributor and, for one Local Distributor, from invoice to invoice.\n[46] The OEB Act requires each Local Distributor to itemize its invoices. Section 79.17 provides that the invoices are to be in a form prescribed by regulation or approved by the Minister. The actual information required on a Local Distributor\u2019s invoice is set out in Regulation 275\/04 to the OEB Act, Information on Invoices to Low-volume Consumers of Electricity (the \u201cInvoice Regulations\u201d). Pursuant to the Invoice Regulations, the invoices issued by Local Distributors to so-called low-volume consumers, which include most residential customers and commercial customers (including the Appellant), must include the following information:\n- the heading Your Electricity Charges;\n- the following sub-headings are to be included below the Your Electricity Charges heading:\noElectricity,\noDelivery,\noRegulatory charges, and\noDebt retirement charge;\n-under the sub-heading Electricity, the amount of electricity consumed, the commodity price of the electricity and any other information required by other regulations made under the OEB Act must be shown clearly and separately;\n-under the sub-heading Delivery, the invoice must clearly indicate the total cost of the delivery charges;\n-under the sub-heading Regulatory charges, the invoice must clearly indicate the total cost of the regulatory charges;\n-under the sub-heading Debt retirement charge, the invoice must clearly indicate the total amount of the debt retirement charge payable;\n-the invoice must include information on the historical consumption of electricity;\n-the invoice must clearly indicate the consumer\u2019s consumption of electricity as indicated on the consumer\u2019s meter;\n-the Local Distributor must include, on or with the invoice, the glossary of terms set out in subsection 10(1) of the Invoice Regulations [the glossary of terms provides a description of each of the four sub-headings];\n-the invoice must include the Local Distributor\u2019s website and telephone number in a note following the glossary of terms that reads as follows: \u201cNOTE: For a detailed explanation of electricity terms, please visit (website of distributor, where available) or www.oeb.gov.on.ca\u201d; and\n-the invoice must include any messages with respect to conservation, alternative energy sources or renewable sources issued by the Minister.[6]\n[47] Section 9 of the Invoice Regulations provides that the only information that a Local Distributor can provide on the invoices with respect to the Your Electricity Charges heading and the four sub-headings is information specified in the Invoice Regulations, another regulation made under the OEB Act or in a provision or regulation made under the Electricity Act or the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit Act, 2010.\n[48] Subsections 3(2) and 4(2) of the Invoice Regulations specify how the Local Distributor is to calculate the amounts shown under the Delivery and Regulatory charges sub-headings.\n[49] Most of the invoices at Tabs 1 to 106 of Exhibit A\u20111 contain the required heading and sub-headings. However, some invoices provide more detail than other invoices. Further, not all the invoices contain the glossary of terms and the required wording with respect to the Local Distributor\u2019s website.\n[50] For example, the invoice at page 133 of Exhibit A-1, issued by Toronto Hydro-Electric System (\u201cToronto Hydro\u201d), contains the heading Your Electricity Charges; four sub-headings, namely Electricity, Delivery, Regulatory and Debt Retirement Charges; and a single amount for each sub-heading, all of which are required by regulation. The four amounts shown for each sub-heading are then added together, with the total identified as Your Total Electricity Charges. HST is then added to the total, resulting in an amount identified as Total Due.\n[51] The only information provided on the invoice in respect of each sub-heading is the single amount. No other information is provided, with one exception. Under the sub-heading Electricity, the number of kilowatt-hours (\u201cKWH\u201d) of electricity consumed and the price per KWH for the electricity are indicated. This is required by section 2 of the Invoice Regulations.\n[52] There are no calculations shown for the single amounts included under the other three sub-headings.\n[53] The invoice also contains the meter reading for the relevant month.[7]\n[54] I will refer to the Local Distributor invoices that only show a single amount for each of the four required sub-headings (including how the amount that appears under the Electricity sub-heading is calculated) as the \u201cBasic Information Invoices\u201d.\n[55] Other invoices issued by Toronto Hydro contain significantly more information under each sub-heading. For example, the invoice at pages 174 and 175 of Exhibit A-1 is for a period similar to the period covered by the invoice at page 133, but it is for a different Bell Canada location. This invoice also contains the heading Your Electricity Charges and the four sub-headings, namely Electricity, Delivery, Regulatory and Debt Retirement Charge. However, instead of a single amount under each sub-heading, various amounts are shown, as follows:\n-Under the sub-heading Electricity, three separate line items appear with an amount for each item. Each of the three line items shows the KWH and price per KWH that were used to calculate the amount on the particular line.\n-Under the sub-heading Delivery, there are seven separate line items, with an amount for each item. The calculation of six of the amounts based on KWH is shown. The seventh item is referred to as a Customer Charge.\n-Under the sub-heading Regulatory Charges, three separate line items are shown, with an amount for each item. The calculation of two amounts based on KWH is indicated. The third item is referred as a Standard Supply Service Admin Charge.\n-A single line item and amount appear under the sub-heading Debt Retirement Charge. The amount is calculated based on KWH.\n[56] All the amounts on the invoice under the sub-headings (the 13 amounts) are added together, with the total amount shown next to the heading Your Total Electricity Charges. HST is then added to the total electricity charge, resulting in the Total Due.\n[57] I will refer to the Local Distributor invoices that include more than single amounts for the four required sub-headings as the \u201cDetailed Invoices\u201d.\n[58] Nearly all the Basic Information Invoices and the Detailed Invoices contain a total of all the items on the invoice that is identified as Your Electricity Charges, Total Electric Charges, Your Total Electricity Charges, Your Electricity Charges, Total Current Electric Charges, Total Electricity Charges, Total of your electricity charges, or Electricity Charges.\n[59] Mr. Todd and Mr. Lusney explained that the separate amounts shown on Toronto Hydro\u2019s Detailed Invoice are the amounts used to calculate the relevant amount for each sub-heading in accordance with the Invoice Regulations. For example, the seven items under the sub-heading Delivery are the amounts that Toronto Hydro is required by subsection 3(2) of the Invoice Regulations to include when calculating the cost of delivery charges. The disclosure of the specific seven items under the Delivery sub-heading was not required by subsection 3(1) of the Invoice Regulations. Subsection 3(1) only requires a Local Distributor to disclose the total cost of the delivery charges.\n[60] On the basis of the sample invoices provided at Tabs 1 to 106, it appears that the majority of the Local Distributors used Basic Information Invoices, which only provided limited information similar to the Toronto Hydro Basic Information Invoice.[8] However, in addition to Toronto Hydro, a number of other Local Distributors provided more detailed information similar to the information found on Toronto Hydro\u2019s Detailed Invoice.[9] It appears that Toronto Hydro and Hydro One[10] are the only Local Distributors that issued both Basic Information Invoices and Detailed Invoices.\n[61] Some of the Local Distributors issued Detailed Invoices that did not contain the sub-headings required by the Invoice Regulations. For example, Waterloo North Hydro\u2019s invoice at Tab 43 of Exhibit A-1 provides the Electricity sub\u2011heading but then groups all other charges under the sub-heading Your Other Charges. Welland Hydro-Electric System Corp.\u2019s invoices at Tab 45 of Exhibit A\u20111 do not contain any sub-headings; all items are shown under the heading Charges & Credits. Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro lists all items under one heading: Your Electricity Charges.[11]\n[62] The Cornwell Electric invoice at Tab 68 of Exhibit A-1 only provides limited information. However, there are only two items on the invoice: one is a charge for the electricity consumed and the second is titled Debt Retirement Charge. The amount shown for the debt retirement charge is 0. No amounts are included for delivery or regulatory charges.\n[63] One other inconsistency in the Detailed Invoices included in Exhibit A\u20111 relates to the itemization of the electricity consumed. The Invoice Regulations require the Local Distributors to show, under the sub-heading Electricity, the amount of electricity consumed and the commodity price for the electricity. Most invoices have two types of charges for the electricity consumed. One is based on the amount of KWH consumed in the month multiplied by the amount that the Local Distributor paid for each KWH, and the second item is what is called the Provincial Benefit (also known as the Global Adjustment).\n[64] Mr. Todd explained that some of the Generators are paid two amounts for their electricity: the real-time market price determined when electricity is sold on the IESO market and the Provincial Benefit. The Provincial Benefit is the difference, if any, between the market price and a guaranteed minimum price offered by the Government of Ontario to certain Generators. The Local Distributors pay the Provincial Benefit to the Generators. It is then included in the price that the Local Distributors are allowed to charge their customers.\n[65] Certain of the Local Distributors that issued a Detailed Invoice, such as Toronto Hydro,[12] show the Provincial Benefit under the Electricity sub-heading, while others, such as Festival Hydro (located in Stratford, Ontario) and Waterloo North Hydro, do not include the Provincial Benefit\/Global Adjustment under the Electricity sub-heading, but rather under a sub-heading called Your Other Charges.[13] This means that Local Distributors such as Festival Hydro and Waterloo North Hydro not indicate their total cost to acquire electricity under the Electricity sub-heading. A portion appears under another sub-heading.\n[66] Since I did not hear testimony from any of the Local Distributors, it is not clear why the majority of Local Distributors provide only the basic information required by the Invoice Regulations while other Local Distributors provide more information with respect to how the charge for each sub-heading is calculated. It is also not clear why some Local Distributors do not provide the disclosure required by the Invoice Regulations or why, in at least one situation, there is no itemized charge for delivery or regulatory charges.\n[67] Each of the witnesses described items that appeared on certain of the Detailed Invoices. I did not find this testimony particularly helpful because the Local Distributors that issued Detailed Invoices were not consistent with respect to what items they itemized on invoices and because the majority of Local Distributors issued Basic Information Invoices. In addition, there is no evidence before me with respect to how the Local Distributors that issued Basic Information Invoices calculated the amounts shown under each of the four sub-headings.\n[68] The evidence that is before me is that the Ontario Energy Board, applying the Invoice Regulations, dictated the items to be disclosed on the Local Distributors\u2019 invoices, including the sub-headings to be used and the amounts that were to appear under each sub-heading. This, and the absence of evidence to the contrary, leads me to infer that the itemization is not based on what the Local Distributors believed that they supplied, but rather on what they were required to itemize under the Invoice Regulations. I would require contradictory evidence from a Local Distributor to reach a different conclusion.\nSummary of the Law\n[69] When calculating its net tax under subsection 225(1) of the GST Act, a person, such as the Appellant, may claim input tax credits. Subsection 169(1) of the GST Act contains the general rules for the claiming of input tax credits. The applicable portions of subsection 169(1) read as follows:\nSubject to this Part, where a person acquires or imports property or a service or brings it into a participating province and, during a reporting period of the person during which the person is a registrant, tax in respect of the supply, importation or bringing in becomes payable by the person or is paid by the person without having become payable, the amount determined by the following formula is an input tax credit of the person in respect of the property or service for the period:\nA x B\nwhere\nA is the tax in respect of the supply, importation or bringing in, as the case may be, that becomes payable by the person during the reporting period or that is paid by the person during the period without having become payable; and\nB is\n. . .\n(c) . . . the extent (expressed as a percentage) to which the person acquired or imported the property or service or brought it into the participating province, as the case may be, for consumption, use or supply in the course of commercial activities of the person.\n[70] As a result of subsection 169(1), a person\u2019s ability to claim input tax credits is dependent on the person\u2019s intended or actual use of the property or service in the person\u2019s commercial activities.\n[71] It is not in dispute that any property or service that the Appellant acquired from a Local Distributor was acquired for consumption or use in its commercial activities. It was entitled to, and did in fact, claim on its GST tax return input tax credits equal to 100% of the GST that it paid to the Local Distributors.\n[72] However, at the time that Ontario and British Columbia agreed to be participating provinces for purposes of the GST Act, the GST Act was amended to add section 236.01, which may require a person to recapture a portion of the input tax credits that the person claimed under subsection 169(1). Specifically, section 236.01 requires certain persons to recapture the input tax credits that they claimed in respect of the tax that they paid under subsection 165(2), sections 212.1 and 218.1 and Division IV.1 on the acquisition, importing or bringing into a particular province of certain specified property or services. Section 236.01 applied to supplies made in Ontario between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2018. This period includes the years at issue in this appeal.\n[73] In order to understand how the recapture works, one must first understand how the GST is levied under the GST Act.\n[74] The GST is levied under four separate and distinct divisions, each of which imposes the tax. The four divisions are as follows:\n-Division II, which levies the tax on taxable supplies that are made in Canada. This is the tax levied on supplies that occur in Canada;\n-Division III, which levies the tax on all goods imported into Canada, regardless of whether or not the goods are subject to Canadian customs duties;\n-Division IV, which levies the tax on imported services and intangible personal property; and\n-Division IV.1, which levies the tax on property and services brought into a participating province.\n[75] Each of the divisions levies the federal GST at multiple rates.\n[76] Subsection 165(1) levies Division II tax at a 5% rate on all taxable supplies made in Canada. Subsection 165(2) levies an additional tax on taxable supplies made in a so-called participating province at the relevant rate for that province. A participating province is a province that has agreed with the federal government to share the revenue realized from the GST. As of July 1, 2010, Ontario became a participating province. As a result, an additional tax at an 8% rate is levied under subsection 165(2) of the GST Act on all taxable supplies that are deemed under the GST Act to have been made in Ontario. This results in a total tax rate of 13%, which is referred to as the HST rate.\n[77] Divisions III, IV and IV.1 operate in a similar manner. Tax at the 5% rate is levied under sections 212 and 218[14] of Division III and Division IV respectively. The additional tax on supplies consumed in participating provinces (e.g. the 8% rate for Ontario) is levied under sections 212.1 and 218.1 of Division III and Division IV respectively. Division IV.1 tax is only levied at the relevant participating province\u2019s tax rate (e.g. the 8% rate for Ontario).\n[78] During the periods at issue in this appeal, subsection 236.01(2) required that input tax credits in respect of the tax payable at the additional 8% Ontario rate be recaptured for certain specified supplies made in Ontario regardless of whether the tax was levied under division II, III, IV or IV.1.\n[79] The issue in the current appeal is the amount of input tax credits that the Appellant must recapture in respect of the 8% tax that it paid under subsection 165(2) of Division II, section 212.1 of Division III, section 218.1 of Division IV or Division IV.1 on supplies made to it by the Local Distributors. It appears from the evidence before me that the Local Distributors only levied the 8% tax under subsection 165(2) of Division II.\n[80] Subsection 236.01(2) reads as follows:\nIf a sales tax harmonization agreement with the government of a participating province relating to the new harmonized value-added tax system allows for the recapture of input tax credits, in determining the net tax for the reporting period of a large business that includes a prescribed time, the large business shall add all or part, as determined in prescribed manner, of a specified provincial input tax credit of the large business.\n[81] The sales tax harmonization agreement between the federal government and Ontario allows for the recapture of input tax credits. Therefore, the recapture applied to a large business that operated in Ontario during a prescribed period.\n[82] Large business is defined in subsection 236.01(1) to mean a prescribed person or a person of a prescribed class. The relevant regulations for purposes of section 236.01 are those included in Part 6 of the New Harmonized Value-added Tax System Regulations, No. 2 (the \u201cRecapture Regulations\u201d). Both parties accept that the Appellant is a prescribed person for purposes of section 27 of the Recapture Regulations and thus is a large business for purposes of subsection 236.01(2).\n[83] As mentioned previously, the recapture applied during the periods at issue in this appeal. The periods at issue occurred during a prescribed time as defined in section 30 of the Recapture Regulations.\n[84] Since the Appellant was a large business and the reporting periods at issue occurred during a prescribed time, the Appellant was required, when determining its net tax for the reporting periods to add all or part of a specified provincial input tax credit.\n[85] Specified provincial input tax credit is defined in subsection 236.01(1) of the GST Act to mean:\n(a)the portion of an input tax credit of a large business in respect of a specified property or service that is attributable to tax under subsection 165(2), section 212.1 or 218.1 or Division IV.1 in respect of the acquisition, importation or bringing into a participating province of the specified property or service; and\n(b)a prescribed amount in respect of an input tax credit of a large business that is attributable to tax under subsection 165(2), section 212.1 or 218.1 or Division IV.1 or in respect of an amount that would be such an input tax credit if prescribed conditions were satisfied in prescribed circumstances.\n[86] Paragraph (a) is the relevant portion of the definition for purposes of this appeal. As a result, the specified provincial input tax credits of the Appellant were all of the input tax credits that the Appellant claimed in respect of tax paid at the additional 8% Ontario rate on specified property or services in respect of the acquisition, importation, or bringing into Ontario of the specified property or service.\n[87] Specified property or service is defined in subsection 236.01 to mean a prescribed property or service, or property or service of a prescribed class.\n[88] Division 3 of the Recapture Regulations contains the prescribed property and services for purposes of the definition of specified property or service. Paragraph 28(1)(e) of the Recapture Regulations prescribes specified energy that is acquired in, or brought into, Ontario.\n[89] Specified energy is defined is section 26 of the Recapture Regulations to mean:\n(a) electricity, gas and steam; and\n(b) anything (other than fuel for use in a propulsion engine) that can be used to generate energy\n(i) by way of combustion or oxidization, or\n(ii) by undergoing a nuclear reaction in a reactor for the generation of energy.\n[90] As a result of section 236.01 and the Recapture Regulations, the Appellant was required to recapture the portion of the input tax credits that it claimed in respect of the tax that it paid under subsection 165(2) on the consideration for the supply by the Local Distributors of electricity.\n[91] Further, pursuant to subsection 31(3) and section 26 of the Recapture Regulations, it was required to recapture 100% of such tax during the periods at issue.\n[92] The Appellant has raised the issue of whether the tax it paid under subsection 165(2) to Local Distributors was in respect of a single supply of electricity or multiple supplies of electricity, delivery services and regulatory services.\n[93] A taxable supply is defined in subsection 123(1) as a supply made in the course of a commercial activity. A supply is defined as the provision of property or a service in any manner, including sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease, gift or disposition.\n[94] Property and a service are also defined in subsection 123(1). Property is defined to mean any property, whether real or personal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, corporeal or incorporeal, and includes a right or interest of any kind whatever, but not including money. Service is defined even more broadly to mean anything other than property, money and certain services supplied to an employer by an employee, an officer and certain other persons. The definition of service is extremely broad. If something is not property, money or an employee service, it will be deemed to be a service for purposes of the GST legislation.\n[95] Because of the broad definitions of supply, property and service, the provision of anything in the course of a commercial transaction will potentially be subject to tax.\n[96] In view of these broad definitions, the issue frequently arises as to whether a supplier has made a single supply comprised of a number of constituent elements or multiple supplies of separate goods and\/or services.\n[97] The determination of this issue involves two steps. First, it must be determined whether the supplier made a single supply or multiple supplies; that is a question of fact. If it is determined that the supplier made multiple supplies, the deeming provisions in sections 138 and 139 of the GST Act must be considered.\n[98] When determining the factual question of whether a supplier has made a single supply or multiple supplies, the Court must follow the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Calgary (City) v. Canada, 2012 SCC 20 (City of Calgary). In City of Calgary, the Supreme Court adopted the principles summarized by Justice Rip (as he then was) in O.A. Brown Ltd. v. Canada, [1995] G.S.T.C. 40 (T.C.C) (O.A. Brown). In other words, the Tax Court of Canada must follow the principles set out in O.A. Brown.\n[99] O.A. Brown Ltd. carried on the business of purchasing and reselling livestock. In the course of its business, it purchased cattle at an auction and then resold the cattle to customers. After purchasing the cattle, O.A. Brown Ltd. incurred costs such as feeding, inoculating and branding the cattle before they were sold to its customers. It also incurred costs in transporting the cattle to its customers and in insuring the transportation.\n[100] When invoicing its clients, O.A. Brown Ltd. itemized each of its costs in the invoice, including the cost to purchase the cattle, the feeding and branding costs, the cost of transporting the cattle to the customer, and the cost of insurance. The invoice also included a commission charge equal to approximately 1% of the value of the cattle purchased.\n[101] In O.A. Brown, the respondent argued that O.A. Brown Ltd. supplied two things: cattle and a service. She focused on the fact that O.A. Brown Ltd. itemized each of its costs. The respondent argued that this was evidence that O.A. Brown Ltd. dealt separately with each good or service that it sold to its customers.\n[102] O.A. Brown Ltd. argued that the commission, inoculation, branding and transportation costs were not distinct services. They were inputs for the supply of the cattle.\n[103] In deciding that O.A. Brown Ltd. made a single supply, Justice Rip provided the following framework for making the factual determination of whether a supplier has made a single supply or multiple supplies:\nIn deciding this issue, it is first necessary to decide what has been supplied as consideration for the payment made. It is then necessary to consider whether the overall supply comprises one or more than one supply. The test to be distilled from the English authorities is whether, in substance and reality, the alleged separate supply is an integral part, integrant or component of the overall supply. One must examine the true nature of the transaction to determine the tax consequences. . . .[15]\n[104] When reaching his decision, Justice Rip made the following observations:\nOne factor to be considered is whether or not the alleged separate supply can be realistically omitted from the overall supply. This is not conclusive but is a factor that assists in determining the substance of the transaction. . .\nThe fact that a separate charge is made for one constituent part of a compound supply does not alter the tax consequences of that element. Whether the tax is charged or not charged is governed by the nature of the supply.\nIn each case it is useful to consider whether it would be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service.\nFor if it is not possible then it is a necessary conclusion that the supply is a compound supply, which cannot be split up for tax purposes. [16]\n[105] Justice Rip noted the importance of using common sense when the determination is made. As my former colleague Justice McArthur noted in Gin Max Enterprises Inc. v. The Queen at paragraph 18:\nFrom a review of the case law, the question of whether two elements constitute a single supply or two or multiple supplies requires an analysis of the true nature of the transactions and it is a question of fact determined with a generous application of common sense. . . . [17]\n[106] The issue in City of Calgary was whether the city made a single supply of the acquisition and construction of certain transit facilities or whether it made two supplies: a supply to the public of operating its transit facilities and a separate supply to the Province of Alberta of acquiring, constructing and making available the transit facilities to the citizens of Calgary.\n[107] The Supreme Court of Canada adopted Justice Rip\u2019s framework previously set out at paragraph 103 of my reasons in this appeal. The Court also noted the following, at paragraph 36 of its reasons:\nWhen reaching his decision, Justice Rip made the following observation:\n. . . one should look at the degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are interconnected, the extent of their interdependence and intertwining, whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. [p. 40-6]\n(Citing Mercantile Contracts Ltd. v. Customs & Excise Commissioners, File No. LON\/88\/786, U.K. (unreported).)\n[108] The Supreme Court of Canada noted that the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Maritime Life Assurance Co. v. R., [2000] G.S.T.C. 89 (F.C.A.) supports the proposition that work preparatory to, or in order to make a supply does not become a separate service subject to GST.\n[109] The Supreme Court emphasized that common sense must be used when making the determination of whether a supplier made a single supply or multiple supplies (see paragraphs 37 and 43 of City of Calgary).\nApplication of the Law to the Facts\n[110] The determination of whether a person has made a single supply or multiple supplies is done on a supply-by-supply basis. One must look at what was provided by the person to the person\u2019s customer. Normally, one cannot make a single determination in respect of supplies made by multiple persons. However, the evidence before me is that the 61 Local Distributors operated in a heavily regulated marketplace and, notwithstanding the inconsistency in their invoicing policies, all made very similar, if not identical, supplies.\n[111] Each of the Local Distributors supplied electricity that it delivered to the premises of the Appellant using the electricity system regulated by the IESO and other Government of Ontario agencies.\n[112] At paragraph 38 of its decision in the City of Calgary, the Supreme Court of Canada notes that in O.A. Brown, former Chief Justice Rip, when applying the single supply versus multiple supplies test, found that the disbursements and commission were not charged for services that were \u201cdistinct supplies, independent of the whole activity\u201d. Only if taken together did the activities of buying, branding, and inoculation form a useful service.\n[113] The Supreme Court quoted part of the following conclusion made by former Chief Justice Rip in O.A. Brown:\nThe appellant buys livestock according to the instructions of its customers. It subsequently supplies the livestock to each customer as ordered. In the course of providing this service the appellant incurs the cost of feed, inoculation, transportation and insurance. The appellant seeks reimbursement of these costs and charges a fee for this service. It is difficult to isolate these buying activities as being distinct supplies, independent of the whole activity. Only if taken together do they form a useful service. In substance and reality, the alleged separate supply, that of a buying service, is an integral part of the overall supply, being the supply of livestock. The alleged separate supplies cannot be realistically omitted from the overall supply and in fact are the essence of the overall supply. The alleged separate supplies are interconnected with the supply of livestock to such a degree that the extent of their interdependence is an integral part of the composite whole. The services are rendered under a single contract, for a single consideration, albeit the invoice is itemized. The appellant is making a single supply of livestock and the commission and disbursements charged are part and parcel of the consideration for that supply. They do not amount to separate supplies. This is simply a matter of common sense. No GST is collectible on the commission charged and the disbursements.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[114] The Supreme Court of Canada then, at paragraph 42, framed the question in the appeal before it as follows:\nApplying the O.A. Brown test, the question in this appeal is whether, in substance and reality, the alleged separate \u201ctransit facilities services\u201d supply is an integral part, integrant or component of the overall supply of \u201cpublic transit services\u201d. According to the jurisprudence, if one supply is work of a preparatory nature to another supply (an \u201cinput\u201d to that supply), then the input is a part or component of the single overall supply.\n[115] The overall supply made in the appeal before me is the supply of electricity. The customers of the Local Distributors, such as the Appellant, contracted with the Local Distributors to purchase electricity. Electricity is one of the necessities of life in Ontario, especially for business operators such as the Appellant. The Appellant cannot carry on its business without access to electricity.\n[116] Following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s application of the O.A. Brown test, I must determine in the appeal before me whether, in substance and reality, the alleged separate supplies of the delivery services and regulatory services are integral parts, integrants or components of the overall supply of electricity. If one supply is work of a preparatory nature to another supply (an \u201cinput\u201d to that supply), then the input is a part or component of the single overall supply.\n[117] The Local Distributors are prevented by legislation from producing the electricity. They must purchase the electricity on the Ontario market. They then resupply the electricity to the individual consumers, including the Appellant. In the course of providing the electricity, they incur the cost of transmitting the electricity through the Transmitters\u2019 networks. In addition, the Local Distributors must incur costs in building, operating and maintaining their distribution networks. Further, by participating in the Ontario electricity market, the Local Distributors incur various regulatory fees.\n[118] The Ontario Energy Board dictates the price that the Local Distributors can charge their customers and how such price is to be calculated. As noted previously, the Ontario Energy Board uses a cost-recovery model to determine the price that each Local Distributor may charge for the supply that it makes to its customers.\n[119] The Local Distributor is entitled to be reimbursed for the costs that it incurs in purchasing the electricity and having the electricity transmitted from the Generators to its distribution lines. It is also entitled to be reimbursed for the various regulatory fees that it incurs. Further, it is entitled to recover the various costs that it incurs in running its business, which would include the costs of building and maintaining its distribution lines and of operating a sales and service department.\n[120] The evidence before me is that the Local Distributors are entitled to earn a profit. This profit is calculated based upon direct costs that the Local Distributor incurs in operating its business. It is not entitled to earn a profit on the other costs that it incurs such as the price that it pays for electricity, the fees that it pays to the Transmitters or the fees that it pays to regulatory authorities.\n[121] The fact situation before me is very similar to the fact situation in O.A. Brown. O.A. Brown Ltd. also used a cost-recovery model to determine its sales price. It calculated its sales price based upon the cost of the cattle, the feeding and branding costs, the cost of transporting the cattle to the customer and the cost of insurance. Its sales price included a profit element equal to 1% of the value of the cattle. It did not earn a profit on the other costs that it incurred.\n[122] Similar to the situation in O.A. Brown, it is difficult, if not impossible, to isolate the costs that the Local Distributors incur when purchasing electricity, having it transmitted to their local distribution network and then distributing it through their local network as being distinct supplies independent of the whole activity. Only if taken together do these activities form a useful service, the supply of electricity.\n[123] In substance and reality, the alleged separate supplies of the delivery services and regulatory services are integral parts, integrants or components of the overall supply of electricity. The supply to the Local Distributors of the transmission services and the regulatory services is work of a preparatory nature to the supply of the electricity. Similarly, the costs that the Local Distributors incur in distributing the electricity relates to work of a preparatory nature to the supply of electricity. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in City of Calgary, such supplies are parts or components of the single overall supply of electricity.\n[124] The Local Distributors cannot supply electricity unless they purchase and transport the electricity to their customers. They are not permitted to generate electricity or own transmission lines. In order to purchase electricity for their customers and transport it to their distribution lines, they must participate in the Ontario electricity market and pay the required regulatory fees. To paraphrase former Chief Justice Rip, the alleged separate supplies cannot be realistically omitted by the Local Distributors from the overall supply and in fact are the essence of the overall supply.\n[125] In the current appeal, the fact that the Local Distributors itemize certain items on their invoices has no bearing on whether a Local Distributor made a single supply or multiple supplies. As the Court noted in O.A. Brown, \u201c[t]he fact that a separate charge is made for one constituent part of a compound supply does not alter the tax consequences of that element.\u201d One looks to the nature of the supply.\n[126] This is particularly true in the current appeal since the Invoice Regulations require the Local Distributors to itemize their invoices. As I noted previously, the fact that the Local Distributors are required to itemize their invoices leads to the conclusion that the itemization is not based on what the Local Distributors believed that they supplied, but rather on what they were required to itemize under the Invoice Regulations. In other words, the itemization is not something that the Local Distributors do to indicate that they are making separate supplies.\n[127] Further, it is difficult to give any weight to the itemization of the invoices since the disclosure on the invoices varies significantly from one Local Distributor to the next. As noted previously, the majority of Local Distributors issue Basic Information Invoices, which contain the minimum amount of disclosure required under the Invoice Regulations, the heading Your Electricity Charges and the four sub-headings. With the exception of the calculations that appear under the Electricity sub-heading, the Basic Information Invoices do not show how the amounts next to each sub-heading are calculated or what cost recoveries are included under what sub-heading.\n[128] For example, for a number of Local Distributors that issue Basic Information Invoices, it is not clear whether they are including the Provincial Benefit\/Global Adjustment charge (a charge for electricity consumed) under the Electricity sub\u2011heading or under another sub-heading. The evidence before me is that some Local Distributors that issue Detailed Invoices do not include the Provincial Benefit\/Global Adjustment charge under the Electricity sub-heading.\n[129] As discussed previously, the Local Distributors that issue Detailed Invoices are not consistent with respect to the items on their invoices and the sub-headings shown on the invoices.\n[130] In order for me to give any weight to the itemization on the Local Distributors\u2019 invoices, I would have had to hear evidence from Local Distributors explaining why they chose the Basic Information Invoice or the Detailed Invoice and how they calculated the amounts that appear under the four sub-headings.\n[131] Another issue raised by the Appellant is the fact that the Appellant could have purchased the electricity from a retailer and the transmission and distribution services from a Local Distributor. This may be true, but it has no bearing on the supplies before the Court.\n[132] The Court must make its decision based upon the supplies actually made, namely the supplies made by the Local Distributors to the Appellant. The decision cannot be based upon a supply that a third party, such as a retailer, made to another third party.\n[133] A third issued raised by the Appellant relates to fixed charges that appear on some of the invoices. At paragraph 74 of its written argument, the Appellant states its position as follows: \u201c[c]ertain of the invoices do not have charges for electricity (energy) but only have delivery charges and regulatory charges. When an invoice does not actually include any supply of electricity (energy), it is clear that the payments cannot be for a single supply of electricity.\u201d\n[134] The Appellant is referring to the Basic Information Invoices issued by four Local Distributors that are included at Tabs 94 to 97 of Exhibit A-1. Each of these invoices has the heading Your Electricity Charges, but only two of the sub\u2011headings, Delivery and Regulatory (or Regulatory Charges). A single amount appears opposite each of the two sub-headings. The amount opposite the Delivery sub-heading varies between $16 and $44 dollars. The amount opposite the Regulatory sub-heading is less than 50 cents.\n[135] During the hearing, I heard conflicting evidence with respect to the nature of the amounts itemized on these invoices under the Delivery sub-heading.\n[136] The Appellant\u2019s witness, Mr. Ferris, testified that the Toronto Hydro invoice at Tab 94 reflected a situation in which the Appellant was not consuming electricity at the particular location. However, it had decided to keep the location connected to the electricity grid. He stated that the charge on the invoice under the Delivery sub-heading was a fixed charge \u201cfor the right to be able to consume electricity at some point in the future\u201d.[18]\n[137] The Respondent\u2019s witness, Mr. Lusney, was taken to Tab 3 of Exhibit A\u20111, which contains Detailed Invoices issued by Toronto Hydro during the same period as the period during which it issued the Basic Information Invoices at Tab 94. The two sets of invoices are for different locations of the Appellant. The Detailed Invoices list six items under the Delivery sub-heading, including an amount titled Customer Charge that appears to be a fixed amount since it is not based upon KWH. Mr. Lusney described this charge \u201cas a fixed charge for the administration of delivery. . . . the need to administer invoicing.\u201d[19]\n[138] The Appellant\u2019s second witness, Mr. Todd noted that during the relevant period every Local Distributor had a service charge, a fixed charge. He stated that \u201ca service charge is a very nebulous term. . . for example, some utilities have a separate line item as a service charge for sending out the bill.\u201d[20]\n[139] As discussed previously, the Local Distributors\u2019 pricing is based upon a cost\u2011recovery model. Therefore, the amounts charged opposite the Delivery sub\u2011heading on the invoices included at Tabs 94 to 97 of Exhibit A-1 must be for the recovery of costs incurred by the Local Distributors. The evidence from Mr. Ferris, Mr. Lusney and Mr. Todd with respect to the invoices is speculation. They clearly did not know, with certainty, the specific costs that the Local Distributors incurred in respect of the charges.\n[140] Without evidence from the Local Distributors that issued the invoices, it is impossible to determine what specific costs the Local Distributors incurred in respect of the charges. However, the costs were clearly not related to the delivery of electricity since no electricity was delivered by the Local Distributors to the Appellant.\n[141] If, as Mr. Ferris testified, the charge is for the right to be able to consume electricity in the future, it could be interpreted as an amount paid pursuant to an agreement by the Local Distributor to provide electricity in the future. In such a situation, the Local Distributor would be deemed, under section 133 of the GST Act, to have made a supply of electricity. However, the Court would have to examine the contracts between the Appellant and the Local Distributors before making such a determination.\n[142] On the basis of the evidence before me, and the lack of evidence from the Local Distributors, I cannot accept the Appellant\u2019s argument with respect to the fixed charge on the invoices. It is simply not possible to determine the nature of the charge.\n[143] As I stated earlier, my former colleague Justice McArthur noted that the determination of whether there was a single supply or multiple supplies is made with a generous application of common sense. This is a factor that the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized in its reasons in the City of Calgary appeal.\n[144] In my view, any application of common sense leads to the conclusion that the Local Distributors made a single supply of electricity. The Local Distributors exist to supply electricity to the premises of local homes and businesses. The electricity is something that the local homeowners need in order to live in their homes and that the local businesses need in order to operate their businesses. They contract for the purchase of electricity, and that is what the Local Distributors supply to them.\n[145] My finding is similar to the Court\u2019s factual finding in O.A. Brown; the separate supplies alleged to have been made by the Local Distributors are interconnected with the supply of electricity to such a degree that the extent of their interdependence is an integral part of the composite whole. The provision and delivery of the electricity is rendered under a single contract, and for a single consideration, albeit the invoice is itemized. The Local Distributors are making a single supply of electricity, and the amounts itemized on the invoices for delivery, transmission, and regulatory charges are part of the consideration for that supply.\n[146] Having found that the Local Distributors made a single supply of electricity, I must consider the Appellant\u2019s alternative argument. The Appellant argued that if the Local Distributors made a single supply of electricity, the recapture rule in subsection 236.01(2) only applied to the subsection 165(2) tax paid on a portion of the single supply. It argued that the term electricity as used in section 26 of the Recapture Regulations only applies to the electricity component of the single supply of electricity and does not apply to the delivery services and regulatory services components of the supply.\n[147] I see no merit in this argument. It is an attempt to reargue the single supply versus multiple supplies issue.\n[148] The provisions under the GST Act that determine when tax is exigible, the timing of when such tax is payable, and the eligibility for input tax credits look to what is being supplied. Different rules apply to the supply of property and the supply of services. Certain supplies of specific property or services are zero-rated or exempt. The rules that exist in the GST Act to make these determinations do not look at the constituent elements of the supply; they look at the supply as a whole. It is the primary reason why one must determine whether a supplier has made a single supply or multiple supplies.\n[149] This can be seen by examining the various provisions that result in a recapture of a portion of the input tax credits claimed in respect of the supply of electricity.\n[150] Now that I have found that the Local Distributors made a single supply of electricity to the Appellant, the next step in determining whether the recapture rule in section 236.01 applies is to determine whether Division II tax was payable under subsection 165(2). Subsection 165(2) applies to a taxable supply made in a participating province.\n[151] The determination of whether tax is exigible under subsection 165(2) is dependent on whether a taxable supply was made and on whether, if a taxable supply was made, it was made in a participating province (in the current appeal, Ontario).\n[152] The supply of electricity by the Local Distributors is a taxable supply. It is a supply of property made in the course of a commercial activity. To determine whether the supply was made in a participating province one must look at the provincial place of supply rules in Schedule IX to the GST Act and in the New Harmonized Value-added Tax System Regulations. Schedule IX and the regulations contain different rules depending on the nature of the supply. For example, different rules apply to the supply of property and the supply of services. When applying these rules, one does not look at the constituent parts of the supply. The determination is made based upon what is supplied \u2013 is it property or a service?\n[153] The supply of electricity by the Local Distributors to their customers is deemed to have been made in Ontario under the rules applicable to the supply of property. It is not determined under the rules that apply to services such as transmission and delivery services.\n[154] Since the supply of the electricity is deemed to have been made in Ontario, it is subject to tax under subsection 165(2) at the 8% Ontario rate. The supply of the electricity is also subject to tax under subsection 165(1) at the 5% rate since the supply was made in Canada.[21] This is because it is a supply of property that was delivered in Canada. In summary, the supply of the electricity is taxed at the 13% Ontario HST rate.\n[155] When determining its net tax, the Appellant was required, under subsection 236.01(2), to add all of its specified provincial input tax credits.\n[156] As discussed previously, the definition of specified provincial input tax credit in subsection 236.01(1) refers to an input tax credit in respect of a specified property or service. Section 236.01 of the GST Act and section 26 and paragraph 28(1)(e) of the Recapture Regulations define specified property to include electricity.\n[157] Under subsection 225(1), an input tax credit does not arise until it is claimed by the person in that person\u2019s GST tax return. This means that the reference in the definition of specified provincial input tax credit to an input tax credit is a reference to an input tax credit that the Appellant claimed in its GST return.\n[158] As a result of these provisions, a specified provincial input tax credit of the Appellant, as that term is defined in subsection 236.01(1), is the portion of the input tax credit that the Appellant claimed in respect of the tax it paid at the 13% HST rate on the consideration for the single supply of electricity that is attributable to the 8% tax under subsection 165(2).\n[159] The Local Distributors made a single supply of electricity to the Appellant that was taxed at the 13% Ontario HST rate based upon the fact that the supply of electricity was deemed to have been made in Ontario. The Appellant did, in fact, claim an input tax credit for the tax that it paid at the 13% Ontario HST rate. It claimed such input tax credit on the basis that it acquired the electricity for consumption or use in its commercial activities.\n[160] The Appellant is required to recapture the portion of the input tax credit that it claimed relating to the 8% tax that it paid under subsection 165(2) in respect of the single supply of the electricity. There is no ambiguity in the legislation. In fact, the legislation is very straightforward. It looks to the input tax credit claimed in respect of the single supply. In the current appeal, the single supply was a supply of electricity. The fact that there were constituent parts of the supply is irrelevant.\n[161] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 12th day of April 2023.\n\u201cS.

D\u2019Arcy\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nApril 12, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nAlan Kenigsberg\nAl-Nawaz Nanji\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nJack Warren\nDominik Longchamps\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nAlan Kenigsberg Al-Nawaz Nanji\nFirm:\nOsler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP, Toronto, Ontario\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\nAPPENDIX A\nOral Reasons on Voir Dire\n[1] I will now rule on the admission of the Appellant\u2019s expert report.\n[2] Like all opinion evidence, expert opinion evidence is presumptively inadmissible. Opinion evidence refers to any inference from observed facts.\n[3] A properly qualified expert may provide opinion evidence to assist the trier of fact where his or her technical expertise is required to assist in drawing inferences.\n[4] The admissibility of expert opinion evidence is determined by the application of a two-stage test as confirmed in 2015 by the Supreme Court of Canada in White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.[22], which I will refer to as Inman.\n[5] The first step, the threshold stage, requires the parties putting the proposed expert forward to establish that the evidence satisfies the threshold requirements of admissibility. These requirements are the so-called four Mohan factors, and an additional requirement related to novel science, which is not an issue in this appeal.\n[6] At this first step, the evidence is assessed on a yes\/no basis, and if it falls short of any of the threshold preconditions, it should not be admitted. The Mohan factors are relevance, necessity in assisting the trier of fact, the absence of any exclusionary rule, and a properly qualified expert.\n[7] The second stage involves a discretionary weighing of the benefits or probative value of admitting evidence that meets the preconditions to admissibility as against the \u201ccosts\u201d of its admission, including considerations such as consumption of time, prejudice, and the risk of causing confusion.\n[8] The trial judge\u2019s gatekeeper function in relation to expert opinion evidence is important, bearing in mind that the parties have the right to put forward the most complete evidentiary record consistent with the rules of evidence.\n[9] As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in R. v. J.-L. J., 2000 SCC 51 at paragraphs 28 to 29:\nIn the course of Mohan and other judgments, the Court has emphasized that the trial judge should take seriously the role of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d. The admissibility of the expert evidence should be scrutinized at the time it is proffered and not allowed too easy an entry on the basis that all of the frailties could go at the end of the day to weight rather than admissibility. The Court\u2019s gatekeeper function must afford the parties the opportunity to put forward the most complete evidentiary record consistent with the rules of evidence. . .\n[10] With respect to the expert report put forward by the Appellant, the relevant Mohan factor is the necessity factor. In R. v. D (D.), 2000 SC 43, the Supreme Court of Canada noted:\n. . . When should we place the legal system and the truth at such risk by allowing expert evidence? Only when lay persons are apt to come to a wrong conclusion without expert assistance, or where access to important information will be lost unless we borrow from the learning of experts. As Mohan tells us, it is not enough that the expert evidence be helpful before we will be prepared to run these risks. That sets too low a standard. It must be necessary.\n[11] In short, helpfulness is not enough to allow for the admission of an expert report; it must be necessary.\n[12] Specifically, as noted in Mohan, the evidence must be reasonably necessary in the sense that it is likely outside of the ordinary experience and knowledge of the trier of fact. That can be found in R. v. Mohan, [1994], 2 SCR 9.\n[13] Further, the expert opinion evidence must be necessary to allow the trier of fact to:\n- appreciate the facts, due to their technical nature; or\n- form a correct judgment on a matter where ordinary persons are unlikely to do so without the help of those with special knowledge.\n[14] As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Mohan when adopting a statement made by Justice Dickson in R. v. Abbey, \u201c[i]f on the proven facts a judge and jury can form their own conclusion without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary\u201d. [23]\n[15] Now, the primary issue before the Court is the nature or components of the supplies made by the local electricity distribution companies to the Appellant.\n[16] The Appellant argues that the supply made to the Appellant included electricity within its meaning in the definition of specified energy in section 26 of Division 1, Part 6 of the New Harmonized Value-added Tax System Regulations, No. 2, plus other services or charges relating to the transmission or distribution of electricity or use of the electricity grid that do not constitute specified energy.\n[17] The Respondent argues that the Appellant received a single supply of specified energy.\n[18] The Appellant notes, in its pleading, that if the Court is required to consider whether there was a single or multiple supplies, then there were multiple supplies of electricity, distribution services, and the use of the electrical grid.\n[19] To address these issues, I need to determine, from a factual perspective, what, for the purposes of the GST Act, the distributors of electricity provided to the Appellant. This will require me to understand the involvement of the various players in the Ontario electricity market in the supply made by the local distributors to the Appellant, particularly, Ontario Power Generation, Hydro One, and the various local distributors.\n[20] I would expect such evidence to be provided to me by lay witnesses. This has not occurred. The only lay witness called by the Appellant was an employee of Bell Canada, whose testimony focused on how Bell powered its network and on the various invoices issued by the local distributors of electricity.\n[21] The Appellant now offers the expert report of Mr. John Todd. Mr. Todd is an expert with respect to electricity and the transmission and distribution of electricity in Canada, including in Ontario. His expertise is not an issue.\n[22] Mr. Todd states at page 8 of his report that he is providing his opinion on three sets of questions that were put to him by counsel for the Appellant. There are 10 questions in total.\n[23] The majority of the questions involve describing the electricity and distribution market in Ontario, including:\n-identifying who are the players in the market and how each of them participates in the market;\n-indicating whether electricity can be obtained separately from distribution and other regulated services;\n-can a company obtain electricity without distribution services;\n-can any distribution services be obtained without electricity;\n-what are the items listed on a local distribution company\u2019s invoice and how are the amounts determined;\n-are there situations where there are electricity charges, but no distribution, or regulation services, or vice versa.\n-does each of the amounts charged for distribution or other regulated services depend on the quantity of electricity purchased in a particular period. For instance, is it possible that more electricity can be purchased in one period than the next, but the fee for delivery and other regulated services remains the same, or decreases, or vice versa.\n[24] After reviewing Mr. Todd\u2019s report, I have concluded that it is not necessary. The majority of the report describes the Ontario energy market. Mr. Todd\u2019s answers to the questions do not contain facts that are of such a technical nature that I need help to appreciate the nature of such facts.\n[25] If I had a lay witness provide the various facts set out in Mr. Todd\u2019s report, I could have formed my own conclusion without the help of an expert. Specifically, witnesses from the various players in the Ontario market, particularly the Local Distributors that made the relevant supplies to the Appellant, could have easily provided this evidence. They each operate in a heavily regulated industry and certainly know what they can and cannot do and how the market operates.\n[26] If I had such evidence from the market participants, I could have formed a correct judgment without the help of an expert. The fact that the Appellant chose not to provide such lay evidence does not make the expert evidence necessary from the Court\u2019s perspective; it just makes it helpful to the Appellant.\n[27] Further, the majority of the report is composed of factual answers to the questions posed by the Appellant\u2019s counsel. It is difficult to see any opinion in Mr. Todd\u2019s answers to these questions. The only opinion I see is Mr. Todd\u2019s conclusion that, from the perspective of the industry in Ontario (counsel focused on the fact that this was from the perspective of the industry in Ontario), the term electricity refers to the energy that is created by the generators and is distinct from the delivery of electricity through the wires of the transmitters to distributors. This opinion would be of little help to the Court since I am concerned with what was, as a question of fact, supplied by the various local distributors to the Appellant.\n[28] Further, Mr. Todd\u2019s conclusion with respect to the term electricity represents a small portion of the report.\n[29] In my view, the primary purpose of Mr. Todd\u2019s report is to give fact evidence; it is not to give an opinion, an inference from the facts. I do not require an expert to tell me the facts.\n[30] As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in R. v. Parrott, 2001 SCC 3, at paragraph 55:\nThe special role of the expert witness is not to testify to the facts, but to provide an opinion based on the facts, to assist the trier of fact to draw the appropriate inferences from the facts as found \u201cwhich the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate\u201d (Abbey. . . at p. 42).\n[31] As I stated previously, what the Court needs is a lay witness to address the relevant factual issues, a witness whose fact evidence can be tested under cross\u2011examination.\n[32] For these reasons, I have concluded that the expert report is inadmissible.\n[1] S.O. 1998, C. 15, Sched.

Overview\n[1] The issue in these appeals is whether the Appellants, Len Little and Lucy Little, husband and wife, were properly assessed under subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act (Canada)[1] for unremitted GST\/HST owed by Lucy\u2019s Seafood Kitchen (Waterloo) Inc. (\u201cWaterloo\u201d) in the circumstances described hereinafter.\n[2] The appeals were heard on common evidence.\nII. Factual Background\n[3] The parties provided a partial agreed statement of facts. The Appellants admitted most of the factual assumptions relied on by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d), save for the factual assumptions that pertain to the registration of the certificate for the amount of $26,570.71 of Waterloo\u2019s alleged GST\/HST liability on June 22, 2015.\n[4] The Appellants also denied that execution for the amount of the certificate had been carried out, which is a precondition that must be satisfied for a director to be liable under subsection 323(1) of Part IX of the ETA.\n[5] The Respondent did not call any witnesses. The Respondent introduced all the relevant documents through affidavit evidence, which is how evidence is often introduced in appeals of assessments for director\u2019s liability under subsection 323(1) that are heard under the informal appeal.\n[6] Mr. and Ms. Little were called as witnesses in their appeals.\n[7] Mr. Little, the president and a director of Waterloo, acknowledged that he and his spouse were the only persons authorized to sign on Waterloo\u2019s bank account. Mr. Little acknowledged that he was responsible for ensuring that Waterloo complied with its reporting and collections obligations under the ETA.\n[8] Opened in 2004, Waterloo\u2019s restaurant business deteriorated rapidly after the financial crisis in 2008. Mr. Little testified that because of cash flow problems, Waterloo\u2019s tax returns were filed late. He claimed that his practise was to enclose multiple cheques with each return, some of which would be post\u2013dated.[2] Mr. Little testified that he would pay amounts using post\u2013dated cheques according to his own projections of sales in subsequent months. He adopted this practise because the corporation did not have enough funds on hand to pay the full amount of the HST shown on its returns.\n[9] Finally in March 2009, Waterloo ceased all operations.[3] Mr. Little acknowledged that he returned the keys to the landlord on that date and has not returned since. The inference that I draw from Mr. Little\u2019s testimony is that Waterloo had no assets that could have been disposed of when the certificate was issued by the Federal Court. Mr. Little also acknowledged that he did not retain any of Waterloo\u2019s financial, banking or tax records.\nIII. Position of the Parties\n[10] The Appellants submit that Waterloo had paid all of its net tax owed under the ETA prior to the closure of its restaurant business. The Appellants also allege that there is no evidence in the record to establish that execution of the amount of the certificate has been returned in whole or in part, which is a precondition for a director to be liable under subsection 323(1) of the ETA.\n[11] Unsurprisingly, the Respondent defends the contrary position.\nA. Is the amount of the certificate correct?\n[12] It is undisputed that a director has the right to challenge the underlying corporate liability in the case of a derivative assessment made under subsection 323(1) of the ETA. The Appellants have chosen to do so in the instant cases.\n[13] In cases where a director challenges an underlying corporate assessment, the burden of proof to demonstrate that an amount of tax was incorrectly assessed generally remains with the director. However, in certain circumstances, the taxpayer may be entitled to a shift of the burden of proof. In Mignardi,[4] Justice Paris held that the onus of proving the underlying tax liability will shift to the Minister in the somewhat unusual situation where the \u201cfacts concerning the underlying tax debt are exclusively or peculiarly within the knowledge of the Minister\u201d.[5]\n[14] Mr. Little acknowledged that he was responsible for ensuring that Waterloo satisfied its reporting and tax obligations under the ETA. The Waterloo tax returns were prepared by Waterloo\u2019s external tax advisor based on information provided by Mr. Little. Mr. Little would then arrange for payment based on Waterloo\u2019s ability to pay at any given time. Mr. Little acknowledged that Waterloo was often in arrears in remitting the net tax owed under the ETA.\n[15] Because Mr. Little did not retain Waterloo\u2019s books and records, no documentary evidence was submitted to demonstrate that the amount of the certificate was incorrect.\n[16] In contrast, the Respondent produced copies of all of Waterloo\u2019s assessments for the relevant period. The returns were assessed as filed.\n[17] Furthermore, the documentary evidence shows that the corporation\u2019s tax installments were applied first to amounts owing in arrears.\n[18] Considering the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that Waterloo had an outstanding liability under the ETA in the amount of $26,570.71 when the certificate was issued on June 22, 2015.\nB. Inability to recover from Waterloo\n[19] Paragraph 323(2)(a) of the ETA requires the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) to demonstrate its inability to recover the amounts at issue directly from the corporation. A director is not liable unless the following precondition provided for in paragraph 323(2)(a) of the ETA is satisfied:\n(a) a certificate for the amount of the corporation\u2019s liability referred to in that subsection has been registered in the Federal Court under section 316 and execution for that amount has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;\n[20] In Barrett,[6]the FCA held that the CRA as a creditor is not required to show that it made reasonable efforts to collect the debt, but must simply show that it acted in good faith to collect without ulterior or improper motive.\n[21] Section 316 of the ETA, which is referenced in paragraph 323(2)(a), provides for how the Minister may certify the amount of an indebtedness owing under the ETA and then register the certificate in the Federal Court. Once the certificate is registered, it has the same effect as a judgment obtained in the Federal Court against the debtor and can be enforced as such.\nC. Execution of the certificate returned unsatisfied\n[22] The parties submit that the Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that execution of the certificate has been returned unsatisfied. The Appellants argue that there is no evidence in the record to show that this has been done.\n[23] Subsection 335(5) provides for a simplified process that allows the CRA to introduce a variety of documents through affidavit evidence. The provision reads as follows:\nProof of documents\n(5) An affidavit of an officer of the Canada Revenue Agency, sworn before a commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, setting out that the officer has charge of the appropriate records and that a document annexed to the affidavit is a document or true copy of a document, or a print\u2011out of an electronic document, made by or on behalf of the Minister or a person exercising the powers of the Minister or by or on behalf of a person, is evidence of the nature and contents of the document.\n[24] The Appellants submit that the writ of seizure and the levy report that were introduced through affidavit evidence are inadmissible under subsection 335(5) because these documents, copies of which were in the CRA records, are not documents made by persons acting on behalf of the Minister. According to the Respondent, any documents made by the CRA are admissible under this provision. The levy report and writ of seizure are not documents that originate from the CRA.\n[25] I disagree with the Appellants\u2019 interpretation of subsection 335(5). The provision applies to a document that is \u201cmade by or on behalf of the Minister or a person exercising the powers of the Minister or by or on behalf of a person\u201d (emphasis added). The last reference extends to persons who make documents that are filed with the CRA under the ETA. Subsection 335(5) includes, in my opinion, proof of any document in the CRA\u2019s files, including documents received by a registrant.\n[26] The term \u201cdocument\u201d which is used in subsection 335(5), is defined in subsection 123(1) to include a record. A \u201crecord\u201d is defined in subsection 123(1) to include any information whether in writing or in any other form. The levy report, the certificate and the writ of seizure are all electronic copies of documents found in the CRA records.\n[27] If I am wrong and these documents are inadmissible under subsection 335(5) I am nonetheless satisfied that execution of the writ of seizure has been returned unsatisfied. Mr. Little acknowledged during his testimony that two officers of the sheriff\u2019s office turned up at his home asking questions about Waterloo. He also acknowledged that Waterloo stopped its operations long ago and that it vacated the premises that it operated under the landlord.\n[28] Exhibit \u201cF\u201d to the affidavit is a copy of a letter addressed to the sheriff\u2019s office that executed the writ of seizure. The letter was prepared by Mr. Stevenson, a collections officer with the CRA. The letter indicates that the corporation had stopped all active business operations and instructs the sheriff to attempt execution at Mr. Little\u2019s residence.\n[29] Mr. Little stated that he was intimidated when the two officers of the sheriff\u2019s office showed up at his home, and he could not recall all that was discussed. I am satisfied by this additional evidence that execution was returned for the amount of the certificate and that it was returned unsatisfied.\n[30] A final observation is merited here. These appeals were heard under the informal procedure. Subsection 18.15(3) of the Tax Court of Canada Act[7] provides that \u201cthe Court is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting a hearing and the appeal shall be dealt with by the Court as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit.\u201d\n[31] There is no question in my mind that the Appellants know that execution of the certificate has been returned unsatisfied. The Appellants have suffered no prejudice from the Respondent\u2019s decision to prove that execution had been issued through documentary evidence. Nothing would be gained if the officers who executed the writ of seizure at the Appellants\u2019 home were to be called to testify that execution had been issued as required under paragraph 333(2)(a).\n[32] Considering the evidence as a whole, the Respondent has established that execution for Waterloo\u2019s HST debt had taken place prior to the issuance of the assessments at issue herein. Therefore, the precondition provided for in paragraph 323(2)(a) has been satisfied.\nIV. Conclusion\n[33] Considering the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the assessments have been validly issued under subsection 323(1) of the ETA. For these reasons, the Appellants\u2019 appeals are dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of April 2023.\n\u201cRobert J.

BREEN,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nHill J.\nI. Introduction [1] In 2018, Dr. Jonathon Breen and his wife incurred various expenses when they moved from their two-storey, 100-year-old home to a single-storey, grade-level home that could accommodate the increasing limitations of his mobility disability.\n[2] The Minister of National Revenue allowed Dr. Breen\u2019s claim for the medical expense tax credit for expenses related to that new home purchase. However, she denied the claim for a property transfer tax payment expense because of the $2,000 limit on the amount that can be claimed for moving expenses under paragraph 118.2(2)(l.5) of the Income Tax Act. The Minister also determined that Dr. Breen did not qualify for the moving expense deduction under section 62 because he did not move 40 kilometres closer to a new work or school location.\n[3] Dr. Breen acknowledged that these statutory limitations apply in his case. His primary argument is that the provisions at issue violate his equality rights under subsection 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because they are under-inclusive, leading to adverse impact discrimination on the ground of disability.\n[4] Despite Dr. Breen\u2019s thorough and thoughtful submissions, this argument cannot succeed. There is no discrimination within the meaning of subsection 15(1) of the Charter because there is no distinction based on disability, either directly or indirectly. The provisions at issue apply to all taxpayers based on their specific, individual circumstances. Parliament is not required to provide tax benefits that meet the needs of all taxpayers.\n[5] In the present case, Dr. Breen qualified for the medical expense tax credit for moving expenses because of his disability, but he was subject to the $2,000 limit imposed by Parliament. His disability otherwise was not an impediment to claiming the moving expense deduction under section 62 of the Income Tax Act because he would have qualified for the deduction if he had moved 40 kilometres closer to a new job.\nII. Background \u2013 The medical expense claims [6] Dr. Breen and his wife claimed the medical expense tax credit for expenses related to his mobility disability arising from conditions that existed, and have deteriorated, since he contracted polio as a child.[1]\n[7] The Minister determined that the Breens had eligible medical expenses of $31,598.01, including renovations of $26,281.90 to their new home, and $2,000 for moving expenses related to moving supplies and the cost of a moving company.[2]\n[8] The allowed moving expenses did not include a property transfer tax payment of $17,600 on the purchase of the new home (\u201cPTT payment\u201d). Dr. Breen claimed $8,096 of the PTT payment and his wife claimed the remaining $9,504.\n[9] The Minister denied the PTT payment expense on the basis that the $2,000 limit for moving expenses under paragraph 118.2(2)(l.5) of the Income Tax Act had already been reached.[3]\n[10] The Minister also determined that Dr. Breen could not claim the PTT payment as a moving expense deduction under section 62 because his new house was not 40 kilometres closer to a new place of employment or business, as required by the definition of an \u201celigible relocation\u201d in subsection 248(1).[4]\n[11] The Minister also disallowed Dr. Breen\u2019s medical expense tax credit claim for heating pads and wheelchair gloves.[5]\n[12] In written submissions filed after the hearing, the Respondent conceded that the wheelchair gloves qualify as a medical expense pursuant to paragraph 118.2(2)(i), on the basis that Dr. Breen uses the gloves in respect of a listed medical device, specifically his wheelchair.[6] Indeed, Dr. Breen testified that while the gloves are not specifically \u201cwheelchair gloves\u201d, he purchases and uses rappelling gloves to protect his hands and for using his wheelchair in the winter and other difficult conditions.\n[13] The Respondent otherwise maintains that the heating pads expense does not qualify for the medical expense tax credit because they are neither a device, nor used in respect of a device, listed in paragraph 118.2(2)(i).[7]\n[14] As a result, the only amounts at issue are the PTT payment expense and the heating pads expense.\n[15] Dr. Breen testified in support of his appeal. I do not doubt his credibility, sincerity, or his expertise in attitudinal and employment issues related to people with disabilities. However, his appeal turns on the application of various provisions of the Income Tax Act and legal principles with respect to how the Charter applies to those provisions.\nIII. Analysis [16] Dr. Breen agreed that he cannot claim the PTT payment because he has already reached the $2,000 limit for moving expenses for the medical expense tax credit. He also agreed that he otherwise does not meet the 40-kilometre distance requirement for the moving expense deduction.\n[17] Dr. Breen argued that the medical expense tax credit and moving expense deduction provisions infringe his right to equality under subsection 15(1) of the Charter. He stated that inadvertent discrimination has occurred because Parliament failed to consider the needs and circumstances of people with disabilities.\n[18] Subsection 15(1) of the Charter prohibits discrimination as follows:\nEquality before and under law and equal protection and benefit of law\n15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n[19] As established by the Federal Court of Appeal, if there is no discrimination within the meaning of this provision, a court does not need to conduct a section 15 analysis.[8]\n[20] This threshold determination is based on the principle that discrimination will not result from every distinction or difference in treatment.[9] The Income Tax Act makes distinctions through various statutory requirements, in an attempt to generate government revenue while balancing various economic and social policies.[10] In this context, the right to the equal benefit of the law does not mean that each taxpayer has an equal right to receive the same amounts, deductions, or benefits.[11]\n[21] This Court has applied these principles to conclude that various benefit provisions under the Income Tax Act do not engage subsection 15(1) of the Charter because they do not discriminate on the basis of any of the enumerated grounds. Rather, the statutory requirements apply to all taxpayers.\n[22] As outlined below, Dr. Breen\u2019s appeal cannot be distinguished from these previous decisions.\nA. Dr. Breen\u2019s inability to claim the PTT payment as a medical expense does not constitute discrimination [23] Dr. Breen argued that the medical expense tax credit scheme violates subsection 15(1) because it does not provide a proper category for which the PTT payment could be claimed. He based this argument on the proposition that the PTT payment is not a moving expense, but rather part of the purchase of the new residence. If the payment had not been made, the purchase of the property could not have been completed.\n[24] Dr. Breen submitted that the violation of his equality rights occurred by inadvertent omission, when Parliament failed to provide an additional medical expense tax credit category for the purchase of a home. Paragraphs 118.2(2)(l.2) and 118.2(2)(l.21) provide credits for renovations and for home construction costs, respectively.\n[25] In Dr. Breen\u2019s case, financial constraints prevented him from renovating his 100-year-old Arts and Crafts home or from building a new home. The most viable option was to buy another home. Dr. Breen stated that Parliament failed to consider this third, reasonable and affordable option that may be more suitable for an individual\u2019s particular disability.\n[26] This position does not assist Dr. Breen because, even if I accept that what he is proposing is not already covered in the moving expense category, he is seeking a benefit that is not provided to anyone under the Income Tax Act.\n[27] Relying on Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, the Federal Court of Appeal in Ali held that subsection 15(1) of the Charter will not be infringed if the benefit sought is not provided by the law being challenged.[12] In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the medical expense tax credit is not discriminatory if no taxpayer is permitted to claim the cost of dietary supplements. The exclusion of these supplements is not discriminatory in effect because it is fully consistent with the purpose and scheme of the legislation, which is to only provide the medical expense tax credit in respect of specifically enumerated types of medical expenses.[13] Not all types of medical expenses qualify.\n[28] In Chevalier, this Court held that there was no discrimination with respect to a taxpayer\u2019s inability to claim the medical expense tax credit for vitamins, organic food, supplements, and osteopathic services to treat fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.[14] Eligibility was based on the product or service purchased, not on the type of disability from which a taxpayer suffers.[15]\n[29] The following paragraph from Chevalier applies in the present case:[16]\nAs mentioned previously, the medical expense tax credit, being a large-scale benefit program, cannot take into account every taxpayer\u2019s needs. Furthermore, there is no legal requirement that it do so. I agree that subsection 118.2(2) of the Act does not allow the Appellant to deduct all medical expenses that relate to her individual needs. However, this was never the intended purpose of subsection 118.2(2) of the Act. Also, the said provision does not exclude the Appellant on the basis of personal traits or circumstances; it is not arbitrary, but, rather, it applies equally to all taxpayers. Many taxpayers suffering from various types of illnesses seek alternative medical treatment, thus it cannot be said that the legislation draws a line based on physical characteristics. The government simply had to define the scope of subsection 118.2(2); it did so on the basis of the type of medical services and products. Consequently, the needs of the Appellant have been taken into account by the government, since she qualifies for some tax relief under that subsection.\n[30] Dr. Breen\u2019s challenge similarly cannot succeed because no taxpayer is permitted to claim the medical expense tax credit for the purchase of a new residence, except for those expenses that fall under the existing categories in subsection 118.2(2) of the Income Tax Act.\n[31] Although Dr. Breen\u2019s primary Charter arguments were not directed at the $2,000 limit in paragraph 118.2(2)(l.5), the same principles apply.\n[32] In Keehn, this Court determined that the 80-kilometre distance requirement in paragraph 118.2(2)(h) does not violate subsection 15(1) of the Charter because it applies equally to all individuals seeking to claim a medical expense tax credit for travel expenses to obtain medical services.[17] While the provision allows for travel expenses for medical purposes, Parliament has imposed a specific distance criteria, limiting the tax relief to individuals who have to travel more than 80 kilometres. This Court held that the distance criteria is not based on differences between individuals themselves.[18]\n[33] The $2,000 limit for moving expenses under paragraph 118.2(2)(l.5) similarly has general application:\n118.2(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a medical expense of an individual is an amount paid\n[\u2026]\n(l.5) for reasonable moving expenses (within the meaning of subsection 62(3), but not including any expense deducted under section 62 for any taxation year) of the patient, who lacks normal physical development or has a severe and prolonged mobility impairment, incurred for the purpose of the patient\u2019s move to a dwelling that is more accessible by the patient or in which the patient is more mobile or functional, if the total of the expenses claimed under this paragraph by all persons in respect of the move does not exceed $2,000;\n[34] Notably, only individuals who lack \u201cnormal physical development\u201d or have a \u201csevere and prolonged mobility impairment\u201d qualify for this expense.[19] The $2,000 limit does not otherwise systematically exclude taxpayers on the basis of disability.\nB. The moving expense deduction criteria do not constitute discrimination [35] Dr. Breen also argued that the requirements to claim the moving expense deduction under section 62 of the Income Tax Act constitute systemic discrimination because they do not take into account the realities of people with mobility disabilities. He believes that valid reasons for relocation that are specific to disability were not considered when Parliament imposed the 40-kilometre distance requirement.\n[36] The criteria at issue are found in the definition of an \u201celigible relocation\u201d in subsection 248(1):\neligible relocation means a relocation of a taxpayer in respect of which the following apply:\n(a) the relocation occurs to enable the taxpayer\n(i) to carry on a business or to be employed at a location (in section 62 and this definition referred to as \u201cthe new work location\u201d) that is, except if the taxpayer is absent from but resident in Canada, in Canada, or\n(ii) to be a student in full-time attendance enrolled in a program at a post-secondary level at a location of a university, college or other educational institution (in section 62 and this definition referred to as \u201cthe new work location\u201d),\n(b) the taxpayer ordinarily resided before the relocation at a residence (in section 62 and this definition referred to as \u201cthe old residence\u201d) and ordinarily resided after the relocation at a residence (in section 62 and this definition referred to as \u201cthe new residence\u201d),\n(c) except if the taxpayer is absent from but resident in Canada, both the old residence and the new residence are in Canada, and\n(d) the distance between the old residence and the new work location is not less than 40 kilometres greater than the distance between the new residence and the new work location;\n[37] In considering the purpose and effect of this definition, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that an employee may have to move in order to remain within a practical commuting distance of a new job.[20] The Federal Court of Appeal also recognized that Parliament limited the deduction to moves that bring a taxpayer at least 40 kilometres closer to the new work or school location, in order to prevent the provision from being invoked when a taxpayer simply desires a change in residence.[21]\n[38] Dr. Breen takes issue with this distance requirement on the basis that there is no consideration of whether 40 kilometres is an appropriate distance. He stated that people with disabilities may encounter difficulties that are not connected to distance, such as the time it may take to travel between locations and access to appropriate transportation services. In overlooking this consideration, Parliament indirectly discriminated against individuals with disabilities.\n[39] However, Dr. Breen\u2019s failure to qualify for the deduction was not based on his disability, but on the particular facts of his case. There was no new work or school location. In 2018, Dr. Breen was a full-time PhD student at the University of British Columbia, had casual employment conducting research and policy development for the university, and operated a consulting firm, Breen and Associates, with a focus on social policy and disability and employment. The move to the new home assisted Dr. Breen in his ability to work from home for his existing studies, employment, and business activities.\n[40] Dr. Breen also did not meet the distance requirement because his new home is only 13 kilometres closer to the University of British Columbia.\n[41] There was no distinction within the meaning of subsection 15(1) of the Charter. All taxpayers are subject to the same requirements, based on their individual, factual circumstances.[22]\n[42] Dr. Breen\u2019s position also disregards the tax benefit schemes within the Income Tax Act intended to assist taxpayers with disabilities. In the present case, the medical expense tax credit provisions provided Dr. Breen with some, but not complete relief for various medical expenses he incurred.[23]\nC. The heating pads expense does not qualify for the medical expense tax credit [43] Dr. Breen testified that he uses the heating pads to assist with blood circulation problems caused by the temperature dysregulation associated with polio. It is a form of self-administered treatment for his continued polio symptoms.\n[44] While I do not doubt Dr. Breen\u2019s basis for their use, the heating pads do not qualify for the medical expense tax credit. They are not a device, or used in respect of a device, listed in paragraph 118.2(2)(i). They also do not qualify under paragraph 118.2(2)(m) because they are not a device or equipment listed in the applicable regulation.[24]\n[45] This Court reached a similar conclusion in Ross, where that taxpayer attempted to claim the medical expense tax credit for the cost of heating pads and other treatment supplies.[25]\n[46] Parliament intended to limit the availability of the medical expense tax credit to a specific list of items and types of expenses.[26] In this regard, the heating pads do not qualify under any of the statutory categories.\nIV. Conclusion [47] Dr. Breen is an effective and moving advocate for people with disabilities. His expertise and breadth of knowledge are undeniable.\n[48] However, his Charter arguments fail because none of the provisions at issue systematically exclude persons with a disability in general, or those in a specific subset of that group. To the contrary, certain provisions of the medical expense tax credit are specifically directed at individuals with severe and prolonged mobility impairment. The credits and deductions provided under the Income Tax Act cannot address the circumstances of every taxpayer.\n[49] Dr. Breen qualified for the maximum amount provided under paragraph 118.2(2)(1.5), the medical expense category Parliament intended to capture moving expense payments like the PTT. There is no basis for this Court to extend the provision beyond Parliament\u2019s clear intention. As this Court stated in Johnston, it is Parliament\u2019s job to set limits for the establishment and ongoing delivery of social programs and this Court cannot \u201csubstitute its judgment for where such lines should be drawn or redrawn.\u201d[27]\n[50] The appeal is therefore allowed only with respect to the wheelchair glove expense conceded by the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 14th day of April 2023.\n\u201cJoanna Hill\u201d\nHill J.\nAppendix \u201cA\u201d\nMedical expenses\n118.2(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a medical expense of an individual is an amount paid\n[\u2026]\n(i) for, or in respect of, an artificial limb, an iron lung, a rocking bed for poliomyelitis victims, a wheel chair, crutches, a spinal brace, a brace for a limb, an ileostomy or colostomy pad, a truss for hernia, an artificial eye, a laryngeal speaking aid, an aid to hearing, an artificial kidney machine, phototherapy equipment for the treatment of psoriasis or other skin disorders, or an oxygen concentrator, for the patient;\n[\u2026]\n(l.2) for reasonable expenses relating to renovations or alterations to a dwelling of the patient who lacks normal physical development or has a severe and prolonged mobility impairment, to enable the patient to gain access to, or to be mobile or functional within, the dwelling, provided that such expenses\n(i) are not of a type that would typically be expected to increase the value of the dwelling, and\n(ii) are of a type that would not normally be incurred by persons who have normal physical development or who do not have a severe and prolonged mobility impairment;\n(l.21) for reasonable expenses relating to the construction of the principal place of residence of the patient who lacks normal physical development or has a severe and prolonged mobility impairment, that can reasonably be considered to be incremental costs incurred to enable the patient to gain access to, or to be mobile or functional within, the patient\u2019s principal place of residence, provided that such expenses\n(i) are not of a type that would typically be expected to increase the value of the dwelling, and\n(ii) are of a type that would not normally be incurred by persons who have normal physical development or who do not have a severe and prolonged mobility impairment;\n[\u2026]\n(l.5) for reasonable moving expenses (within the meaning of subsection 62(3), but not including any expense deducted under section 62 for any taxation year) of the patient, who lacks normal physical development or has a severe and prolonged mobility impairment, incurred for the purpose of the patient\u2019s move to a dwelling that is more accessible by the patient or in which the patient is more mobile or functional, if the total of the expenses claimed under this paragraph by all persons in respect of the move does not exceed $2,000;\n[\u2026]\n(m) for any device or equipment for use by the patient that\n(i) is of a prescribed kind,\n(ii) is prescribed by a medical practitioner,\n(iii) is not described in any other paragraph of this subsection, and\n(iv) meets such conditions as are prescribed as to its use or the reason for its acquisition;\nto the extent that the amount so paid does not exceed the amount, if any, prescribed in respect of the device or equipment;\nMoving expenses\n62 (1) There may be deducted in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year amounts paid by the taxpayer as or on account of moving expenses incurred in respect of an eligible relocation, to the extent that\n(a) they were not paid on the taxpayer\u2019s behalf in respect of, in the course of or because of, the taxpayer\u2019s office or employment;\n(b) they were not deductible because of this section in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the preceding taxation year;\n(c) the total of those amounts does not exceed\n(i) in any case described in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition eligible relocation in subsection 248(1), the total of all amounts, each of which is an amount included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the taxation year from the taxpayer\u2019s employment at a new work location or from carrying on the business at the new work location, or because of subparagraph 56(1)(r)(v) in respect of the taxpayer\u2019s employment at the new work location, and\n(ii) in any case described in subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition eligible relocation in subsection 248(1), the total of amounts included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year because of paragraphs 56(1)(n) and (o);

INTRODUCTION\n[1] These Reasons pertain to Notices of Motion filed by the three Appellants on September 24, 2021. The Appellants\u2019 Motions are each for an Order to strike out some or all of the Respondent\u2019s Replies.[1] While the Notices of Motion did not contain a written request that the Motions be disposed of upon consideration of written representations and without appearance by the parties, and while no separate written request to such effect was filed, as contemplated by section 69 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d), it seems to have been the intent of the statement in paragraph 1 of each Notice of Motion that the Appellants would make motions in writing, particularly as each Notice of Motion contained summaries of the facts and relevant legal provisions, as well as the Appellants\u2019 submissions concerning the application of those provisions to the Respondent\u2019s Replies. That intent seems to have been understood by the Respondent, who filed written representations, on October 26, 2021, in response to the Appellants\u2019 Motions.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts [2] Based on the Notices of Appeal filed by the Appellants, each of the Appellants:\n(a) lives in or near Ottawa, Ontario or Gatineau, Quebec;\n(b) is an experienced wine collector;\n(c) during each of the taxation years that are the subject of the respective Appeals, donated bottles of wine to registered charities and received an official receipt (as defined in section 3500 of the Income Tax Regulations)[2] in respect of each charitable donation; and\n(d) filed his official receipts with the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) in support of a deduction of tax credits under subsection 118.1(3) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d).[3]\n[3] Some of the wines that were the subject of the charitable donations had been appraised by Nico van Duyvenbode, while other wines were appraised by other appraisers.\n[4] In reassessing the Appellants, the Minister took the position that the fair market value of the wines appraised by Mr. van Duyvenbode was equal to only 20% of the amounts shown on the applicable official receipts.\nB. Procedural History 1. Irving Ebert [5] By Notices of Reassessment dated June 5, 2009, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by the Appellant Irving Ebert for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxation years. By Notices of Reassessment dated February 24, 2012, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by Mr. Ebert for the 2008 and 2009 taxation years. By Notice of Reassessment dated February 28, 2013, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by Mr. Ebert for the 2011 taxation year. By Notice of Reassessment dated August 26, 2013, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by Mr. Ebert for the 2012 taxation year. By Notice of Reassessment dated October 9, 2014, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by Mr. Ebert for the 2013 taxation year.\n[6] Mr. Ebert filed Notices of Objection in respect of each of the Reassessments. The Minister confirmed the 2011 Reassessment on December 11, 2019 and the remaining Reassessments on December 13, 2019.\n[7] Mr. Ebert filed a Notice of Appeal on March 10, 2020, an Amended Notice of Appeal on September 28, 2020, and a Fresh as Amended Notice of Appeal on October 7, 2020.\n[8] The Respondent filed a Reply to the Amended Notice of Appeal on November 30, 2020 and an Amended Reply (the \u201cEbert Reply\u201d) to the Amended Notice of Appeal on March 5, 2021.\n[9] Mr. Ebert\u2019s Motion was commenced by a Notice of Motion filed on September 24, 2021. The Notice of Motion implied that Mr. Ebert desired that the Motion be disposed of upon consideration of written representations, which were included in the Notice of Motion. The Respondent filed written representations on October 26, 2021 in respect of Mr. Ebert\u2019s Motion, as well as in respect of the Motions of the other two Appellants.\n2. Richard Herman [10] By Notices of Reassessment dated June 5, 2009, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by the Appellant Richard Herman for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 taxation years. Mr. Herman objected to the Reassessments. The Minister confirmed the Reassessments on February 25, 2020.\n[11] Mr. Herman filed a Notice of Appeal on May 26, 2020. The Respondent filed a Reply (the \u201cHerman Reply\u201d) on November 12, 2020.\n[12] Mr. Herman\u2019s Motion was commenced by a Notice of Motion filed on September 24, 2021. The Notice of Motion implied that Mr. Herman desired that the Motion be disposed of upon consideration of written representations, which were included in the Notice of Motion. The Respondent filed written representations on October 26, 2021 in respect of Mr. Herman\u2019s Motion, as well as in respect of the Motions of the other two Appellants.\n3. P. Philippe DesRosiers [13] By Notices of Reassessment dated May 8, 2009, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by the Appellant P. Philippe DesRosiers for the 2005 and 2006 taxation years. By Notices of Reassessment dated January 5, 2012, the Minister reassessed the tax payable by Mr. DesRosiers for the 2008 and 2009 taxation years. Mr. DesRosiers filed Notices of Objection in respect of each of the Reassessments. By Notice of Confirmation dated January 29, 2020, the Minister confirmed the Reassessments in respect of Mr. DesRosiers.\n[14] Mr. DesRosiers filed a Notice of Appeal on October 20, 2020, and an Amended Notice of Appeal and a Fresh as Amended Notice of Appeal on December 2, 2020. The Respondent filed a Reply (the \u201cDesRosiers Reply\u201d) to the Amended Notice of Appeal on February 24, 2021.\n[15] Mr. DesRosiers\u2019s Motion was commenced by a Notice of Motion filed on September 24, 2021. The Notice of Motion implied that Mr. DesRosiers desired that the Motion be disposed of upon consideration of written representations, which were included in the Notice of Motion. The Respondent filed written representations on October 26, 2021 in respect of Mr. DesRosiers\u2019s Motion, as well as in respect of the Motions of the other two Appellants.\n4. Impugned Assumptions [16] In addition to various assumptions that are specific to the three Appellants respectively, the Ebert Reply, the Herman Reply and the DesRosiers Reply (collectively, the \u201cReplies\u201d) each contain a series of subparagraphs setting out the same ten assumptions of fact that were made by the Minister in determining the particular Appellant\u2019s tax liability for the taxation years in issue. As well, the Minister made one additional assumption of fact in determining the tax liability of Mr. Ebert. By means of the Notices of Motion, the Appellants have applied to the Court for Orders to strike out the above-mentioned 11 assumptions of fact (collectively, the \u201cImpugned Assumptions\u201d). Each of the Impugned Assumptions will be discussed below.\nIII. ISSUES [17] In general terms, the issues raised by these Motions are the following:\n(a) should some or all of the Impugned Assumptions be struck out because they lack precision and accuracy?\n(b) should some or all of the Impugned Assumptions be struck out because they are irrelevant?\n(c) should some or all of the Impugned Assumptions be struck out because they pertain to third parties or other taxpayers?\n(d) should some or all of the Impugned Assumptions be struck out because they pertain to transactions in taxation years preceding those that are in issue in these Appeals?\nIV. LEGAL PRINCIPLES A. Rule 53\n[18] Subsection 53(1) of the Rules states:\n(1) The Court may, on its own initiative or on application by a party, strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document\n(a) may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal;\n(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;\n(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court; or\n(d) discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal or opposing the appeal.\nB. Motion to Strike\n[19] With respect to the applicable test on a motion to strike for not disclosing reasonable grounds for advancing or opposing an appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated the following in Imperial Tobacco:\nA claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u2026. Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial.[4]\n[20] Some of the general principles applicable to an application to strike out a pleading under section 53 of the Rules were summarized by Chief Justice Bowman in Sentinel Hill, as follows:\nI shall begin by outlining what I believe are the principles to be applied on a motion to strike under Rule 53. There are many cases in which the matter has been considered both in this court and the Federal Court of Appeal. It is not necessary to quote from them all as the principles are well established.\n(a) The facts as alleged in the impugned pleading must be taken as true subject to the limitations stated in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. Canada, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at 455. It is not open to a party attacking a pleading under Rule 53 to challenge assertions of fact.\n(b) To strike out a pleading or part of a pleading under Rule 53 it must be plain and obvious that the position has no hope of succeeding. The test is a stringent one and the power to strike out a pleading must be exercised with great care.\n(c) A motions judge should avoid usurping the function of the trial judge in making determinations of fact or relevancy. Such matters should be left to the judge who hears the evidence.[5] [Footnote omitted.]\n[21] The Appellants take the position that the Impugned Assumptions are:\n(a) imprecise or inaccurate,\n(b) irrelevant, or\n(c) relate to the treatment of taxpayers other than the Appellants.\n[22] I will summarize the legal principles in respect of each of the above three arguments below.\nC. Precision and Accuracy [23] Concerning the requirement that precise and accurate assumptions of fact be pleaded, the Federal Court of Appeal stated the following in Anchor Pointe:\nThe pleading of assumptions gives the Crown the powerful tool of shifting the onus to the taxpayer to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions. The facts pleaded as assumptions must be precise and accurate so that the taxpayer knows exactly the case it has to meet. There is no reason why the requirement for precision and accuracy does not apply to the Crown accurately stating the circumstances in which the assumptions arose, that is, on an assessment, reassessment or confirmation.[6]\nD. Relevance [24] The general principle is that the determination of whether an assumption of fact by the Minister is relevant or irrelevant is better determined by the trial judge than by a motions judge. For instance, in Mungovan, Associate Chief Justice Bowman (as he then was) stated:\nIt is entirely possible \u2026 that some of the impugned assumptions are irrelevant. This is a matter for the trial judge to determine after the evidence has been presented. It is not a matter that can or should be determined on a preliminary motion to strike. It may well be that the paragraphs contain allegations that lie exclusively within the respondent\u2019s knowledge. It is a matter for the trial judge to determine whether the onus should be cast upon the respondent to establish them.[7]\nIn concluding the reasons for his decision in Mungovan, not to strike out the impugned assumptions of fact, Associate Chief Justice Bowman stated:\nI do not think that the pleaded assumptions to which the appellant takes exception are scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious. They may be irrelevant or wrong but, unless the evidence at trial discloses otherwise, they remain nonetheless to be treated as the assumptions on which the Minister acted.[8]\n[25] Four years later, in the Gould case, Chief Justice Bowman (as he then was) reiterated the point that he had made previously. In Gould, he stated:\nGenerally speaking, the striking out of portions of a pleading under section 53 of the Rules should be reserved for only the most plain and obvious cases. Matters of weight and relevancy are best determined by the trial judge who will have heard all of the evidence.[9]\n[26] In Metrobec, Justice D\u2019Auray, after considering many of the authorities dealing with assumptions of fact that are allegedly irrelevant, stated:\n\u2026 a paragraph or part of a paragraph will only be struck out from a pleading if it is plain and obvious that the alleged facts disclose no reasonable cause of action. When in doubt, it is best to leave the determination of the relevancy of the facts to the trial judge, who, unlike the judge presiding over the motion, will have access to all of the evidence.[10]\n[27] Justice Rip (as he then was) was even more direct when he stated the following in Status-One in 2004:\n\u2026 this Court has stated on several occasions that the question of whether a pleading should be struck out in whole or in part is one for the trial judge to determine, and is not [a] matter to be determined in an interlocutory motion\u2026. The trial judge is in a far better position than a judge hearing a preliminary motion to consider which assumptions of fact, if any, should be stuck [sic] out. It is up to the trial judge to decide what is relevant and what is not.[11]\nE. Assumptions Concerning Other Taxpayers [28] Concerning the question of whether the Minister may plead assumptions of fact that pertain to other taxpayers or third parties, counsel for the Appellants referred me to Sinclair, where Justice Bowie stated that the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal (the \u201cFCA\u201d) in Ludco Enterprises confirmed that, on an appeal from an assessment of income tax, evidence is not admissible to show that other taxpayers have been assessed more favourably in identical circumstances, and where Justice Bowie also noted that the decision of the FCA in Hokhold indicated that the Minister\u2019s different treatment of taxpayers in similar circumstances is not the basis for an appeal. Justice Bowie observed that the FCA, in striking out part of a notice of appeal, had noted that invidious consequences would arise if the trial of a particular issue were to become an inquiry into the tax treatment of persons who were not parties to the appeal before the Court.[12]\n[29] Concerning the same issue, counsel for the Respondent referred me to the 2005 decision in Status-One, where Justice Rip (as he then was) stated that \u201cthere may be appeals in which the activities, past and present, of third parties may be relevant to the actions of a taxpayer.\u201d[13] In making that statement, Justice Rip was referring to a comment that he had made in a previous decision, which dealt with an earlier motion made in respect of the same appeal,[14] and which was upheld by the FCA, which stated:\nAs Mr. Justice Rip indicates, in some cases, it is quite possible that relationships or ties between an appellant and third parties will be relevant to the determination of its tax payable. But it is still necessary for the pleadings to indicate precisely how those ties or relationships could serve that purpose.[15]\n[30] In Gould, Chief Justice Bowman noted that in some situations (particularly charitable donation arrangements), a central component of an assessment might be the existence of a scheme, which, of necessity, involves third parties, such that, \u201cif the existence of a scheme is essential to the Crown\u2019s case[,] it should be able to plead and prove all of the components of the scheme.\u201d[16] Chief Justice Bowman then went on to say:\nTo say, as the appellant does, that Global and Status-One preclude any reference to third party transactions unless the appellant knows of or is privy to those transactions goes too far. If the existence of a scheme is germane to the disallowance[,] it cannot be ignored[,] whether or not the Minister assumed that the appellant knew about or was a party to the third party transactions that, according to the Reply, were an integral part of the scheme. If any of the facts assumed are truly within only the Crown\u2019s knowledge[,] the Crown probably has the onus of proving them[,] although this is ultimately for the trial judge to decide.[17]\n[31] On the authority of Gould, Justice D\u2019Auray, in Metrobec, stated that \u201cnothing prevents the respondent from pleading assumptions of fact relative to third parties, if the Minister used those facts to make the assessment.\u201d[18]\nV. ANALYSIS [32] In typical fashion, each Reply pleaded the assumptions of fact on which the Minister relied when issuing the Reassessments. Those assumptions are set out in paragraph 12 of the Ebert Reply, paragraph 14 of the Herman Reply and paragraph 14 of the DesRosiers Reply.\n[33] The Appellants seek to strike out the Impugned Assumptions from each Reply. I will consider each of those assumptions in turn.\nA. Fair Market Value of Wines [34] Subparagraph 12(f) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(e) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(g) of the DesRosiers Reply each pleaded the following assumed fact:\nThe fair market value of the wines donated by the Appellant and appraised by Nico van Duyvenbode was at most 20% (i.e., a ratio of 1\/5) of the amount stated on the charitable tax receipts; (the \u201cFMV Assumption\u201d).\n[35] The Appellants submit that the Minister\u2019s determination of the respective fair market values of the wines donated by the Appellants was based on an analysis of wines sold at charitable auctions in years preceding the years in which the Appellants donated their wines to the various charities. The Appellants also submit that the Minister\u2019s determination of fair market value was based on a statistical analysis and does not specify the actual fair market value determined by the Minister.\n[36] The Respondent submits that the FMV Assumption explains why the Minister took the position that the charitable tax credits should be calculated by reference to only 20% of the respective appraised values of the wines in question.\n[37] I read the FMV Assumption as indicating that the Minister assumed that the fair market value of each of the respective wines donated by the Appellants was 20% or less of the amount stated on the applicable charitable tax receipt. I would think that each of the Appellants takes the position that the fair market value of the wines donated by him was equal to 100% of the amounts stated on the charitable tax receipts. I do not view the FMV Assumption as not providing the Appellants with enough specificity to enable them to know the case they must meet. I would expect that they will each endeavour to adduce evidence to show that the fair market value of the donated wines was equal to the amounts shown on the charitable tax receipts.\n[38] The Appellants\u2019 submissions, as set out in paragraph 35 above, are arguments that the Appellants may advance at trial as to why the Minister\u2019s determination of the respective fair market values of the donated wines was flawed. However, those submissions are not a basis for striking out the FMV Assumption. If the Minister merely assumed, and acted on, a fair-market-value range (i.e., 0 to 20% of the official-receipt amount), without assuming a precise fair-market-value amount, then that is what should be pleaded.[19]\n[39] If an assumption of fact references a flawed methodology used by the Minister in appraising the donated wines, and if the Appellants show that the methodology was indeed flawed, that might be sufficient to demolish the assumption at trial. That might also be a reason, in part,[20] for allowing the Appeals, but it is not a reason for striking out the assumption from the Replies.\n[40] Acccordingly, subparagraph 12(f) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(e) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(g) of the DesRosiers Reply should not be struck out.\nB. Wines Sold at Auctions [41] Subparagraph 12(g) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(f) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(h) of the DesRosiers Reply each state the following assumption:\nThe charities disposed of the wines through their annual fine wine auctions; (the \u201cAuction Assumption\u201d).\n[42] The Appellants submit that the Auction Assumption lacks specificity and refers to wines that may, or may not, include the wines donated by the respective Appellants.\n[43] The Respondent submits that the contents of each Reply, particularly some of the subparagraphs that precede the Auction Assumption, make it clear that the word wines, as used in the Auction Assumption, refers to the wines donated by the particular Appellant. The Respondent also submits that the Auction Assumption refers to facts relating to the conditions in which the wines were sold, i.e., through annual auctions of fine wine, and that those conditions were relevant to the determination of fair market value.\n[44] I accept the submissions made by the Respondent. In particular, some of the preceding assumptions pleaded in the Replies provide the specificity desired by the Appellants. For instance, subparagraph (b) in each of the \u201cpleaded-assumptions\u201d paragraphs of the Replies states that the \u201cAppellant donated wines to registered charities,\u201d and subparagraph (c) of each of those paragraphs refers to \u201c[t]he wines donated by the Appellant.\u201d As well, as noted above, the FMV Assumption, which is set out in the subparagraph preceding the Auction Assumption, also refers to \u201cthe wines donated by the Appellant.\u201d From this, it follows that the word wines in subparagraph 12(g) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(f) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(h) of the DesRosiers Reply refers to specific wines, i.e., the wines donated by the particular Appellant.\n[45] I decline to strike out subparagraph 12(g) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(f) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(h) of the DesRosiers Reply.\nC. Depressed Market Values [46] Subparagraph 12(h) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(g) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(i) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nThe charitable auctions held in the NCR [i.e., the National Capital Region] brought a large number of fine wines to the local market, which resulted in a depressing of the market values; (the \u201cDepressed-Value Assumption\u201d).\n[47] The Appellants submit that the Depressed-Value Assumption refers to a group of facts which may or may not pertain to a particular Appellant and that it lacks specificity.\n[48] The Respondent submits that the Depressed-Value Assumption provides context about sales conditions and thus is relevant to the determination of the fair market value of the wines in question.\n[49] I accept that the Depressed-Value Assumption relates to the applicable market conditions, and is thus an acceptable assumption to plead.\n[50] Subparagraph 12(h) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(g) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(i) of the DesRosiers Reply should not be struck out.\nD. Wines Sold as Lots [51] Subparagraph 12(i) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(h) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(j) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nMost of the wines were sold as lots at the charitable auctions; (the \u201cSold-As-Lots Assumption\u201d).\n[52] The Appellants submit that the Sold-As-Lots Assumption refers to a group of facts which may or may not pertain to the particular Appellant, and that the assumption lacks specificity.\n[53] The Respondent submits that the Sold-As-Lots Assumption provides additional context in respect of the sales conditions, and is relevant to the determination of fair market value.\n[54] As noted above, the Depressed-Value Assumption, which immediately precedes the Sold-As-Lots Assumption, refers to \u201ca large number of fine wines [that were brought] to the local market.\u201d This phrase, rather than the phrase \u201cthe wines donated by the Appellant,\u201d might be the antecedent of the word wines in the Sold-As-Lots Assumption. Therefore, there might be a lack of clarity. However, I do not think that this possible lack of clarity is so great as to displace my view that the Sold-As-Lots Assumption provides context for the Minister\u2019s determination of the fair market value of each Appellant\u2019s wines.\n[55] I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Sold-As-Lots Assumption sets out a fact that may be applicable to the determination of fair market value. However, I also recognize that each Appellant may not have information concerning the manner in which wines donated by other donors were sold at the auctions, which may pose an evidentiary challenge for the Appellants. I point out, as stated above, that it is open to the trial judge to require that the burden of proving facts not within the knowledge of the Appellants is to be put on the Respondent.[21]\n[56] Subparagraph 12(i) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(h) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(j) of the DesRosiers Reply should not be struck out.\nE. Wines Sold As Is, Without Recourse [57] Subparagraph 12(j) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(i) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(k) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nThe wines were sold \u201cas is, without recourse\u201d at the charitable auctions; (the \u201cSold-As-Is Assumption\u201d).\n[58] The Appellants submit that the Sold-As-Is Assumption refers to a group of facts, which may or may not pertain to a particular Appellant, and that the assumption lacks specificity.\n[59] The Respondent submits that the Sold-As-Is Assumption provides additional context in respect of the relevant sale conditions, and is relevant to the determination of fair market value.\n[60] Similar to the above discussion of the Sold-As-Lots Assumption, there might be some lack of clarity, given that the word wines in the Sold-As-Is Assumption could refer to the \u201clarge number of fine wines\u201d that are mentioned in the Depressed-Value Assumption or to \u201cthe wines donated by the Appellant\u201d that are described in the FMV Assumption. However, overall, I am of the view that, notwithstanding this possible lack of clarity, the Sold-As-Is Assumption provides context for the Minister\u2019s determination of the fair market value of each Appellant\u2019s wines.\n[61] Subparagraph 12(j) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(i) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(k) of the DesRosiers Reply should not be struck out.\nF. Donors\u2019 Participation in Auctions [62] Subparagraph 12(k) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(j) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(l) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nMany wine donors actively participated in the charitable auctions; (the \u201cParticipation Assumption\u201d).\n[63] The Appellants submit that the Participation Assumption refers to a group of donors, which may, or may not, include a particular Appellant. The Appellants also submit that there is a lack of specificity.\n[64] The Respondent submits that the Participation Assumption suggests a link between the donors\u2019 behaviour (i.e., their active participation in the auctions) and the alleged independence of the appraiser who appraised the wines donated by the Appellants. The Respondent also submits that the occurrences of some donors repurchasing the wines that they had donated (which presumably indicates that those donors actively participated in the auctions) shows artificiality in the appraisals and donation process. Finally, the Respondent submits that, in the case of Mr. Ebert and Mr. DesRosiers, in respect of whom penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA were assessed, the Participation Assumption has some application to those penalties, even though the Appellants have not specifically mentioned penalties in their Notices of Appeal, and thus, do not appear to be challenging the penalties.\n[65] Rather than focusing on the activities of the respective Appellants, the Participation Assumption references the activities of many of the wine donors. As noted above, in the discussion of the Status-One decisions, a court must exercise caution when the Crown seeks to include the actions of third parties in the pleadings.[22] Where the actions of third parties are alleged, the relevance or irrelevance of those allegations should be assessed in light of the pleadings.[23] Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the Minister to specify the link between the actions of the third parties and the actions of the specific taxpayer.[24]\n[66] There is nothing in any of the three Replies that suggests a connection, let alone a specific link, between a particular Appellant and the other wine donors. In the Respondent\u2019s Written Representations, the Respondent submits that the Participation Assumption \u201csuggests a link between the donors\u2019 behaviour (that is, their active participation in the auctions) and the appraiser\u2019s independence.\u201d[25] However, as stated in Status-One, a link, if any, between a specific taxpayer and third parties is to be determined by reference to the pleadings, and not by reference to written submissions filed in respect of a motion. Furthermore, the link between the actions of the third parties and the actions of the taxpayer must be specified, and not merely suggested. Accordingly, it is my view that the Respondent has not shown that there is a link between the active participation of many wine donors in the charitable auctions and the actions of the three Appellants.\n[67] If the Minister assumed that each of the Appellants actively participated in the auctions, it seems to me, without having researched, considered or analyzed this point thoroughly, that it would have been sufficient for the Respondent\u2019s purposes if the Respondent had pleaded something like the following:\nThe Appellant actively participated in the charitable auctions.\nIn any event, my research, consideration and analysis of the jurisprudence (as set out, in part, in paragraphs 28 through 31 above) has persuaded me that the Participation Assumption, as written, is too broad.\n[68] Subparagraph 12(k) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(j) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(l) of the DesRosiers Reply are struck out, with leave to amend, provided that any such amendment either is limited to the actions of the particular Appellant or clearly specifies the link between the actions of that Appellant and the active participation of the other wine donors in the auctions.\nG. Donors Repurchased Donated Wines [69] Subparagraph 12(l) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(k) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(m) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nIn some cases, wine donors repurchased the wines they donated; (the \u201cRepurchase Assumption\u201d).\n[70] The Appellants submit that the Repurchase Assumption refers to a group of donors, which may, or may not, include a particular Appellant. The Appellants also submit that there is a lack of specificity.\n[71] The Respondent takes the same position in respect of the Repurchase Assumption as in respect of the Participation Assumption.\n[72] Similar to the comment that I made in paragraph 67 above, it seems to me that it would have been sufficient if the Respondent had pleaded:\nThe Appellant repurchased some or all of the wines he donated.\n[73] The comments that I made above in respect of the Participation Assumption apply to the Repurchase Assumption, as well. Thus, in my view, the Repurchase Assumption, as written, is too broad.\n[74] Subparagraph 12(l) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(k) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(m) of the DesRosiers Reply are struck out, with leave to amend, provided that any such amendment either is limited to the actions of the particular Appellant or clearly specifies the link between the actions of that Appellant and the repurchase of wines by the other donors.\nH. Repurchase of Wines at a Profit at Auctions in 2001 and 2004 [75] Subparagraph 12(m) of the Ebert Reply states:\nThe Appellant repurchased wines he donated at a profit at charitable auctions held in 2001 and 2004; (the \u201cProfit Assumption\u201d).\nA corresponding provision was not pleaded by the Respondent in the Herman Reply or the DesRosiers Reply.\n[76] Mr. Ebert submits that the Profit Assumption is irrelevant, as it relates to alleged activities in 2001 and 2004, whereas the taxation years that are in issue in his Appeals are 2005 through 2013 inclusive. He further submits that the Profit Assumption is scandalous and was included merely to cast aspersions on him.\n[77] The Respondent submits that the Profit Assumption suggests a link between Mr. Ebert\u2019s behaviour and the appraiser\u2019s independence, and also supports the Minister\u2019s understanding of artificiality in the appraisals and donation process. In addition, the Respondent submits that the Profit Assumption relates to the penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the ITA.\n[78] The Profit Assumption is, in my view, ambiguous. It is not clear whether the Respondent assumed that Mr. Ebert, at previous charitable auctions, repurchased wines at a profit or donated wines at a profit. In other words, the antecedent of the phrase at a profit is not clear. Is that antecedent the prior repurchase of wines or the prior donation of wines? Given that the phrase at a profit immediately follows the word donated and not the words repurchased wines, the usual rules of grammar suggest that at a profit modifies donated.\n[79] If the phrase at a profit refers to the donation of wines, a further difficulty arises. Given that a donation or gift is, by definition, without consideration, it is not clear how a donation can be made at a profit. Perhaps the Minister had in mind that the amount of the tax credit arising from the charitable gift was greater than the fair market value of the wines that were the subject of the gift. However, it is not clear that this is what the Profit Assumption is pleading.\n[80] If it was the repurchase of wines that was allegedly done at a profit, again there is a lack of clarity, as a profit usually arises on a sale or disposition of property, rather than on a repurchase of property (although there may be exceptions, such as in a short sale). Perhaps the Minister was assuming that, when Mr. Ebert donated wines to charities in 2001 and 2004, those wines were appraised at a fair market value greater than the price that he subsequently paid to repurchase the same wines at the auctions. However, that is by no means clear from the Profit Assumption, as written.\n[81] As noted above, Mr. Ebert takes issue with the Respondent\u2019s pleading of transactions that occurred in taxation years preceding the taxation years that are the subject of Mr. Ebert\u2019s Appeals. In situations that might be viewed as somewhat reversed, where a taxpayer argues that in a subsequent taxation year the Minister should extend the same treatment to the taxpayer as was extended in previous years, the courts have stated that \u201c[a]n assessment is conclusive as between the parties only in relation to the assessment for the year [in] which it was made.\u201d[26] In a situation concerning the deductibility, in a particular taxation year, of expenses that are similar to expenses that were allowed by the Minister in preceding taxation years, the court is \u201cnot bound by how the respondent may have treated similar claims in previous years.\u201d[27] As was stated in Hawkes:\n\u2026 the fact that the Minister has assessed one return of a taxpayer in a different way from another return \u2026 is not proof that any particular assessment is incorrect. That is a matter for determination on appeal.[28]\n[82] In this Motion, I am dealing with a different situation, but I believe that an analogy may be drawn from the principles set out above. The question of whether Mr. Ebert may have \u201crepurchased wines he donated at a profit at charitable auctions held in 2001 and 2004\u201d (whatever that phrase may mean) does not seem to be indicative of what he may have done during the period 2005 to 2013 inclusive. I have not found anything in the Ebert Reply that explains a connection between the 2001 and 2004 transactions and the donations of wine that are the subject of Mr. Ebert\u2019s Appeals.\n[83] It is not clear whether the assumed facts referenced in the Profit Assumption, if put into evidence, would be viewed as similar-fact evidence in support of propensity reasoning, or as circumstantial evidence relating to the assessments in issue in respect of the 2005 through 2013 taxation years.[29] Nor is it clear whether the assumed facts, if put into evidence, would be too distant in time from the facts that are the subject of the Reassessments.[30] To summarize, the Ebert Reply does not show \u201ca real and substantial nexus or connection between the act or allegation made [i.e., the gifts of wines in 2005 to 2013 inclusive], \u2026 and facts relating to previous \u2026 transactions [i.e., the repurchase of wines in 2001 and 2004].\u201d[31]\n[84] Subparagraph 12(m) of the Ebert Reply is struck out, with leave to amend, provided that any such amendment:\n(a) clearly, and without ambiguity, identifies and explains the transactions in 2001 and 2004 that were the subject of the assumption made by the Minister in reassessing Mr. Ebert in respect of the 2005 through 2013 taxation years;\n(b) specifies a real and substantial nexus or connection between the transactions in 2001 and 2004 and the donations of wines in 2005 through 2013; and\n(c) does not invoke propensity reasoning.[32]\nI. Wines Sold for 20% of Appraised Value [85] Subparagraph 12(n) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(l) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(n) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nThe wines appraised by Nico van Duyvenbode were sold at the charitable auctions, on average, for 20% of the appraised value; (the \u201c20% Assumption\u201d).\n[86] The Appellants submit that the 20% Assumption is based on an irrelevant statistical analysis from taxation years preceding the years that are the subject of the Appeals. Furthermore, according to the Appellants, the 20% Assumption lacks specificity, as it refers to an average of values found in another context.\n[87] The Respondent submits that the 20% Assumption relates to the Minister\u2019s determination of the fair market value of the donated wines, and that it references the Minister\u2019s understanding of artificiality in the appraisals and donation process. In addition, the Respondent asserts that the 20% Assumption is particularly applicable to Mr. Ebert and Mr. DesRosiers, who were assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA.\n[88] As Justice Boyle noted in McCuaig Balkwill, there are three markets in which an individual resident in Ontario may sell, or otherwise dispose of, wine:\na)auctions of collectible wines, hosted by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (\u201cLCBO\u201d);\nb)non-LCBO global consignment auctions and sellers; and\nc)donations to charities, to be sold in charitable auctions.[33]\n[89] After identifying the above markets, Justice Boyle then said:\nPrices for a purchase and sale in these markets are obviously relevant to, but not necessarily determinative of, a wine\u2019s fair market value determination by this Court.[34]\nHence, I do not consider the reference in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings to the prices at which particular wines were sold at charitable auctions to be improper or irrelevant.\n[90] Thus, in my view, the 20% Assumption is permissible, as it indicates that the price at which wines were sold at the charitable auctions was a factor considered by the Minister in determining the fair market value of those wines. As sales of wines at charitable auctions appear to be acceptable comparables that may be considered by an appraiser when appraising wines, the 20% Assumption should be allowed to stand. However, even if the Appellants were to show that a charitable auction sale is not an acceptable comparable,[35] the 20% Assumption would not prejudice the Appellants, as they could refer to the assumption to show that the Minister\u2019s appraiser relied on an unacceptable comparable, and thus used an inappropriate appraisal methodology.\n[91] It seems that each Appellant, on the one hand, and the Respondent, on the other hand, are alleging that the other\u2019s appraiser used a flawed appraisal methodology. More specifically, the Notices of Motion state that, in response to a Demand for Particulars, the Respondent indicated that the Minister\u2019s allegation, to the effect that Mr. van Duyvenbode\u2019s appraisal methodology was flawed, was based on the Minister\u2019s analysis of random sets of samples from 18 different auctions of eight charitable organizations, from May 31, 2001 to December 2, 2004. According to the Minister, that analysis showed that the appraised values determined by Mr. van Duyvenbode were, on average, 5.21 times greater than the auction sale price. It appears that the Minister\u2019s allegation is premised on a further allegation that Mr. van Duyvenbode used the same appraisal methodology for the appraisals of wines donated between 2005 and 2013 inclusive as he had used in respect of the wines donated between 2001 and 2004 inclusive. For their part, the Appellants allege that the Minister\u2019s appraisal methodology was flawed because it used data from 2001 to 2004, rather than from 2005 to 2013. However, if the Minister\u2019s appraiser used a flawed appraisal methodology, that is an argument that may be advanced by the Appellants at trial, but it is not a reason for striking out the 20% Assumption.[36]\n[92] Subparagraph 12(n) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(l) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(n) of the DesRosiers Reply should not be struck out.\nJ. Mr. van Duyvenbode\u2019s Activities [93] Subparagraph 12(o) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(m) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(o) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nNico van Duyvenbode solicited potential donors, provided the appraisals, collected the wine bottles, grouped them into lots, delivered them to the charities, and was involved as a bidder at the auctions; (the \u201cActivities Assumption\u201d).\n[94] The written representations included in the Notices of Motion filed by the Appellants do not set out any specific submissions in respect of the Activities Assumption, other than perhaps to imply that the wine bottles referenced therein were not collected from the Appellants specifically, but rather, were collected from some or all of the wine donors in general.\n[95] The Respondent submits that the Activities Assumption pertains to the allegation in each of the Notices of Appeal to the effect that the appraiser (i.e., Mr. van Duyvenbode) was an independent appraiser. The Respondent also submits that the Activities Assumption relates to the Minister\u2019s understanding of the artificiality in the appraisals and donation process.\n[96] I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Activities Assumption addresses the allegation in each of the Notices of Appeal that Mr. van Duyvenbode was an independent appraiser. I acknowledge that the Appellants may not have personal knowledge of the activities of Mr. van Duyvenbode, and thus, may not be in a position to lead evidence to demolish this assumption. It will be for the trial judge to determine whether the Respondent should bear the burden of proof in respect of the Activities Assumption.\n[97] Subparagraph 12(o) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(m) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(o) of the DesRosiers Reply are not to be struck out.\nK. Payments to Mr. van Duyvenbode [98] Subparagraph 12(p) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(n) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(p) of the DesRosiers Reply each state:\nThe charities paid Nico van Duyvenbode 10% of the hammer prices for which the wines were sold at the auctions; (the \u201cPayment Assumption\u201d).\n[99] The Appellants\u2019 written representations set out in their Notices of Motion do not make any specific submissions in respect of the Payment Assumption, although there is a general submission that, apart from the FMV Assumption, to the extent that the other Impugned Assumptions refer to wines, those references do not refer to the wines donated by the Appellants, but rather, refer to the wines that were the subject of the Minister\u2019s statistical analysis.\n[100] The Respondent submits that the facts assumed in the Payment Assumption provide a basis to question the independence of Mr. van Duyvenbode as the appraiser of the wines donated by the Appellants (as well as the appraiser of many of the other donated wines).\n[101] I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Payment Assumption, like the Activities Assumption, questions the independence of Mr. van Duyvenbode, and thus challenges the statement in each of the Notices of Appeal to the effect that Mr. van Duyvenbode was an independent appraiser.\n[102] As the Appellants may not have any knowledge of any payments made by any charity to Mr. van Duyvenbode, it will be for the trial judge to determine whether the Respondent should bear the burden of proof in respect of the Payment Assumption.\n[103] I acknowledge that there is a question as to whether the word wines in the Payment Assumption refers to only the wines donated by the Appellants, to the wines that were the subject of the Minister\u2019s statistical analysis, or to some or all of the wines donated by some or all of the donors. This is a question to be left to the trial judge, who will have the opportunity to hear and consider all of the evidence.\n[104] I decline to strike out subparagraph 12(p) of the Ebert Reply, subparagraph 14(n) of the Herman Reply and subparagraph 14(p) of the DesRosiers Reply.\nVI. CONCLUSION [105] The Impugned Assumptions that are struck out are summarized below:\n(a)Subparagraphs 12(k), 12(l) and 12(m) of the Ebert Reply are struck out, with leave to amend, subject to the conditions specified in these Reasons.\n(b)Subparagraphs 14(j) and 14(k) of the Herman Reply are struck out, with leave to amend, subject to the conditions specified in these Reasons.\n(c)Subparagraphs 14(l) and 14(m) of the DesRosiers Reply are struck out, with leave to amend, subject to the conditions specified in these Reasons.\n[106] For greater certainty, the other Impugned Assumptions in the Ebert Reply, the Herman Reply and the DesRosiers Reply are not struck out.\n[107] The costs in respect of these Motions will be costs in the cause, unless otherwise determined by the trial judge.\nSigned at Edmonton, Alberta this 18th day of April 2023.\n\u201cDon R.

Introduction\n[1] This is an application by Mr. Laing for an extension of time to file a notice of objection with the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) pursuant to section 166.2 of the Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp), as amended (ITA) to a reassessment made by Notice of reassessment dated November 14, 2014 for his 2012 taxation year. The application was filed at the Registry of the Court on October 17, 2019.\n[2] Mr. Laing testified at the hearing. No other witnesses were called.\nII. Context\n[3] On or about April 30, 2014, the Applicant filed his 2012 income tax return.\n[4] On May 8, 2014, a few days later, a notice of assessment (arbitrary) was issued by the Minister for the 2012 taxation year of the Applicant.\n[5] On August 28, 2014, September 23, 2014 and November 12, 2014, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sent correspondence to the Applicant regarding his filing for the 2012 taxation year.\n[6] The September 23, 2014 correspondence was a request for information and documents in order for the CRA to address the changes requested in respect inter alia of his 2012 taxation year.\n[7] The November 12, 2014 correspondence was a letter not made available to the Court and presumably confirming that the CRA could not process the change in the Applicant\u2019s returns for the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years.\n[8] On November 14, 2014, a notice of reassessment was issued by the Minister for the Applicant\u2019s 2012 taxation year.\n[9] On July 4, 2019, a notice of objection was served on the Minister on behalf of the Applicant\u2019s 2012 taxation year. The Applicant was then represented by an agent Mr. Graig Miller, a chartered accountant from BDO Canada LLP.\n[10] On July 18, 2019, the Appeals Division of the CRA informed the Applicant that the notice of objection was filed outside the prescribed time limit. The letter confirmed that the Minister could not grant him an extension of time to file a notice of objection as such application should have been made by the Applicant on or before February 12, 2016.\n[11] On October 17, 2019, the Applicant filed this application with the Tax Court of Canada requesting for an extension of time to file a notice of objection. The reason supporting the application to extend time is \u201cI intended to file an appeal. I was waiting to hear back from accountant for advice. We ended up missing the date by 1 day.\u201d\n[12] Between late 2019 and 2022, Mr. Miller ceased to act on behalf of the Applicant. No specific time was provided by the Applicant.\nIII. Issue in dispute\n[13] The issue before this Court is whether the Applicant\u2019s application for an extension of time to file the notice of objection should be granted.\nIV. Position of the Applicant\n[14] Mr. Laing believes that he is entitled to ask the Court to grant his application, although he does not recall perfectly the sequence of events as the application for an extension of time to file the notice of objection and the notice of objection attached to it were filed by his agent Mr. Graig Miller, a chartered accountant from BDO Canada LLP. Mr. Laing confirmed that Mr. Miller is not acting on his behalf anymore and following the termination of Mr. Miller\u2019s mandate did not get a copy of his file including all correspondence he received from the CRA in respect of his 2012 taxation year. Considering this situation, Mr. Laing admitted having an incomplete understanding of the entire sequence surrounding his 2012 taxation year, both in respect of what was initiated by him or Mr. Miller and by the CRA because the entire file is still with Mr. Miller.\n[15] Notwithstanding the foregoing, he confirmed having filed his 2012 income tax return late on or about April 30, 2014. However, the CRA issued on May 8, 2014 an arbitrary notice of assessment in respect of his 2012 taxation year. Mr. Laing admitted having received the original 2012 notice of assessment. However, he believes that he did not receive a subsequent reassessment for his 2012 taxation year reflecting his filing for that year. He does not deny that he may have received a subsequent notice of assessment or reassessment on or about November 14, 2014 but the subsequent notice did not reflect the return he filed for his 2012 taxation year. He believes that the notice of reassessment filed before the Court at the hearing is a replicate of the original assessment.\n[16] Mr. Laing believes that there was a mistake by the CRA when he was reassessed or assessed him again in November 2014. According to him, this Court has to abide by rules of equity and fairness, and the submissions that were provided to the Court by the Respondent are proof that what they thought was a reassessment is not in fact the reassessment that was done. There was a mistake.\nV. Position of the Respondent\n[17] The Respondent is of the view that the Appellant filed the application for an extension of time to file the notice of objection outside the prescribed time limit for doing so. The Applicant\u2019s 2012 taxation year was reassessed by notice of reassessment dated November 14, 2014. The Applicant filed a notice of objection on July 4, 2019. The notice of objection and the application to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection was due on or before February 12, 2016. The application does not satisfy the condition of paragraph 166.2(5)(a) ITA and therefore must be dismissed.\nVI. Analysis\n(a) legislative provisions\n[18] Subsection 165(1) ITA allows a taxpayer to object to an assessment by the Minister subject to certain deadlines:\n165(1) Objections to assessment \u2014 A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) where the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual (other than a trust) or a testamentary trust, on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of mailing of the notice of assessment;\n. . .\n[emphasis added.]\n[19] In the event a notice of objection is not filed by the individual against a notice of assessment or reassessment within the time period provided for in subsection 165(1) ITA, sections 166.1 and 166.2 ITA deal with a taxpayer\u2019s ability to obtain an extension of the time to file the notice of objection:\n166.1(1) Extension of time by Minister \u2014 Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165, nor any request under subsection 245(6) made, within the time limited by those provisions for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection or making the request.\n. . .\n(7) When order to be made \u2014 No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\n166.2(1) Extension of time by Tax Court \u2014 A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\n. . .\n(5) When application to be granted \u2014 No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[emphasis added.]\n[20] The Applicant has the burden of proving that he meets the conditions which would allow the Court to grant him an extension.\n(b) applicable treatment\n- jurisdiction issue\n[21] The Court believes that the underlying matter raises a question of jurisdiction under subsection 161.2(1) ITA in fine. This question must first be addressed in order to determine whether the Court is lawfully seized of the Applicant's application. Without jurisdiction, the Court is not entitled to decide whether the conditions giving rise to the Applicant's application are met and therefore, the application must be dismissed.\n[22] The Applicant\u2019s agent filed with the CRA a notice of objection on July 4, 2019. The main reasons raised in the objection relate to the issuance of an arbitrary assessment and the late filing of an income tax return by the taxpayer for the same year.\n[23] The Applicant received a response from the CRA dated July 18, 2019 regarding the objection filed. The CRA confirmed not being able to grant the application for an extension of time to file an objection on the basis that the application should have been filed no later than February 12, 2016.\n[24] In response to the CRA\u2019s July 18, 2019 letter, the Applicant filed on October 17, 2019 with this Court an application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection in accordance with section 166.2 ITA. The Applicant\u2019s reason for the application to extend time expressly refers to the intention to file an appeal but acknowledge he was waiting to hear back from the accountant for advice and they ended up doing so one day late. The Court understands that the deadline the Applicant refers to is subsection 166.2(1) ITA in fine\u2019s deadline quoted in paragraph 19 above. The Court also understands that the accountant was still acting for the Applicant at that time of filing the application as the accountant wrote to the Court on October 24, 2019 confirming that he is representing the Applicant and wanted to add supporting documentation to the Applicant\u2019s application filed before the Court.\n[25] Subsection 244(14) ITA states:\n(14) For the purposes of this Act, where any notice or notification described in subsection 149.1(6.3), 152(3.1), 165(3) or 166.1(5) or any notice of assessment or determination is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice or notification.\n[emphasis added.]\n[26] The Applicant did not assert or allege, at the hearing or upon filing the application with the Court, that the July 18, 2019 notification was not mailed or received.\n[27] The Applicant\u2019s application filed with the Court on October 17, 2019 requesting for an extension to file a notice of objection was then filed after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the Applicant. The fact that the Applicant waited until October 17, 2019 to file the application with the Court is very unfortunate since the application is statute-barred. The Court has no authority to waive the statutory time limit referred to in subsection 166.2(1) ITA in fine.\n[28] The courts have firmly established that these deadlines are mandatory and may not be set aside. In applying section 166.1 ITA, Bowie J. of the Tax Court of Canada explained in Pereira (Pereira v The Queen, 2008 TCC 2, affirmed by 2008 FCA 264) that:\n22 . . . neither [the taxpayer\u2019s] misfortune nor the apparent negligence of his solicitor gives me licence to ignore mandatory provisions of the two statutes that were put there by Parliament in very precise terms and for very good reasons.\n[29] This was also discussed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada v Carlson, 2002 FCA 145 where Nadon, J.A. stated:\nAs this Court has held on numerous occasions, when a taxpayer is unable to meet the deadline prescribed by the Act, even by reason of a failure of the postal system, neither the Minister nor the TCC [Tax Court of Canada] can come to his help. (See Schafer v R., [2000] F.C.J. No. 1480 (Fed. C.A.) ; Bowen v Minister of National Revenue, 1991 CanLII 13528 (FCA)). Hence, if a postal failure cannot save a taxpayer, he will not be saved by his failure to grasp the significance of a notice of assessment served on him.\n[30] Based on the foregoing, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the Applicant\u2019s application as subsection 166.2(1) ITA precludes the Court from having authority to hear the Applicant\u2019s application filed after the expiration of the mandatory 90 days\u2019 delay. This situation suffices to dismiss the Applicant\u2019s application.\n- observation: the circumstances of the present case on the jurisdiction issue\n[31] Whether or not the notice of reassessment dated November 14, 2014 was received by the Applicant does not affect the absence of jurisdiction. A similar situation was addressed by this Court in Burke v The Queen, 2012 TCC 378:\n[27] With respect to the 1999 taxation year, Ms. Burke has failed to meet the first hurdle. The Minister denied her subsection 166.1(1) of the Act application made in April 2008 and notified her in May 2008. She did not apply to this Court within the requisite 90-day period. The Appellant argues that, assuming that Notices of Assessment or Reassessment were mailed for 1998 and 1999, the Respondent has not proven the date of mailing so the time period remains open. If I find that the 1998 and 1999 Notices of Assessment were mailed, which I do, it follows that by making the subsection 166.1(1) of the Act application to the Minister, there is some acknowledgment from Ms. Burke that she was aware of that fact, obviously prior to mailing the subsection 166.1(1) of the Act application. While there may not be conclusive proof from the Respondent as to exactly when the notices were mailed, I cannot turn a blind eye to the specific procedural requirements of the Act. If a taxpayer applies to the Minister for an extension, which Ms. Burke did in April 2008, and that request is denied, which it was in May 2008, Ms. Burke had 90 days to apply to this Court. She did not do that and cannot now claim that it does not matter because there is no proof of the date of mailing of the Notice of Assessment, effectively picking which rule she will or will not abide by. Once she decided to file the subsection 166.1(1) of the Act application to the Minister, it was incumbent on her to follow the procedure she had chosen to continue her objection. She did not.\n[28] The Court does not have jurisdiction to grant an application for extension of time to file a Notice of Objection for the 1999 taxation year when it is made past the 90-day limitations set forth in subsection 166.2(1) of the Act. The application is quashed.\n[emphasis added.]\n[32] In De Lucia Estate v The Queen, 2010 TCC 479 [De Lucia], Justice Hogan of this Court was also dealing with a situation similar to the present case. In De Lucia, the applicant did not allege that the reassessment was not properly sent and the CRA did not introduce evidence that it was, but by letter dated August 4, 2009 the CRA rejected the notice of objection and the request for an extension of time on the grounds that the 90-day deadline to object had passed and more than one year had elapsed from the expiry of the 90-day deadline to object:\nThe letter dated August 4, 2009 from the CRA to the Applicant clearly stated that they would not grant an extension of the time for filing an objection. Thus, the Applicant had 90 days from that date in which to file the application currently under consideration by the Court. The fact that she waited until February 19, 2010 to do so is unfortunate since the application is clearly statute-barred.\n[emphasis added.]\n[33] The sequence set by the Applicant that includes (i) a notice of objection filed on July 4, 2019, (ii) a decision letter from the CRA dated July 18, 2019 denying the Applicant\u2019s right to object and to an extension of time, and (iii) an application filed by the Applicant on October 17, 2019 before this Court, confirmed the applicable provision of the ITA that could give this Court authority to act in the present case. This central provision is section 166.2 ITA.\n[34] Therefore, and notwithstanding the circumstances raised by the Applicant, section 166.2 ITA must be applicable in order to vest jurisdiction in the Court to hear the Applicant\u2019s application. Unfortunately, subsection 166.2(1) ITA in fine does not give the Court jurisdiction to be seized of the Applicant\u2019s application as the application was filed with the Court after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision under subsection 166.1(5) ITA was mailed to the Applicant.\n- additional observation: condition in 166.2(5)(a) ITA\n[35] Even if this Court accepts a moment that subsection 166.2(1) ITA in fine does not preclude the Court from having jurisdiction to hear the Applicant\u2019s application, which it does not, it would then have to be established inter alia that the Applicant has fulfilled the condition of paragraph 166.2(5)(a) ITA.\n[36] According to the CRA\u2019s decision letter dated July 19, 2019, the ultimate deadline for filing an application with the Minister under subsection 166.1(1) ITA covering the 90-day period to file a notice of objection and the one-year period following the 90-day period was February 12, 2016.\n[37] The notice of objection filed by the Applicant and his agent at the time was filed on July 4, 2019. Therefore, the only possibility for the Applicant to succeed would have been to establish that the notice of reassessment was not sent or mailed by the CRA on November 14, 2014. Otherwise, paragraph 248(7) ITA deems the notice to have been received and whether the notice is received by the taxpayer becomes irrelevant (see Mpamugo v The Queen, 2016 TCC 215 (upheld on appeal (2017 FCA 136) [Mpamugo]).\n[38] Justice Graham of this Court in Mpamugo, and later in DaSilva v The Queen, 2018 TCC 74, reviews the 4 steps that need to be satisfied when a taxpayer alleges that the Minister did not mail\/send a notice of assessment. In some cases, this issue can become relevant because the limitation period for filing a notice of objection started with the sending of a notice of assessment or reassessment (subsection 165(1) ITA). Once the sending date is established (either through presumption in the ITA or through proof of a different date), the assessment is deemed to have been made on that date (subsection 244(15) ITA) and the notice of assessment is deemed to have been received on that date (subsection 248(7) ITA).\n[39] The first step identified by Justice Graham is for the taxpayer to assert that the notice of assessment was not sent. A taxpayer normally does so in one of two ways. The taxpayer may assert that he or she did not receive the notice of assessment and thus believes that it was not sent. Alternatively, the taxpayer may assert that the notice was sent to the wrong address through no fault of the taxpayer and was thus, in effect, not sent. The Federal Court of Appeal made it clear in Mpamugo that if the taxpayer\u2019s assertion is not credible, there is no need to proceed to Step 2.\n[40] There is no mention in the application filed by the Applicant with the Court that a reassessment was not sent. Moreover, during the Applicant\u2019s testimony and cross-examination, the Court is of the view that the Applicant did not, on a balance of probabilities, succeed in alleging that the notice of reassessment was not sent by the CRA. The Applicant was sometimes certain and sometimes uncertain about the fact that he received the notice of reassessment dated November 14, 2014 and sometimes believed that he might have received it. He mentioned initially in his testimony that he never received the reassessment. During the last segment of his testimony and the submissions, he was \u201cabsolutely positive that one was done,\u201d \u201cvery positive, very sure, that there was a reassessment done, I have just never received it\u201d. According to this Court, the fact that all his documents remain with his former agent combined with a limited understanding of the accountant\u2019s reasons for the application made him hesitant, inconsistent and uncertain about important facts. Moreover, the initiative before the Court was his accountant\u2019s advice at the time and the Applicant did not have a clear understanding of its legal value. The situation about whether the notice was received is not relevant for purposes of the test.\n[41] From the application, testimony and submissions, the Court found that the Applicant did not allege that the notice of reassessment was not sent. The lack of consistency during the Applicant\u2019s testimony in relation to the notice of reassessment does not support a credible testimony on this central issue. The Court cannot find that the Applicant was credible if he has sought to assert that the notice of reassessment was not sent. Unfortunately, the explanations offered by the Applicant in this regard are ambivalent and unclear, and are not sufficiently convincing or persuasive in retrospect to allow the Court to accept a credible testimony from the Applicant that Step 1 could be satisfied. Even in respect of the possibility that the notice of reassessment might not have been received, which as mentioned is not in and of itself sufficient, the evidence and submissions at the hearing do not explain the rationale, or offer any reasons, explanations or circumstances that could have been responsible or relevant for not having received the reassessment, although all other correspondence was received. The Appellant's management and diligence with respect to his tax records, which were exposed at the hearing, were also not aspects that appeared supportive of his case.\n[42] Therefore, even if this Court accepts a moment as mentioned above, which it does not, that subsection 166.2(1) ITA in fine does not preclude the Court from having jurisdiction to deal with the Applicant\u2019s application, Step 1 above would not be satisfied as no credible evidence or explanations on the issue of not sending the notice of reassessment was given or alleged at the hearing or in the proceedings.\n[43] The Court is a statutory court. The Court is not an equity court, and unfortunately cannot address unfair situations.\nVII. Conclusion\n[44] While the above analysis discusses various factors that might have been determinative in other circumstances, the lack of jurisdiction in this case is sufficient to justify the Court's decision. Regrettably, and although sympathetic circumstances were presented, no legal or factual basis or combination thereof affords this Court the power to grant the application.\n[45] For all these reasons, the application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection with the Minister pursuant to section 166.2 ITA relating to the Applicant\u2019s 2012 taxation year will be dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec, this 19th day of April 2023.\n\u201cJ.M.

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 51\nDate: 20230510\nDocket: 2014-3806(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nEMMANUEL AZZOPARDI,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Emmanuel Azzopardi, invested in a film tax shelter as a partner in a limited partnership. He argues that he is entitled to have a say in how the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) redetermined the 2001 loss of that partnership \u2013 Grosvenor Services 2001 Limited Partnership (the \u201cPartnership\u201d) \u2013 in which he held an interest of .114503%.\nOverview [2] The Appellant has two main complaints. First, that the CRA failed to include him in the objection process culminating in the redetermination of the Partnership\u2019s loss. Second, that the CRA failed to provide him with the documents necessary to dispute that redetermination before this Court.\n[3] Unfortunately for the Appellant, when the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) determines a partnership\u2019s income or loss, only one partner of the partnership is entitled to object. That partner is known under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) as the \u201cdesignated member\u201d. Because the Appellant was not designated, or otherwise authorized, by the Partnership for that purpose, he was not entitled to object to the Minister\u2019s determination or participate in the negotiations that concluded in the redetermination of the Partnership\u2019s 2001 loss.\n[4] The redetermination of the Partnership\u2019s loss was binding on all the partners. The Minister had one year within which to reassess the Appellant to give effect to that redetermination. The Minister reassessed the Appellant within that time. Accordingly, the Appellant\u2019s appeals must be dismissed.\nThe appeals and the trial [5] The Appellant appealed reassessments for his 2001, 2003, and 2005 taxation years. He also appealed the assessment for his 2011 taxation year. I will deal with the last year first.\n[6] The Appellant could not explain why he appealed the assessment of his 2011 taxation year. The Notice of Objection in respect of that assessment stated: \u201cThe amount of the Capital gains included in the income on t5013 was overstated.\u201d[1] But the Appellant himself had made a T1 adjustment request for that year to include a taxable capital gain of $99,575.19 on the disposition of his interest in the Partnership and that is exactly how the Minister assessed.[2] The Appellant effectively withdrew his objection when he conceded that the \u201ccorrect capital gains amount was included.\u201d[3] The Appellant\u2019s appeal of the assessment for his 2011 taxation year will be dismissed.\n[7] The Appellant\u2019s appeals of the reassessments for his 2003 and 2005 taxation years relate to carryforwards of alternative minimum tax flowing directly from the reassessment of his 2001 taxation year. The disposition of the Appellant\u2019s appeals for those years, therefore, turns entirely on the disposition of his 2001 appeal.\n[8] The Appellant represented himself at trial. His only witness was his accountant, Mr. Alexander Menzies. Mr. Menzies was the one who told the Appellant about the Partnership. The Crown called Ms. Tarvinder Kaur, a tax appeals case specialist at the Appeals Branch of the CRA in Ottawa. Ms. Kaur provided evidence regarding the \u201cdesignated member\u201d of the Partnership.\nThe role of the \u201cdesignated member\u201d of a partnership on objection [9] Subsection 165(1.15) of the Act provides that, if the Minister makes a determination of a partnership\u2019s income or loss, the only person entitled to serve a notice of objection on the Minister is a member of the partnership who is either (a) designated in the partnership information return or (b) otherwise authorized by the partnership to so act:[4]\n165(1.15) Notwithstanding subsection 165(1), where the Minister makes a determination under subsection 152(1.4) in respect of a fiscal period of a partnership, an objection in respect of the determination may be made only by one member of the partnership, and that member must be either\n(a) designated for that purpose in the information return made under section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations for the fiscal period; or\n(b) otherwise expressly authorized by the partnership to so act.\n[10] Based on this provision, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that \u201cthe rights of appeal from a determination are restricted to a designated or authorized member of the partnership.\u201d[5] In Tedesco v Canada, 2019 FCA 235, the Federal Court of Appeal reviewed the relevant legislative context:\n[17] A partnership does not pay tax under the Act. Rather, a partnership computes its income (or loss) as if it were a person and then allocates to each partner that partner\u2019s proportionate share of such income (or loss). Accordingly, there is no assessment or reassessment of tax payable by a partnership. As a result, if the Minister should disagree with the amount of any income (or loss) claimed by a partnership and allocated to its partners, the Minister will have to reassess each partner. To avoid multiple disputes with several partners with respect to the amount of any income (or loss) of a particular partnership, subsection 152(1.4) of the Act was added to allow the Minister to make one determination of the amount of any income (or loss) of a partnership. \u2026\n[18] Subsection 165(1.15) of the Act provides that a notice of objection to a determination made under subsection 152(1.4) of the Act may be made only by one member of the partnership who is duly designated or authorized to do so. \u2026\n[19] Subsection 152(1.7) of the Act provides that, subject to the rights of objection and appeal, the determination made by the Minister under subsection 152(1.4) of the Act of the income (or loss) of the partnership is binding on the Minister and each member of the partnership. Subsection 152(1.7) of the Act also provides that the Minister may, notwithstanding subsection 152(4) of the Act, reassess each partner \u201cbefore the end of the day that is one year after the day on which all rights of objection and appeal expire or are determined in respect of the determination or redetermination\u201d.\n[emphasis added]\n[11] In Lux Operating Limited Partnership v The Queen, 2018 TCC 141 [Lux TCC], Justice Graham observed that the Minister has a choice as to whether to proceed by assessing or reassessing each partner individually (the \u201ctraditional process\u201d) or by making a determination or redetermination at the partnership level that binds all partners and allows the Minister to assess or reassess each partner to give effect to the determination or redetermination (the \u201cstreamlined process\u201d):[6]\n[7] Partnerships are, with rare exceptions, not persons and not liable to tax under the Act. However, partnerships are required to file information returns in a prescribed form reporting their income or loss as if they were a person (Income Tax Regulations, section 229). The partners of the partnership then report their share of the partnership income or loss in their own tax returns (subsection 96(1)).\n[8] The Minister has three years from the day that is the later of the day that the partnership return is due to be filed and the day that it is actually filed to dispute the income or loss reported in the information return (subsection 152(1.4)). If the Minister disagrees with the income or loss reported in the information return, the Minister has two options.\n[9] The traditional, less efficient option is for the Minister to reassess each partner individually to adjust the partner\u2019s share of the partnership\u2019s income or loss. I will refer to this option as the \u201cTraditional Process\u201d. Under the Traditional Process, if the partners disagree with the Minister\u2019s view of the partnership\u2019s income, they may individually object to and appeal from their reassessments. The Traditional Process was the only option available to the Minister prior to the introduction of subsection 152(1.4) and related provisions in 1998.\n[10] The second, more streamlined option is for the Minister to determine the correct income or loss of the partnership (subsection 152(1.4)). I will refer to this option as the \u201cStreamlined Process\u201d. The Streamlined Process has the advantage of resolving any dispute about the partnership\u2019s income or loss at the partnership level. If the Minister makes a determination under subsection 152(1.4), she then sends a Notice of Determination to the partnership and to each partner who was a member of the partnership during the relevant fiscal period (subsection 152(1.5)). The determination is binding on the Minister and each partner unless it is objected to or the Minister issues a subsequent redetermination (paragraph 152(1.7)(a)). The next steps in the Streamlined Process depend on whether the partnership wishes to dispute the determination or not. If the partnership decides not to dispute the determination, the Minister may then reassess the individual partners to give effect to the determination. Reassessment is an important step in the process because it is the partners, not the partnership, that pay tax. If the partnership decides to dispute the determination, the dispute proceeds through the usual process. The objection and appeal provisions normally applicable to assessments apply to determinations (subsection 152(1.2)). However, one partner, known as the designated partner, disputes the determination on behalf of all of the partners (subsection 165(1.15)). That partner is generally the partner who was designated for that purpose in the information return filed by the partnership. If the dispute is resolved in a way that results in a change in the partnership\u2019s income or loss, the Minister may reassess the individual partners to give effect to the outcome. Again, reassessment is an important step in the process because it is the partners, not the partnership, that pay tax.\n[11] It is important to emphasize that the Traditional Process and the Streamlined Process both lead to the same result. The only difference is that, under the Streamlined Process, the objection or appeal is carried out collectively through the designated partner whereas under the Traditional Process it is carried out individually by each partner. Thus, while the Streamlined Process is generally more efficient for all parties, both processes allow the Minister to assess the correct tax and both processes ensure that partners have objection and appeal rights.\n[emphasis added]\n[12] If the Minister uses the streamlined process, only the designated member is entitled to dispute the determination by serving a notice of objection on the Minister. Once the objection process has concluded, all partners are bound by the Minister\u2019s redetermination and are subject to assessment or reassessment on that basis within one year.[7]\nThe events leading to the redetermination at issue [13] In computing taxable income for his 2001 taxation year, the Appellant claimed his proportionate share of the Partnership\u2019s loss for its 2001 fiscal period. The Partnership computed its loss for that period as $255,788,405. The Appellant\u2019s proportionate share of that loss was $292,859.[8] In May of 2002, the Minister assessed the Appellant\u2019s 2001 taxation year as filed.[9]\n[14] By notice dated March 30, 2005, the Minister determined the Partnership\u2019s loss for its 2001 fiscal period as $134,913,329 (the \u201cInitial Determination\u201d).[10]\n[15] Under subsection 152(1.4) of the Act, the Initial Determination was binding on all members of the Partnership. In addition, subsection 152(1.6) of the Act provides that a determination made under subsection 154(1.4) binds all partners regardless of whether any particular partner received notice of the determination:\n152(1.4) The Minister may, within 3 years after the day that is the later of\n(a) the day on or before which a member of a partnership is, or but for subsection 220(2.1) would be, required under section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations to make an information return for a fiscal period of the partnership, and\n(b) the day the return is filed,\ndetermine any income or loss of the partnership for the fiscal period and any deduction or other amount, or any other matter, in respect of the partnership for the fiscal period that is relevant in determining the income, taxable income or taxable income earned in Canada of, tax or other amount payable by, or any amount refundable to or deemed to have been paid or to have been an overpayment by, any member of the partnership for any taxation year under this Part.\n152(1.5) Where a determination is made under subsection 152(1.4) in respect of a partnership for a fiscal period, the Minister shall send a notice of the determination to the partnership and to each person who was a member of the partnership during the fiscal period.\n152(1.6) No determination made under subsection 152(1.4) in respect of a partnership for a fiscal period is invalid solely because one or more persons who were members of the partnership during the period did not receive a notice of the determination.\n[16] By Notice of Objection served on June 24, 2005, 1444932 Ontario Limited, as the designated member of the Partnership, objected to the Initial Determination on behalf of the Partnership.[11] On November 15, 2011, the CRA and the Partnership settled the Partnership\u2019s objection for its 2001 fiscal period by entering into minutes of settlement.[12]\n[17] By notice dated April 2, 2012, the Minister redetermined the Partnership\u2019s loss for the 2001 fiscal period as $194,876,572 (the \u201cRedetermination\u201d).[13] The Redetermination reflected the amount of the Partnership\u2019s loss agreed upon by the Partnership and the CRA in their minutes of settlement.\n[18] Paragraph 152(1.7)(a) of the Act made the Redetermination binding on every member of the Partnership. Paragraph 152(1.7)(b) of the Act then allowed the Minister one year from the date on which the Redetermination became final and binding to assess or reassess each partner to give effect to the Redetermination:\n152(1.7) Where the Minister makes a determination under subsection 152(1.4) or a redetermination in respect of a partnership,\n(a)subject to the rights of objection and appeal of the member of the partnership referred to in subsection 165(1.15) in respect of the determination or redetermination, the determination or redetermination is binding on the Minister and each member of the partnership for the purposes of calculating the income, taxable income or taxable income earned in Canada of, tax or other amount payable by, or any amount refundable to or deemed to have been paid or to have been an overpayment by, the members for any taxation year under this Part; and\n(b)notwithstanding subsections 152(4), 152(4.01), 152(4.1) and 152(5), the Minister may, before the end of the day that is one year after the day on which all rights of objection and appeal expire or are determined in respect of the determination or redetermination, assess the tax, interest, penalties or other amounts payable and determine an amount deemed to have been paid or to have been an overpayment under this Part in respect of any member of the partnership and any other taxpayer for any taxation year as may be necessary to give effect to the determination or redetermination or a decision of the Tax Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2001 taxation year [19] By notice dated November 19, 2012, the Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2001 taxation year to reflect his proportionate share of the Partnership\u2019s loss as adjusted by the Redetermination.[14]\n[20] The net effect of the reassessment was to disallow $69,746 of the $292,859 loss the Appellant had claimed from his investment in the Partnership. This resulted in an upward adjustment of the Appellant\u2019s taxable income for his 2001 taxation year to $388,409.[15]\n[21] The Appellant neither pleaded nor argued that the 2001 reassessment reflected anything other than his proportionate share of the Partnership\u2019s loss as redetermined by the Minister.\nThe Appellant\u2019s arguments [22] At trial, the Appellant made five principal arguments:[16]\n1. The Minister should not have accepted 1444932 Ontario Limited as the Appellant\u2019s representative [23] The Appellant contended that evidence of his authorization of 1444932 Ontario Limited as his representative was necessary for the Crown to succeed.\n[24] The Appellant correctly noted that the evidence does not include a power of attorney or any other authorization under which the Appellant appointed 1444932 Ontario Limited as his representative to object to the Initial Determination. Nor does it include an offering memorandum or other document by which the partners of the Partnership, including the Appellant, constituted 1444932 Ontario Limited as their agent for that purpose. Finally, the evidence does not include Form RC59 that would have authorized the CRA to deal with 1444932 Ontario Limited on behalf of the Appellant.[17]\n[25] But in light of the scheme of the Act, as reviewed by this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal in Lux TCC, Tedesco, and Lux FCA, such evidence is unnecessary. When the Minister uses the streamlined process, a partnership that wishes to object to a determination designates or otherwise authorizes one of its members to object on behalf of the partnership. That is the import of subsection 165(1.15) of the Act.\n[26] I find that 1444932 Ontario Limited was (a) designated in the information return made under section 229 of the Income Tax Regulations for the Partnership\u2019s 2001 fiscal period or (b) otherwise authorized by the Partnership to so act. I make that finding on a balance of probabilities in light of the following evidence (the Partnership is also called the \u201cOffering Partnership\u201d in certain documents):\nParagraph 13 of the Partnership\u2019s Notice of Objection (Exhibit R-5):\n13. 1444932 Ontario Limited is the member of the Offering Partnership designated to object to the Minister\u2019s determination for purposes of subsection 165(1.15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).\nParagraphs 5-6 and 14-15 of the Minutes of Settlement between the Partnership and the CRA (Exhibit R-6):\n5. 1444932 Ontario Limited and Hazelton Films GP MMI Inc. are the general partners and designated members [of] the Offering Partnership and the PSLPs, respectively;\n6. On behalf of their respective partnerships, 1444932 Ontario Limited and Hazelton Films GP MMI Inc. objected to the above noted determinations;\n***\n14. 1444932 Ontario Limited and Hazelton Films GP MMI Inc. acknowledge their understanding that, once the Minister has issued the redeterminations reflecting the adjustments described above in paragraph 10, subsection 152(1.7) of the ITA will preclude members of the redetermined partnership from filing a Notice of Objection or otherwise challenging the reassessments of the members that give effect to the redeterminations; and\n15. By way of their counsel\u2019s signature, 1444932 Ontario Limited and Hazelton Films GP MMI Inc. hereby confirm that they are authorized to executive minutes of settlement implementing the settlement agreement contained in these Minutes and that they are executing the Minutes on behalf of their respective partnerships.\nCRA addressed the Notice of Determination to \u201cGrosvenor Services 2001 Limited Partnership c\/o 1444932 Ontario Limited\u201d (Exhibit R-4);\nThe Notice of Objection to the Determination was served on the Minister by \u201cGrosvenor Services 2001 Limited Partnership c\/o 1444932 Ontario Limited\u201d (Exhibit R-6);\nCRA addressed the Notice of Redetermination to \u201cGrosvenor Services 2001 Limited Partnership c\/o 1444932 Ontario Limited\u201d (Exhibit R-7);\nMs. Kaur testified that the CRA considered 1444932 Ontario Limited to be the designated member of the Partnership;[18] and\nMr. Menzies testified that he had no information that 1444932 Ontario Limited was not the designated member of the Partnership.[19]\n[27] Based on all of that evidence, I have concluded that 1444932 Ontario Limited was the \u201cdesignated member\u201d of the Partnership within the meaning of subsection 165(1.15) of the Act.[20]\n2. The Minister should not have taken ten years to reassess the Appellant[21] [28] The Appellant correctly noted that his 2001 taxation year was assessed in the spring of 2002, yet the Minister did not reassess that year until the fall of 2012. He contended that it was unfair and unreasonable for the Minister to take ten years to reassess.\n[29] A complete answer to this argument is found in paragraph 152(1.7)(b) of the Act. That provision allows the Minister one year to reassess from the time that a redetermination becomes final and binding. As the Partnership\u2019s right to object to the April 2, 2012 Redetermination expired on July 2, 2012 and as the Minister reassessed on November 19, 2012 to give effect to the Redetermination, the Minister was well within the one year period provided by paragraph 152(1.7)(b) of the Act.\n3. The Minister had a duty under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to warn the Appellant that the Partnership was a questionable tax scheme[22] [30] The Appellant argued that the Minister had a duty to warn him about the Partnership because it was a \u201cquestionable tax scheme\u201d. In support of his argument, he cited paragraph 14 of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights published by the CRA:\n14. You have the right to expect us to warn you about questionable tax schemes in a timely manner\nYou can expect us to provide you with timely information about questionable tax schemes that are under scrutiny by the CRA. We can only warn you about tax schemes after we become aware of them and have determined that they may be questionable.\n[31] But neither the Appellant nor the Crown suggested that the Partnership was a \u201cquestionable tax scheme\u201d. In any event, this Court has no power to enforce the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. As Justice Graham noted in Johnson v The Queen, 2022 TCC 31:\n[25] The Taxpayer Bill of Rights is an administrative document issued by the CRA. It is, in essence, a pledge to deliver a certain quality of service to Canadian taxpayers. It has no force of law. It neither overrides nor supplements the Income Tax Act.\n***\n[27] A taxpayer cannot sue or otherwise bring an action against the CRA in Tax Court for an alleged breach of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. \u2026\n[28] The mere fact that the Minister may have breached the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is not, in itself, relevant to determining the validity or correctness of the Appellant\u2019s reassessments.\n4. The Minister was required to inform the Appellant why she decided to waive or cancel interest and must produce all documents relating to that decision [32] The Appellant argued that the Minister was required to produce all documents in respect of her decision to waive or cancel 37 months of interest for the period from April 1, 2005 to May 1, 2008 for all members of the Partnership.[23]\n[33] This is a fishing expedition for documents having no relevance to the issues raised in the pleadings. But even if the Appellant had pleaded this as an issue, this Court has no power to review discretionary decisions made by the Minister with respect to waivers or cancellation of interest.[24]\n[34] The Appellant also maintained, on a more general basis, that the Crown deprived him of the right to full documentary discovery prior to trial.[25] If the Appellant had an issue with the extent of the Crown\u2019s documentary disclosure, he could have made a motion to the Court when the issue arose. Without commenting on the merits of his position, it is too late to raise the issue at trial.\n5. The Crown should bear the burden of proof\n[35] The Appellant contended that because all relevant facts are exclusively or peculiarly within the Minister\u2019s knowledge, the Crown should bear the burden of proof. He argued that:\nIn this case, the Appellant has established that all the documents and correspondence \u2026 related to all the issues, save and except the correspondences from it or the tax returns of the Appellant, are the documents of the CRA. So in this case, the burden of proof rests [with] the government, CRA, and not with the taxpayer.[26]\n[36] Contrary to the Appellant\u2019s submissions, this is not a case in which all relevant facts are exclusively or peculiarly within the Minister\u2019s knowledge. The Appellant was a partner in the Partnership. In that capacity, he would have had access to facts and documents relating to the Partnership\u2019s business affairs. If he had difficulty obtaining such facts or documents from the Partnership, that was a matter between him and the Partnership \u2013 not between him and the CRA.\n[37] In any event, there were no facts in issue on the pleadings. The Appellant simply contended that the law precluded the Minister from doing certain things (arguments 1 and 2 above) or that the law required the Minister to do other things (arguments 3 and 4 above). The Appellant\u2019s arguments relate to law, not facts. The Appellant\u2019s position on burden of proof has no merit.\nConclusion\n[38] The Appellant\u2019s appeal of his 2001 reassessment fails. As his 2003 and 2005 reassessments flow directly from his 2001 reassessment, and as he conceded the correctness of his 2011 assessment, the appeals will be dismissed, with costs in accordance with Tariff B of Schedule II to the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction: [1] The appellant, Sean O\u2019Hagan, appeals an assessed penalty of $25,286[1], raised November 15, 2011 per subsection 163(2) of the federal Income Tax Act (Act). A subsection 163(2) penalty is often referred to as a \u201cgross negligence penalty\u201d.\nII. Statutory Provision: [2] Subsection 163(2) reads, in relevant part:\n163(2) False statements or omissions:\nEvery person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201c) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty [of one half of the tax amount at issue]. (underlining added)\nIII. Evidence: [3] The Minister of National Revenue assessed this penalty because of a false statement in the appellant\u2019s 2009 income tax return, filed in May 2010. The false statement was that in 2009 the appellant, i.e. Mr. O\u2019Hagan, had sustained a business loss of $214,176.\n[4] The appellant acknowledges that that was a false statement. But he maintains that he did not, as subsection 163(2) specifies, \u201cknowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d make, participate in, assent to or acquiesce in the making of that false statement. Thus he says that the subsection 163(2) penalty was wrongly assessed.\n[5] The appellant testified as to his educational background, saying he had completed his secondary school education. Subsequently, by 2009 he had experienced a decade or more of manual employment including in house construction and factory work for a car manufacturer. His father, with assistance from him, had prepared his annual income tax returns. Hailstorms in southern Ontario in 2008 prompted commencement of the appellant\u2019s involvement in the business of vehicular \u201cpaintless dent repair\u201d. In mid-2009 he retained an accounting firm \u2013 G.L. Fraser and Associates \u2013 to prepare his 2009 tax return.\n[6] The appellant testified also that in 2009 his friend Pierre recommended that the appellant consult another accounting firm, identified as DSC, that could \u201cdouble check\u201d his return. The appellant testified that he contacted DSC, and met with a DSC representative. He testified that he engaged DSC to \u201cdouble check\u201d his 2009 tax return that the Fraser accounting firm was to prepare.\n[7] However, he ended up signing a 2009 tax return for himself prepared by DSC, dating it May 18, 2010.\n[8] He testified that he was not aware that what he was signing was a tax return.\n[9] In the DSC prepared tax rerun that he signed and was filed accordingly, the term \u201cper:\u201d appears immediately before his signature (which he acknowledged was his) on page 4 of the DSC prepared tax return. But he did not know why that was there. He did not ask anyone. Also the nearby box in the tax return, for \u201cprofessional tax preparers only\u201d identification, had been left blank.\n[10] On page 2 of the return, \u201cgross business income\u201d is shown as $42,074 and \u201cnet business income\u201d is relatively prominently shown as a negative six figure amount being, \u201c-214,176\u201d.\n[11] On page 3 of the return, \u201ctotal income\u201d is shown as a negative amount of \u201c-213,628\u201d; also \u201cnet income\u201d is shown as \u201cNIL\u201d; and also \u201ctaxable income\u201d is shown as \u201cNIL\u201d. On page 4 above the appellant\u2019s signature, \u201cTotal payable\u201d and \u201cBalance owing\u201d are both shown as \u201cNIL\u201d.\n[12] Above the appellant\u2019s signature appears the printed statement: \u201cI certify that the information given on this return, and in any documents, attached is correct, complete, and fully discloses all my income.\u201d Immediately below the appellant\u2019s signature is the printed statement: \u201cIt is a serious offence to make a false return.\u201d\n[13] Additionally, as part of the tax return is a completed CRA form entitled, \u201cStatement of Business or Professional Activities\u201d showing that the appellant\u2019s \u201cReceipts as Agent\u201d were said to be \u201c$42,074\u201d, with expenses stated as being \u201c$256,250.30\u201d, yielding a net loss of a negative amount, being \u201c-214,176.10\u201d.\n[14] Also, attached as the final part of the entire tax return is a completed CRA form entitled \u201cRequest for Loss Carryback\u201d. The appellant signed this too, with the form indicating a requested non-capital loss of $48,184 to be applied to his 2006 year; and a non-capital loss of $80,647 to be applied to his 2007 year; and a non-capital loss of $88,297 to be applied to his 2008 year. The appellant signed this document in the signature box on its second of two pages, together with hand\u2011written date of May 18, 2010. Immediately above the appellant\u2019s signature is the printed statement: \u201cCertification. I certify that the information given on this form is correct and complete.\u201d\n[15] The appellant mailed this signed return including the signed request for loss Carryback back to DSC for filing. He made no enquiries of DSC as to anything about it.\n[16] As noted the appellant submits that he was unaware that what he had signed from DSC was a 2009 tax return and also the accompanying Request for Loss Carryback form. He testified that DSC was only supposed to double check the return that the Fraser accounting firm was preparing. I do not accept either of these statements as true, as noted below.\n[17] As well, he testified that he was working in Alberta during much of 2010 doing hail damage work, and he was not aware of CRA mail sent to his Ontario home address (the only address CRA had for him) including a letter dated November 2, 2010 from CRA auditor Ms. Sawatsky (who also testified), which included a questionnaire for him to complete, to give more information as to the very large business loss reported in his filed 2009 return.\n[18] The questionnaire was never completed. The letter was not responded to. The appellant\u2019s parents, with whom he lived in Ontario, forwarded mail to him in Alberta in 2010 but he says he never saw any mail addressed to him from CRA. He also testified that he was stressed and his life was in \u201cchaos\u201d with all the hail damage work he was doing in Alberta and moving from hotel to hotel in doing so.\n[19] A second return for the appellant\u2019s 2009 year, this one prepared by the Fraser accounting firm, signed by the appellant and dated April 11, 2011, i.e. two years later, was filed at or shortly after that date, then revising the previously claimed business loss, to report instead net business income of $16,141.\n[20] This prompted a proposal letter from CRA auditor Ms. Sawatsky, dated July 26, 201l, proposing that the year be assessed as per the second return but with a subsection 163(2) penalty in light of the false statements in the initial return.\n[21] The appellant was assessed accordingly on November 15, 2011 as had been proposed, which assessment included the herein appealed penalty.\n[22] On January 6, 2012, CRA received a single page notice of objection regarding the said assessment, apparently prepared by DSC and signed by the appellant. It refers to the appellant as the \u201ccestui que trust\u201d and cites the Income Tax War Act, 1917, and makes other irrelevant and non-specific references. The appellant testified that he signed it without reading it, or asking anyone what it means. He agreed that that was similar to what he had done with the DSC return.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Positions: [23] The onus is on the respondent Crown to establish that the appealed penalty assessment is proper. The respondent points to the facts that the appellant signed the 2009 return and as well the accompanying Request for Loss Carryback form, both prepared by DSC, without review of either.\n[24] The respondent also cites the substantial quantum of the claimed loss for carryback to earlier taxation years, being over $200,000, and based on fictional 2009 expenses exceeding $250,000. The respondent submits that the appellant was wilfully blind to the false statements in the DSC prepared return. In this regard there were various circumstances that indicated the need for further enquiry before filing.\n[25] Appellant\u2019s counsel asserts that his client did not recognize that he was signing a tax return when he signed the DSC prepared return that contained the false statement. As well, there is not evidence of wilful blindness as he did not know he was signing a return. He expected the Fraser prepared return to be filed. He said his client put blind faith in the tax advisers, referring to DSC. Counsel said that that is \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cnegligent\u201d, but \u201cblind faith is not in itself grossly negligent.\u201d Gross negligence requires a high degree of negligence.\nV. Legal Principles:\n[26] What legal principles guide the application of subsection 163(2)? In 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) in Wynter v. R.[2] stated that \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cgross negligence\u201d in subsection 163(2) are not conjunctive, and that the respondent need only prove one to impose gross negligence penalties.\n[27] Also, in Wynter, the FCA stated, referencing wilful blindness:[3]\nThere is no question that, while conceptually different, gross negligence and wilful blindness may merge to some extent in their application. A taxpayer who turns a blind eye to the truth and accuracy of statements made in their income tax return is wilfully blind, and is also grossly negligent. (underlining added)\n[28] The classic description of gross negligence for a tax penalty is found in the 1984 Federal Court Trial Division decision of Venne v. R.[4] by Strayer J. as he then was. It was approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in Guindon v. Canada[5] as follows:\n\u2018Gross negligence\u2019 must be taken to involve greater neglect than simply a failure to use reasonable care. It must involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, and indifference as to whether the law is complied with or not.\n[29] Also, factors that a court may consider in determining whether a taxpayer was grossly negligent include but are not limited to, the magnitude of the omission, the opportunity the taxpayer had to detect the error, the taxpayer\u2019s education and intelligence, and a genuine effort to comply.[6]\n[30] Further, a taxpayer\u2019s general knowledge of business and tax matters is relevant when determining the requisite degree of negligence.[7]\n[31] In Torres v. R.[8], C. Miller J. of this Court discussed wilful blindness in respect of subsection 163(2) penalties. He accepted that wilful blindness can impute knowledge as well as constitute gross negligence. He identified various \u201cwarning signs\u201d that indicate a need or a suspicion for an enquiry, including:\na. \u201cmagnitude of the advantage\u201d. In the present case the magnitude of the sought advantage is substantial, being a full refund for the 2009 taxation year plus loss carryback requests for three previous years totalling $217,128;\nb. \u201cblatantness of false statement - readily detectable\u201d. Here the readily detectable false statements in the filed tax return were the $256,250 business expense claim and the claimed business loss of $214,176, both readily detectable;\nc. \u201ctax preparer does not acknowledge preparing return\u201d. Here the DSC tax preparer did not self-identify in the space provided in the tax return for doing so, which space was adjacent to the space for the taxpayer\u2019s signature;\nd. \u201ctax preparer makes unusual requests\u201d. The DSC tax preparer requested the appellant to obtain copies of returns for several prior years, which he did, stating his belief that these were for the tax preparer to also \u201cdouble check\u201d. This is not a usual request;\ne. \u201ctax preparer previously unknown to taxpayer\u201d. It is surely the case here that the DSC tax preparer was previously unknown to the appellant;\nf. \u201cexplanation by tax preparer regarding false statement is incomprehensible\u201d. That is consistent with the appellant\u2019s admission in his Notice of Appeal, para. (c) that he \u201cdid not understand the technical filing position taken by the tax return preparers\u201d.\n[32] In Bhatti v. R.[9], which preceded Torres, Justice Miller, in addressing whether an assessment of a subsection 163(2) penalty was well founded, wrote:\nIt is simply insufficient to say I did not review my returns. Blindly entrusting your affairs to another without even a minimal amount of verifying the correctness of the return goes beyond carelessness. So, even if [the taxpayer] did not knowingly make a false omission, [the taxpayer] certainly displayed the cavalier attitude of not caring one way or the other. (underlining added)\n[33] In Paul Lauzon v. Her Majesty, 2016 FCA 298, the FCA addressed whether a subsection 163(2) penalty was appropriate where false business losses had been claimed. In this matter a deduction of $308,073 was claimed, with a loss carryback request that would have allowed for refund of the taxpayer\u2019s entire tax for the years 2005 to 2008. The losses claimed were totally fictitious, having been made up by the tax return preparer from Fiscal Arbitrators.\n[34] The FCA dismissed the appeal, upholding the Tax Court\u2019s denial of the appeal. In so doing the FCA referenced para. 4 of its decision in Strachan v. R.[10], as to the legal test for determining gross negligence in respect of subsection 163(2) penalties:\nGross negligence may be established, where a taxpayer is wilfully blind to the relevant facts, in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for some inquiry, but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know the truth\u2026\n[35] In Nesbitt v. Her Majesty[11], the FCA per Strayer J.A. observed that, \u201c[w]hether or not there is misrepresentation through neglect or carelessness in the completion of a return is determinable at the time the return is filed.\u201d\n[36] In my view this logic applies equally to false statements or omissions within the meaning of subsection 163(2) of the Act. That is, whether such false statements or omissions in a return justify a subsection 163(2) penalty is determinable at the time the return is filed.\n[37] Accordingly, I do not consider evidence heard that post-dates the filing of the 2009 return containing the false statement is of relevance to the matter of whether or not the herein appealed penalty was properly assessed.\nVI. Analysis: [38] Upon consideration of the above cited evidence and jurisprudence I have concluded that this appeal should be dismissed.\n[39] The appellant admits he signed both the DSC return and the accompanying Request for Loss Carryback form without reviewing same before signing. As well, this was despite the printed caution within the signature box for these forms that the signature certifies the truth of the information in the document.\n[40] Also, there was no suitable explanation for why the return 2009 taxation year prepared by the Fraser accounting firm was not signed and filed, as opposed to the DSC return. Additionally, there was no explanation for why, if DSC had been engaged to \u201cdouble check\u201d any Fraser accounting firm prepared returns, the appellant instead signed a return prepared by DSC.\n[41] Also, I do not accept appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s submission that the appellant was unaware that he was signing a tax return, when he signed the tax return that DSC had prepared, together with the accompanying Request for Loss Carryback form. The appellant had full secondary school education. Also, he had been out in the working world for at least a decade or more by early 2010 when he was readying to file his 2009 return.\n[42] Also, I do not accept the appellant\u2019s testimony that DSC said it would simply \u201cdouble check\u201d the Fraser firm\u2019s return prepared for the appellant. I believe the appellant did have discussion with DSC about obtaining a tax refund and that DSC would prepare the return to be filed, as was in fact done. DSC would not have prepared a tax return that the appellant readily signed if otherwise.\n[43] In fact, in the appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal at para. (c), it is pleaded (which could be taken as admissions), that \u201c[t]he tax preparers represented that they had a tax plan that would result in refunds [sic] for the 2009 taxation year.\u201d And, as additionally pleaded, \u201c[t]he tax return preparers sent two documents to the Appellant. The Appellant signed and returned the two documents to the tax return preparers. The tax return preparers filed the Appellant\u2019s 2009 tax return.\u201d\n[44] In my view that is what happened here.\n[45] These factors apply in this case. Any let alone all should have prompted the appellant to enquire regarding the tax documents he was being asked to sign, which he should have done in any event. However, by his own admission the appellant simply signed the documents without any review, or any enquiry made to the DSC tax return preparers.\n[46] The presence of the various red flags identified in Torres substantially contributes to the degree of negligence inherent in making the false statement that in 2009 the appellant had incurred a business loss of $214,176. The appellant would readily know this was not the case. He actually had a net business income of $16,141 as subsequently reported two years later upon the filing of the Fraser firm\u2019s prepared return for 2009.\n[47] The above-noted Torres factors each signal a need for the appellant to first review the prepared tax return and related Request for Loss Carryback, to ensure their correctness, rather than signing the two documents without any review. Nevertheless, the appellant made no effort, however cursory, to verify the accuracy and completeness of his return before singing same,\n[48] The appellant\u2019s complete failure to review or inquire, in the presence of these several Torres factors signaling the need for review or inquiry, constitutes in my view wilful blindness well sufficient to establish gross negligence for subsection 163(2) purposes. Of note, our tax system in Canada is based on accurate self-reporting and self-assessing.\nVII. Conclusion: [49] I conclude that the subject subsection 163(2) penalty was rightly assessed. Gross negligence through wilful blindness is here established where the taxpayer has signed the prepared tax return without any effort at all to first look over the return.\n[50] Factors that aggravate this situation are that the appellant is reasonably well educated and had business experience. As well, this was the first time the appellant had engaged DSC. Also, DSC did not self-identify in the return as the tax preparer, notwithstanding the box for doing so, adjacent to the taxpayer\u2019s signature box, where the appellant signed. Yet this prompted no enquiry from the appellant.\n[51] The appellant claimed he did not recognize that he was signing a tax return. As stated above, this I disbelieve. The appellant has on multiple occasions over the years, as a reasonably educated and business experienced adult, signed his own tax returns. Surely someone who has completed secondary school education can identify a tax return. And if truly he did not know what it was, would not that have been all the more reason to look more closely at the document to determine what the document was (which also may have led him to the several false statements therein).\n[52] I conclude that the appellant, under circumstances of wilful blindness amounting to gross negligence, made or acquiesced in the making of a false statement in a return. Accordingly, this appeal of the assessed subsection 163(2) penalty will be dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 2nd day of May 2023.\n\u201cB.

INTRODUCTION [1] These Reasons pertain to the Appeals by 0808498 BC Ltd. (the \u201cCorporation\u201d) in respect of a decision (the \u201cDecision\u201d) issued on April 5, 2019, by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d), on behalf of the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d), under the Canada Pension Plan (the \u201cCPP\u201d) and the Employment Insurance Act (the \u201cEIA\u201d). The Decision held that the Intervener, Nathan Dahlen, had been hired by the Corporation as an employee, and not as an independent contractor (as the Corporation had intended and understood).\nII. FACTS A. Particulars of Work\n[2] The Corporation is owned by holding companies owned by three cousins, Peter Skov, Jens Skov and Rolly Skov, who are also the three directors of the Corporation. The Corporation is a real estate developer, which, in 2016, commenced the development of a 23-unit townhouse project in Ladner, British Columbia. Being a small developer, the Corporation contracted with UPA Construction Group Canada Limited (\u201cUPA\u201d) to construct the townhouse complex.\n[3] UPA was the general contractor. Its project coordinator was Richard Nasadyck. UPA\u2019s site superintendent for the townhouse project was Dan Chilton.[1] The directors of the Corporation usually communicated with Mr. Nasadyck, rather than Mr. Chilton. The Corporation did not provide directions to Mr. Chilton.[2]\n[4] The various trades (for example, plumbing, electrical and drywall) which worked on the project were sourced by the general contractor (i.e., UPA) and approved by the developer (i.e., the Corporation). All of the trades were subcontracted by UPA; none of them were employed by the Corporation.\n[5] After graduating from high school, Mr. Dahlen embarked on a heavy duty mechanic apprenticeship program. Due to a lack of work, in November 2016 Mr. Dahlen was laid off by the operator of the truck stop where he had been working. Anxious to find work, Mr. Dahlen posted on Facebook a message indicating that he was looking for work. Mr. Dahlen knew the daughter of Jens Skov and spoke with her about his search for work. She spoke with her father, who spoke with Peter and Rolly, and a decision was made by them for the Corporation to extend a work opportunity to Mr. Dahlen.\n[6] Jens Skov spoke with Mr. Dahlen and explained that the Corporation was looking to hire a construction safety officer (a \u201cCSO\u201d) and first-aid attendant. Jens told Mr. Dahlen that, if he successfully completed a one-week Occupational First Aid Level 2 course, the Corporation would reimburse the cost of the course ($640) and would then hire him as a CSO at the townhouse jobsite. Mr. Dahlen paid the $640 fee for the course on December 1, 2016, and was reimbursed for that amount by the Corporation on December 2, 2016.[3] Mr. Dahlen attended the course from December 5 to December 9, 2016.\n[7] During their initial conversation, Jens told Mr. Dahlen that the Corporation would not employ him, but rather, would put him on a contract, such that he would be responsible for his own taxes, employment insurance (\u201cEI\u201d) premiums and CPP contributions.[4]\n[8] Mr. Dahlen commenced work for the Corporation on December 13, 2016. On December 20, 2016, Peter Skov wrote a cheque, drawn on the Corporation\u2019s account at a credit union, in the amount of $480, to cover the compensation for Mr. Dahlen\u2019s work from December 13 through 16 inclusive. Jens Skov delivered the cheque to Mr. Dahlen\u2019s residence and there spoke with both Mr. Dahlen and his mother, D. Elizabeth (Liz) Dahlen. During that conversation, Jens reminded Mr. Dahlen that he should set aside money from each cheque to pay his taxes when he filed his income tax return.[5]\n[9] After that meeting, Ms. Dahlen assisted Mr. Dahlen in arranging for a significant portion of his compensation cheques to be deposited into a joint bank account which they had, to ensure that there would be sufficient funds to pay the tax liability.[6]\n[10] One of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s responsibilities at the jobsite was to ensure that the regulations and rules of the Workers Compensation Board (the \u201cWCB\u201d) were followed on the site. For instance, he was required to ensure that no one was allowed on the site unless that person was wearing steel-toed boots, a safety vest and a hard hat. Mr. Dahlen also needed to ensure that there were never more than 50 workers on the site (as that would result in a different classification for WCB purposes).[7] In this role, Mr. Dahlen regularly checked with the subcontractors (such as framers, roofers, electricians, plumbers and the like) to inquire as to how many workers each subtrade would have on site at a particular time. As well, Mr. Dahlen regularly walked or patrolled the jobsite to observe the work that was being done and to ensure that proper safety standards were being followed. For instance, if he noticed a roofer who was not wearing fall\u2011restraint gear, Mr. Dahlen would bring that to the attention of the roofer.\n[11] For the first week or so of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s work at the jobsite, Mr. Chilton, on behalf of UPA, showed Mr. Dahlen what to do and often accompanied him as he learned and performed his duties. Mr. Chilton provided Mr. Dahlen with a clipboard and the WCB forms that were to be completed on a regular basis.[8]\n[12] If a worker was injured on the jobsite, Mr. Dahlen administered first aid. There were relatively few injuries, so Mr. Dahlen did not spend a great deal of time administering first aid. The most serious incident that he faced occurred near the end of the construction project, when a tow truck driver came to remove the trailer that had been used as a construction office and first-aid station. The tow truck driver needed to reseat the beads on the tires.[9] To carry out the procedure, the driver wrapped a ratchet strap around the circumference of the particular tire and tightened the strap so as to compress the tire and press the tire\u2019s sidewalls against the rim to create a seal. As the driver was working on the second tire, the teeth on the ratchet strap kicked back and made a large gash in the driver\u2019s arm. Mr. Dahlen treated that wound and directed the driver to the hospital to obtain stitches.[10]\n[13] As the safety officer, Mr. Dahlen was needed on the jobsite throughout the working day. However, his actual safety and first-aid duties did not occupy the entirety of the working day. Therefore, he was often asked by Mr. Chilton or various subtrades to assist with projects that needed \u201can extra set of hands.\u201d\n[14] Four other young men were also hired by the Corporation to work at the jobsite. One was Peter\u2019s son, one was Jens\u2019 son and the other two were friends of Jens\u2019 son. They were still in school, so they did not work at the jobsite to the same extent as Mr. Dahlen. Those four young men were similarly advised by Jens and\/or Peter that they would be working on a contract basis, rather than an employment basis. Peter\u2019s son was hired as a CSO.[11] The other three young men were hired as labourers.\n[15] Peter Skov explained that, in 2017, there was a shortage of workers in the construction industry, such that general contractors and subcontractors were having difficulty hiring workers. As well, some of the workers who were hired would quit partway through the job, and move to some other job. From time to time, UPA hired workers through Workforce Staffing Solution Ltd. (\u201cWorkforce\u201d), but those workers were often unreliable, sometimes coming to the jobsite in the morning but leaving before the work day had concluded. This was troubling because Workforce charged a fee to UPA for the entire day\u2019s work, even though the particular worker may have been there only part of the day. That was one of the reasons for which the Corporation hired the three young men who were not safety officers. Those young men were available on the jobsite to assist the general contractor and subcontractors, as needed.[12]\n[16] Mr. Dahlen had a dream to become a Red Seal heavy-duty mechanic in a longshoreman position. While working for the Corporation, he applied for, and obtained, a longshoreman position with BC Maritime Employers Association. In anticipation of commencing work at the new position, and before terminating his work at the townhouse project, it was necessary for Mr. Dahlen to go for training and other functions related to the new position. On those days when Mr. Dahlen attended the longshoreman training and related functions, rather than going to work at the townhouse project, he notified Mr. Chilton, who (if necessary) arranged for another safety officer, provided under a contract with Workforce, to attend and be present at the jobsite.[13] During his cross-examination, Jens Skov referred to that hiring agency as \u201cManpower\u201d. He stated that UPA made the arrangements for, and paid, Manpower (i.e., Workforce) to provide temporary occupational health and safety officers, as well as general labourers. UPA then billed the Corporation, whereupon the Corporation paid to UPA the amount of the fee charged by Workforce.[14]\n[17] By the summer of 2017 the construction of the townhouses was nearing completion, which meant that there was reduced construction activity on the site. The few remaining workers were primarily doing finishing work.\n[18] In or about August 2017, Jens Skov advised Mr. Dahlen that the construction of the townhouses was complete, such that his services would no longer be required. Mr. Dahlen\u2019s last day of work for the Corporation was August 15, 2017.[15]\nB. Income Tax Reporting\n[19] Sometime in early 2017, the Corporation issued to Mr. Dahlen a Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income (Form T4A) (the \u201c2016 T4A slip\u201d), showing the amount of the compensation that had been paid to him by the Corporation in 2016.[16] As Mr. Dahlen had worked for the Corporation for only a portion of December 2016, the amount shown on the 2016 T4A slip was relatively modest, namely $1,290.\n[20] Ms. Dahlen attempted to prepare Mr. Dahlen\u2019s 2016 income tax return, but encountered difficulty because she did not know how to deal with the 2016 T4A slip. Up until then, she had had experience only with T4 slips. After considerable frustration with her tax-preparation software, she asked Mr. Dahlen to speak to Jens Skov, who spoke to Peter Skov, who is a chartered accountant in private practice. Peter Skov advised that he would complete the 2016 income tax return for Mr. Dahlen, which he did.[17] The 2016 income tax return prepared by Peter Skov and filed by Mr. Dahlen with the CRA showed his employment income from his previous jobs in 2016 on line 101 of that return, and showed his compensation, in the amount of $1,290, from the Corporation, on lines 162 and 135, where it was described as \u201cSelf-employment income -- Business Income.\u201d The gross amount and the net amount were the same, i.e., $1,290.[18] Mr. Dahlen testified that he did not review his 2016 income tax return before he filed it.[19]\n[21] In February 2018, the Corporation issued to Mr. Dahlen a Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income (Form T4A) for 2017 (the \u201c2017 T4A slip\u201d), showing \u201cFees for services\u201d in the amount of $21,439.[20]\n[22] Ms. Dahlen prepared Mr. Dahlen\u2019s 2017 income tax return, without consulting, or requesting the services of, Peter Skov. The copy of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s 2017 income tax return put into evidence was not signed or dated.[21] It is my understanding that Mr. Dahlen reported his 2017 compensation from the Corporation as employment income on line 101 of the return, rather than as self-employment income -- business income on lines 162 and 135 of the return.\n[23] In or about September 2018, having determined that Mr. Dahlen had been an employee of the Corporation, rather than an independent contractor, the CRA prepared a T4 slip showing his compensation as employment income, rather than self-employment or business income. The CRA provided a copy of that T4 slip to the Corporation, after which the Corporation sent a copy thereof to Mr. Dahlen, accompanied by a letter dated September 10, 2018.[22] On or about September 14, 2018, Ms. Dahlen sent a T1 Adjustment Request to the CRA, together with a copy of the T4 slip that the CRA had prepared.[23]\nC. Employment Insurance Proceedings\n[24] In early 2018, Mr. Dahlen attended the British Columbia Institute of Technology to continue his heavy mechanical trades apprenticeship.[24] At that time he applied for EI benefits, and learned that his period of work with the Corporation was not considered to have been insurable employment.[25] On March 19, 2018, he requested a ruling from the CPP\/EI Rulings Division of the CRA, to determine whether his work with the Corporation was insurable employment.[26]\n[25] By letters dated June 25, 2018, the Rulings Division issued a ruling (the \u201cRuling\u201d), informing Mr. Dahlen and the Corporation that it had been determined that Mr. Dahlen was an employee of the Corporation and that his employment was insurable.[27] On August 16, 2018, the Corporation appealed to the Minister from the Ruling.[28] By letters dated April 5, 2019, the Minister issued the Decision to Mr. Dahlen and the Corporation, stating that Mr. Dahlen\u2019s employment with the Corporation was insurable.[29] The Corporation appealed from the Decision to this Court.\nIII. ISSUE [26] The issue in these Appeals is whether Mr. Dahlen was hired by, and worked for, the Corporation as an employee.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Reliability of Evidence\n[27] Apart from the question of the intention of the parties concerning Mr. Dahlen\u2019s status, the evidence given by Jens Skov, Peter Skov and Ms. Dahlen contained a couple of other inconsistencies, as follows:\na) According to Ms. Dahlen, when Jens Skov delivered Mr. Dahlen\u2019s initial compensation cheque to the Dahlen home, Jens told Mr. Dahlen and Ms. Dahlen that the Corporation was not set up with a payroll account, such that the Corporation would not withhold income tax, so Mr. Dahlen \u201cneeded to pay his own income tax.\u201d[30] However, when discussing the hiring of his son, Jens\u2019 son and the two other young men, Peter Skov stated that not wanting to deal with the responsibility of payroll was not the reason for which those four young men were hired as independent contractors.[31]\nb)Jens stated that, from the perspective of the Corporation, it was not part of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s duties to meet and unload deliveries to the jobsite.[32] However, in discussing the work performed by the four young men who were hired (in addition to Mr. Dahlen), Peter Skov stated that one of their functions was to unload appliances and other items that were delivered to the jobsite.[33] Nevertheless, this might not be a discrepancy, given that the work responsibilities of Mr. Dahlen and the other four young men, while similar, were not necessarily identical.\n[28] A number of circumstances raised questions in my mind concerning the reliability of some of the evidence given by Mr. Dahlen:\na) During the direct examination of Mr. Dahlen, he was asked by his agent, Ms. Dahlen, whether he had had a conversation with someone before he began to work at the construction site. Mr. Dahlen said that he did not know, even after a follow-up question from Ms. Dahlen. Eventually, however, Mr. Dahlen acknowledged that he had had a conversation about first-aid training.[34]\nb) In giving his account of the meeting with Jens Skov, where the nature of the work arrangement was discussed, Mr. Dahlen stated that his understanding of the meeting was that he would need to set aside money to pay any \u201cextra taxes\u201d (his phrase) that might arise. He went on to indicate that he did not think that he would have to pay any taxes on the compensation paid to him by the Corporation, but that something might arise that could result in extra taxes. Mr. Dahlen acknowledged that he did not remember whether in his initial meeting with Jens Skov, Jens used the term \u201cextra taxes\u201d or whether he simply said that Mr. Dahlen would be responsible for his taxes.[35]\nc) Although Mr. Dahlen\u2019s 2016 income tax return reported that the compensation paid by the Corporation was income from self-employment or business income, Mr. Dahlen said that he was not aware of the manner in which such compensation had been reported, that he did not have any knowledge that Peter Skov had prepared the 2016 income tax return in that manner, and that he had not reviewed his income tax return before it was filed with the CRA.[36] In fact, he wasn\u2019t even sure if he had signed his 2016 income tax return.[37]\nd) While discussing the preparation and contents of his 2016 income tax return, Mr. Dahlen stated that he did not know anything about taxes and that he outsourced all of his tax matters.[38] Only later did Mr. Dahlen state that, apart from the tax return prepared by Peter Skov, it was actually Mr. Dahlen\u2019s mother who had prepared his tax returns.[39] While that likely constitutes outsourcing, I was left wondering whether Mr. Dahlen was trying to hold something back from me, rather than giving his evidence openly and forthrightly.\ne) When asked if Peter Skov had prepared Mr. Dahlen\u2019s 2017 income tax return, Mr. Dahlen initially said that Peter had done so, whereupon Ms. Dahlen interjected to state that she was the one who had prepared and filed Mr. Dahlen\u2019s tax returns, except for the 2016 return, which Peter had prepared and filed.[40] Mr. Dahlen\u2019s initial, but incorrect, statement that his 2017 tax return had been prepared by Peter Skov raises questions about the reliability of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s recollection of events in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n[29] There were certain circumstances that caused me to wonder about the evidence given by Ms. Dahlen:\na)Throughout the hearing, it was apparent that Ms. Dahlen was harbouring ill will and possibly animosity toward the Corporation and its directors.[41] While this is not impermissible and is perhaps understandable, it also raises the question as to whether such feelings may have coloured her recollection of events, or whether her evidence and Mr. Dahlen\u2019s evidence may have been orchestrated.\nb)Ms. Dahlen stated that, after the meeting in December 2016, when Jens Skov had brought Mr. Dahlen\u2019s first compensation cheque to his home and had met with Mr. Dahlen and Ms. Dahlen, she did not want Mr. Dahlen to work for the Corporation, and she felt that Mr. Dahlen should terminate his work with the Corporation.[42] However, she acknowledged that Mr. Dahlen liked working on the townhouse project because the jobsite was close to the Dahlen residence and because Mr. Dahlen had a sense of responsibility and importance as the safety officer on the site.[43]\nc) The impression I received is that Ms. Dahlen felt that the Corporation was trying to cheat her son or to take advantage of him. For instance, in her cross-examination of Peter Skov, she insinuated that the Corporation had hired the four additional young men so as to ensure that Mr. Dahlen\u2019s compensation would not exceed the $30,000 small-supplier threshold under the Excise Tax Act, such that Mr. Dahlen would not need to register under that legislation, nor would he need to collect the goods and services tax (the \u201cGST\u201d) from the Corporation in respect of the compensation paid by the Corporation to him.[44] This insinuation is unfounded, as the total compensation paid in 2017 to all five of the young men hired by the Corporation was $28,894.[45] As well, Ms. Dahlen suggested to Jens Skov that the Corporation was underpaying her son.[46] When cross-examining Peter Skov, Ms. Dahlen implied that not all of the five young men (i.e., Mr. Dahlen and the four others) were treated the same, and suggested that some were awarded more hours than others, which Peter denied.[47] My sense during the hearing was that Ms. Dahlen was trying to redress what she perceived to be a wrong done by the Corporation to her son.\nB. Statutory Provisions\n[30] From a statutory perspective, one of the questions to be resolved in these Appeals is whether, from December 13, 2016 to August 15, 2017, Mr. Dahlen was employed in insurable employment. For the purposes of these Appeals, the relevant provision of the statutory definition of insurable employment is found in paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA, which reads as follows:\n5(1) Subject to subsection (2) [which is not relevant here], insurable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise; \u2026\n[31] Another relevant question is whether Mr. Dahlen was employed by the Corporation in pensionable employment. In 2016 and 2017, subsections 2(1) and 6(1) of the CPP (when read together) defined pensionable employment as follows:\n2(1) In this Act, \u2026\npensionable employment means employment specified in subsection 6(1); \u2026\n6(1) Pensionable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada that is not excepted employment;\n(b) employment in Canada under Her Majesty in right of Canada that is not excepted employment; or\n(c) employment included in pensionable employment by a regulation made under section 7.\nSubsection 6(2) of the CPP defines the term excepted employment. None of the provisions of that definition is applicable here.\n[32] As is abundantly clear from the above statutory definitions, for there to be insurable employment or pensionable employment, there must first be employment.\nC. Jurisprudence: Employee or Independent Contractor?\n[33] Although there is no universal test for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, the \u201ccentral question is whether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business on his own account.\u201d[48] In making such determination, the following factors should generally be considered:\na) Does the hirer control the worker\u2019s activities?\nb) Does the hirer provide the tools and equipment required by the worker, or is the worker required to provide his or her own tools and equipment?\nc) Does the worker hire his or her own helpers?\nd) What is the degree of financial risk taken by the worker? In other words, does the worker have a risk of loss?\ne) What is the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker?\nf) Does the worker have an opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks?[49]\nThere is no set formula concerning the application of the above factors, which is a non-exhaustive list.[50]\n[34] In recent times, the courts have noted the importance of considering the stated intention of the parties (i.e., the hirer and the worker) in determining whether the worker is an employee or an independent contractor. The role of intention was explained by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes in this manner:\n30 Alongside the test as set out in Weibe Door and Sagaz, in the past few years another jurisprudential trend has emerged which affords substantial weight to the stated intention of the parties: Wolf v. The Queen, 2002 D.T.C. 6053 (F.C.A.) \u2026; Royal Winnipeg Ballet v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue) 2006 FCA 87\u2026.\n33 As a result, Royal Winnipeg Ballet stands for the proposition that what must first be considered is whether there is a mutual understanding or common intention between the parties regarding their relationship. Where such a common intention is found, be it as independent contractor or employee, the test set out in Wiebe Door is then to be applied by considering the relevant factors in light of that mutual intent for the purpose of determining if, on balance, the relevant facts support and are consistent with the common intent\u2026.\n38 Consequently, Wolf and Royal Winnipeg Ballet set out a two step process of inquiry that is used to assist in addressing the central question, as established in Sagaz and Wiebe Door, which is to determine whether the individual is performing or not the services as his own business on his own account.\n39 Under the first step, the subjective intent of each party to the relationship must be ascertained. This can be determined either by the written contractual relationship the parties have entered into or by the actual behaviour of each party, such as invoices for services rendered, registration for GST purposes and income tax filings as an independent contractor.\n40 The second step is to ascertain whether an objective reality sustains the subjective intent of the parties. As noted by Sharlow J.A. in TBT Personnel Services Inc. v. Canada, 2011 FCA 256, \u2026 at para. 9, \u201cit is also necessary to consider the Wiebe Door factors to determine whether the facts are consistent with the parties\u2019 expressed intention.\u201d In other words, the subjective intent of the parties cannot trump the reality of the relationship as ascertained through objective facts. In this second step, the parties[\u2019] intent as well as the terms of the contract may also be taken into account since they colors [sic] the relationship. As noted in Royal Winnipeg Ballet at para. 64, the relevant factors must be considered \u201cin the light of\u201d the parties\u2019 intent. However, that being stated, the second step is an analysis of the pertinent facts for the purpose of determining whether the test set out in Wiebe Door and Sagaz has been in fact met, i.e[.,] whether the legal effect of the relationship the parties have established is one of independent contractor or of employer-employee.\n41 The central question at issue remains whether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is, in actual fact, performing them as a person in business on his own account. As stated in both Wiebe Door and Sagaz, in making this determination no particular factor is dominant and there is no set formula. The factors to consider will thus vary with the circumstances. Nevertheless, the specific factors discussed in Wiebe Door and Sagaz will usually be relevant, such as the level of control over the worker\u2019s activities, whether the worker provides his own equipment, hires his helpers, manages and assumes financial risks, and has an opportunity of profit in the performance of his tasks\u2026.\n42 \u2026 The first step of the analysis should always be to determine at the outset the intent of the parties and then, using the prism of that intent, determining in a second step whether the parties\u2019 relationship, as reflected in objective reality, is one of employer-employee or of independent contractor.[51]\n[35] In Insurance Institute of Ontario, while considering the application of the two steps in the analysis set out in Connor Homes, Justice Graham focused specifically on whether the result of the first step affects the application of the test in the second step. He concluded \u201cthat intention must be relevant when the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors indicate that the relationship is one thing but the parties intended it to be another thing and their relationship is similar to what they intended.\u201d[52] Concerning the application of the second step, Justice Graham stated:\n26. Based on all of the foregoing, I conclude that the second step of the Connor Homes test should be applied as follows:\na)Where the payor and the worker do not share a common intention, their relationship will be the relationship indicated by the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors.\nb)Where the payor and the worker share a common intention:\nif the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are consistent with that common intention, then their relationship will be the relationship that they intended;\nif the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are completely inconsistent with that common intention, then their relationship will be the relationship indicated by those factors; and\nif the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are inconsistent with that common intention but the parties nonetheless act and carry on their relationship in a manner that is similar to what one would expect from their intentions, then their relationship will be the relationship that they intended.[53]\nD. Two-Step Analysis\n[36] Following the guidance set out in Connor Homes, I will first consider whether there was a mutual understanding or common intention between the Corporation and Mr. Dahlen regarding their relationship. I will then consider the factors identified in Sagaz and Wiebe Door in light of such mutual intent (if any) for the purpose of:\na) determining if, on balance, the relevant facts sustain and are consistent with such intent, or\nb) if there is not a mutual intent, determining whether those factors point to employment or independent contract.\nE. Intention\n[37] It is clear that Peter Skov and Jens Skov, as directors of the Corporation, intended and understood that the Corporation was hiring Mr. Dahlen as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. For instance, they indicated that the Corporation did not have any employees, and Jens may have said to Mr. Dahlen and Ms. Dahlen that the Corporation was not set up to operate a payroll system for employees.\n[38] Peter Skov and Jens Skov were of the understanding that all five young men had been hired on a similar basis. It seems that the four other young men did not question their status as independent contractors.[54]\n[39] It is more difficult to ascertain the intention or understanding of Mr. Dahlen about the relationship that he had with the Corporation. During his testimony, he stated adamantly that he had been an employee, that he had not been self-employed, and that he did not have a business. When confronted with the entries on lines 162 and 135 of his 2016 income tax return, he disavowed those entries, and said that they had been made without his knowledge or instruction.\n[40] Both Mr. Dahlen and Ms. Dahlen were of the understanding that Jens Skov had said to them that the Corporation was not set up to operate a payroll system, and that Mr. Dahlen would be responsible for his taxes. As advised by Jens, Mr. Dahlen set aside money to pay income tax.[55]\n[41] According to Jens Skov, Mr. Dahlen was hired to provide first aid and to perform other duties as he saw fit. Mr. Dahlen had discretion in organizing his work, and he was free to work for other subcontractors who were on the jobsite, without communicating with the Corporation.[56] He did not report directly to the Corporation.[57] In fact, according to Jens Skov, Mr. Dahlen \u201cdid not communicate [regularly] with \u2026 0808498,\u201d[58] and \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t report to anybody other than himself,\u201d[59] not even to Mr. Chilton.[60]\n[42] Jens Skov stated that, in the summer of 2017, when Mr. Dahlen was being trained for a longshoreman position, he would sometimes be absent from the jobsite for days at a time, without having to check in with the Corporation and without having to ask permission to leave the jobsite.[61]\n[43] In any event, it was evident that, at the time of the hearing, there was a difference of opinion between Mr. Dahlen and the Corporation as to the nature of his past relationship with the Corporation. During his testimony, Mr. Dahlen said that he believed that he first realized in April 2017 (when it was time to prepare his 2016 income tax return) that he and the Corporation had different views of the nature of their relationship. However, he did not engage in any conversation with either Peter Skov or Jens Skov to discuss such misunderstanding.[62]\n[44] It is possible that Mr. Dahlen\u2019s intention and understanding of his relationship with the Corporation in April 2017 may not have been the same as his understanding and intention in December 2016, when he began to work for the Corporation. It is also possible that, although he might not have intended to be an independent contractor, his actual intention may have corresponded to a relationship somewhere on the continuum between employment and independent contractor status (which will be discussed below).\n[45] While it is abundantly clear that, at the time of the hearing, Mr. Dahlen was firmly of the view that his intention and understanding were that he had been an employee of the Corporation, I cannot determine whether that was also his intention and understanding in December 2016, when he began to work for the Corporation, or whether his intention and understanding in December 2016 might actually have been otherwise. Given my inability to ascertain Mr. Dahlen\u2019s intention and understanding in December 2016, I will conduct the remainder of my analysis on the basis that the Corporation and Mr. Dahlen did not share a common intention, with the result that we are within subparagraph 26(a), rather than 26(b), of Justice Graham\u2019s analysis in Insurance Institute.[63]\nF. Other Factors\n[46] As indicated in Wiebe Door, Sagaz and the other cases discussed above, there are several additional factors to be considered in determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, as listed in paragraph 33 above.\n1. Control [47] The evidence established that the Corporation did not control the performance by Mr. Dahlen of his work-related duties. To the extent that Mr. Dahlen was subject to any control, that control came from Mr. Chilton (who was UPA\u2019s site superintendent),[64] and not from the Corporation. This is consistent with the fact that, as the general contractor, UPA was in charge of the construction site and all the people on that site.[65]\n[48] Mr. Dahlen stated that he had been told by Jens Skov, apparently when Mr. Dahlen commenced to work at the jobsite, that the person to whom he was to report was Mr. Chilton.[66] However Peter Skov indicated that Mr. Dahlen was not referred to UPA for supervision and direction on the jobsite. Rather, he could assist any of the workers on the site.[67]\n[49] Mr. Dahlen indicated that, if he didn\u2019t know what to do, or how to do it, he asked Mr. Chilton. If Mr. Chilton did not know, Mr. Dahlen sought guidance from one of the finishing carpenters or another worker.[68] Sometimes, when Mr. Chilton knew that he would not be at the jobsite the next day, he gave Mr. Dahlen a list of jobs to be done. After he finished those jobs, he \u201ccould walk around the site, [to] make sure everyone\u2019s doing their job safely.\u201d[69] On other days when Mr. Chilton did not come to the jobsite, and when he had not left a list of jobs for Mr. Dahlen to do, Mr. Dahlen walked around to make sure everyone was working safely, and to administer first aid, if needed.[70]\n[50] Mr. Dahlen had control over the days that he worked on the townhouse project, particularly when he was participating in training for his anticipated longshoreman position. Mr. Dahlen merely notified Mr. Chilton and perhaps Jens Skov that he (Mr. Dahlen) would not be at the jobsite, whereupon, if needed (i.e., if Peter Skov\u2019s son, who was also a safety officer, was not available), Mr. Chilton arranged for a safety officer to be provided by Workforce.[71]\n[51] Jens Skov stated that, when Mr. Dahlen began to work at the jobsite, he worked full-time hours for a while, and then eventually he \u201cstarted scaling his hours back a bit,\u201d[72] to the point where he would sometimes be away \u201cfor days at a time.\u201d[73] Peter Skov said that Mr. Dahlen had considerable freedom on the jobsite, and that he could leave the site for job interviews.[74] Thus, it is my understanding that, at least to some extent, Mr. Dahlen was able to determine the days and hours that he worked on the jobsite.\n[52] As Mr. Dahlen had a pickup truck, which he drove to the jobsite, he was sometimes asked by Mr. Chilton or one of the subcontractors to pick up materials for them. Mr. Dahlen typically did so, without first contacting a representative of the Corporation to obtain permission to do so or to advise the Corporation that he was leaving the jobsite to pick up materials.[75]\n[53] When asked whether he understood that the five young men were each running a separate business as they worked for the Corporation, Peter Skov responded affirmatively, because they could come and go, and they did not work every single day. Some days they would be at the jobsite, other days they would not be there.[76]\n[54] During his direct examination, Mr. Dahlen stated that he was required to complete regular safety checklists provided to him by Mr. Chilton.[77] During his cross-examination, he stated that the safety checklists had been provided to him by UPA and that he was to fill them out and submit them to Mr. Chilton.[78]\n[55] It was during his cross-examination by Peter Skov that Mr. Dahlen recounted the experience of the tow truck driver who injured his forearm while reseating the beads on the tires. After Mr. Dahlen had recounted the experience, the following exchange occurred:\nQ. When an accident such like that happens[,] there\u2019s a WCB incident report?\nA. Yes, and I filled that out.\nQ. I never received one.\nA. Well, that would be from Dan [Chilton] and UPA because they were the ones that supplied me with those forms.\nQ. So you were working for UPA at that moment in time?\nA. At that moment in time, yes.[79]\n[56] The above exchange indicates that the incident-reporting documents used by Mr. Dahlen came from UPA, and not from the Corporation, that Mr. Dahlen reported the accident to UPA, but not to the Corporation, and that Mr. Dahlen considered himself, at least on that occasion, to be working for UPA.\n[57] Mr. Dahlen indicated that one of his responsibilities was to provide \u201can extra pair of hands when [he was] doing labour work\u2026.\u201d[80] During cross-examination, the following exchange took place:\nQ. You indicated that a lot of your job duties were to assist, for example, carpenters, finishing carpenters perhaps, plumbers, electricians, drywall individuals?\nA. Yes, I was directed by Dan [Chilton] to be helping those guys primarily and taking my first aid and my CSO duties secondary to that.[81]\nHence, it appears that Mr. Chilton directed Mr. Dahlen to subordinate his construction safety officer duties to the needs of the subtrades who were working on the jobsite.\n[58] When asked whether he had the status of a designated first-aid attendant when he worked at the jobsite, Mr. Dahlen responded:\nA. I was supposed to be a designated first aid and CSO [construction safety officer], but Dan [Chilton] had his own way of things, so he turned it around as me being primarily general labour and CSO\/first aid secondary to that.[82]\n[59] Mr. Dahlen stated that approximately 70 percent of his time at the jobsite was spent doing general labour and 30 percent was spent doing safety and first aid.[83]\n[60] As mentioned above, from time to time, while Mr. Dahlen worked at the jobsite, he was asked by Mr. Chilton, or perhaps by some of the subtrades, to drive his own pickup truck to Dunbar Lumber to pick up materials needed at the jobsite. This was done without the knowledge of the directors of the Corporation. Mr. Dahlen explained that he was trying to repay a favour extended to him by the Corporation. In other words, he said, the Corporation had done him a favour by providing him with work when he needed it, and he could return the favour by using his truck to pick up supplies from the lumberyard.[84] Mr. Dahlen explained that an employee of Dunbar Lumber had told him that it charged a flat rate of $100 for each delivery made to a jobsite. Therefore, each time that Mr. Dahlen used his truck to pick up supplies from the lumberyard, he was saving the Corporation $100,[85] although there was no evidence as to whether the delivery fees would have been charged to the Corporation or to UPA, and if the latter, whether they would have been charged back to the Corporation or would have been absorbed into the overall contract price.\n[61] During cross-examination, Mr. Dahlen explained the arrangement this way:\nQ. Now, you made a statement that you were the only one with a pickup truck?\nA. The only one with a pickup truck able at the time to go and pick up supplies. Obviously it\u2019s an understatement to assume that I was the only one on the site with a pickup truck. Right? Of course the carpenters and the plumbers and all of them, being tradesmen themselves, they would have a pickup, right? But Dan [Chilton] saw it easiest to send me to go and pick up the supplies, so then it doesn\u2019t interrupt their work throughout the day so the project is completed on time.\nQ. But this was directed by Dan?\nA. Yes, it was.[86]\nThe above comment is another example of the control exercised by UPA, and not the Corporation, over Mr. Dahlen.\n[62] Apparently Mr. Chilton gave Mr. Dahlen a set of keys to open and close the jobsite. If this was done, it was without the knowledge or consent of the Corporation, and, based on the nature and tone of Peter Skov\u2019s response during his cross-examination by Ms. Dahlen, without the approval or authorization of the Corporation.[87] Thus, to the extent that the Corporation may have delegated control over Mr. Dahlen to Mr. Chilton, such delegation was not open-ended or unrestricted. In other words, the impact of the control factor may be diminished.\n[63] As the above analysis has illustrated, the Corporation did not exercise control directly over Mr. Dahlen. Rather, it was Mr Chilton, UPA\u2019s site superintendent, who seemed to control Mr. Dahlen\u2019s activities. Given my understanding of the contractual relationship between the Corporation (i.e., the developer) and UPA (i.e., the general contractor),[88] and given that Jens Skov instructed Mr. Dahlen to report to Mr. Chilton,[89] I view this as a delegation of control, such that the control over Mr. Dahlen exercised by UPA\u2019s site superintendent, Mr. Chilton, also constituted control by the Corporation.[90]\n[64] While there was a limited delegation of control over Mr. Dahlen by the Corporation to Mr. Chilton, which points to employment, four other circumstances point the other direction. First, without conferring with the Corporation, Mr. Chilton changed the priority and focus of Mr. Dahlen\u2019s activities from being a construction safety officer, and, if time permitted, a \u201csecond set of hands,\u201d to being primarily a general labourer, and only secondarily a safety officer. Second, Mr. Dahlen had considerable freedom on the jobsite, such that he could determine the days and hours that he worked and he could leave the site for job interviews and longshoreman training. Third, the Corporation did not authorize Mr. Chilton to give jobsite keys to Mr. Dahlen. Fourth, given the potential vicarious liability of an employer that may arise if an employee has a motor vehicle accident while working, the use by Mr. Dahlen of his truck to pick up materials from the lumberyard did not come within any delegation of control by the Corporation to Mr. Chilton.[91] Thus, in my view, the control factor points in both directions.\n2. Ownership of Tools [65] When the townhouse project began, the Corporation rented a construction trailer and had it towed to the jobsite. Most of the space in the trailer was occupied by the foreman\u2019s\/site superintendent\u2019s office.[92] However, there was also a small first-aid station in the trailer.[93] According to Peter Skov, the only thing in the first-aid station was a first-aid kit. Mr. Dahlen stated that there was also a cot and an oxygen tank.[94] There was no evidence as to whether the Corporation owned the first-aid kit, cot and oxygen tank, or whether it rented them from a third party. Jens Skov stated that the Corporation provided the first-aid kit for the entire jobsite, and not specifically for Mr. Dahlen.[95]\n[66] The provision by the Corporation of a first-aid kit, a cot and an oxygen tank may be somewhat analogous to a hospital making an x-ray machine available to a radiologist. In some cases, a radiologist may be an employee of the hospital, but, in other cases, a radiologist may be an independent contractor working at the hospital. Thus, the provision by the Corporation of the first-aid kit, cot and oxygen tank are not necessarily indicative of an employment relationship.\n[67] UPA\u2019s site superintendent, Mr. Chilton, provided Mr. Dahlen with the clipboard and WCB forms that he used on a daily basis while monitoring workers on the jobsite and while patrolling the jobsite to ensure compliance with WCB rules and regulations. There was no evidence as to whether the clipboard belonged to Mr. Chilton personally or to UPA.\n[68] The tasks performed at the jobsite by Mr. Dahlen when he was not engaged in his safety-officer activities included sweeping and shoveling. The Corporation did not provide the brooms and shovels used by Mr. Dahlen. There was no specific evidence as to who provided the brooms and shovels, although there was a suggestion that it may have been UPA or one of the subcontractors.[96]\n[69] Mr. Dahlen owned the hard hat, safety vest and steel-toed boots that he wore while working at the jobsite. As mentioned elsewhere in these Reasons, Mr. Dahlen owned the pickup truck that he used from time to time to pick up materials from Dunbar Lumber. In my view, the truck was a significant asset, which tends to balance the scale.\n[70] This factor seems to be divided somewhat evenly between employment and independent contract.\n3. Hiring of Helpers [71] When Jens Skov was cross-examined by Ms. Dahlen, he stated that, as far as he knew, Mr. Dahlen had the ability to have somebody else work for him if he was not coming to work. However, Mr. Skov stated that he did not speak with Mr. Dahlen about subcontracting out to another contractor.[97]\n[72] Regardless of whether Mr. Dahlen had, or did not have, authority to hire a replacement worker, Mr. Dahlen did not attempt to do so. Rather, on those occasions when he did not go to the jobsite, particularly when he was participating in training for his longshoreman position, and when another CSO, such as Peter Skov\u2019s son, was not working at the jobsite,[98] Mr. Dahlen notified Mr. Chilton, and Mr. Chilton then hired a replacement CSO from Workforce. Not only does this indicate that it was relatively straightforward for Mr. Dahlen to have Mr. Chilton arrange for a replacement CSO, but it also shows that the position of CSO could readily be filled by someone who was not an employee of UPA or of the Corporation.\n[73] I do not view this factor as clearly pointing in either direction.\n4. Risk of Loss [74] For income tax purposes, Mr. Dahlen did not claim any expenses as deductions against the compensation that he was paid by the Corporation.\n[75] As noted above, Mr. Dahlen sometimes used his truck to pick up materials from Dunbar Lumber. By reason of this unique arrangement, which Mr. Dahlen undertook of his own volition (although he may have been persuaded by Mr. Chilton, who represented UPA, and not the Corporation), there would have been some modest expenses incurred by Mr. Dahlen (for instance, for gasoline), together with additional wear and tear on his truck. There was also the risk of getting in an accident while driving to or from the lumberyard or having his truck damaged as materials were loaded into it or unloaded from it.\n[76] When a worker provides his own vehicle for his work, it has been recognized that there is a risk of loss:\nThe contract also carried with it the risk for [the appellant] of significant loss. Traffic fines, damage to his vehicle and the potential for liability to others for damage caused in the course of the work were all potential sources of loss. Some of these risks were significant, and some he could insure against. Indeed, he was required to insure against liability to third parties. But the potential for unforeseen losses is always a hazard in those cases where the worker provides the vehicle at his own expense.[99]\n[77] While there was not a substantial risk of loss, this factor is suggestive of an independent contract, rather than employment.\n5. Responsibility for Investment and Management [78] There was no evidence that related specifically to this particular factor. However, Mr. Dahlen had invested in the truck that he drove to the jobsite and sometimes used to pick up materials. In City Water, the Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged that providing a vehicle is a major investment, which may favor a finding that a worker is an independent contractor.[100]\n[79] This factor is indicative of an independent contract.\n6. Opportunity for Profit [80] Jens Skov stated that Mr. Dahlen was at liberty to set his own hours each work day. In response to a question asked during cross-examination as to whether Mr. Dahlen could have come to the jobsite at 3:00 p.m., Jens stated that Mr. Dahlen could have done so if he had wanted to get paid for only two hours of work that day. In other words, if Mr. Dahlen arrived at the jobsite later in the day, he would simply be paid for less work.[101]\n[81] It might be argued that, as Mr. Dahlen was at liberty to set his own hours each work day, he could have earned more, and he could have made a profit, by working longer hours. However, this argument is not supported by the jurisprudence. Rather, the case law supports the proposition that generally \u201ca worker who is paid by the hour does not have a chance of profit simply by having the ability to earn more by working more.\u201d[102]\n[82] This factor points toward Mr. Dahlen having had the status of an employee, rather than an independent contractor.\n7. Weighing and Balancing [83] This is a situation where the analysis of the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors does not provide a clear result. In some situations, this could suggest that perhaps greater emphasis should be placed on the intention of the parties, as was done in City Water.[103] However, in these Appeals, the parties do not acknowledge that they shared a common intention.\n[84] For the purposes of weighing and balancing the above factors, this situation is a close call.[104] While, overall, many of the factors point in both directions, or in neither direction, and some factors balance out other factors, I think that Mr. Dahlen\u2019s freedom to set his own days and hours of work and to be absent from the jobsite, in his quest for other work,[105] and his having taken it upon himself to use his truck to pick up and deliver materials, without telling the Corporation,[106] tip the scale in favor of an independent-contractor relationship, rather than an employment relationship.\n[85] The close-call nature of this situation may also suggest that the relationship between Mr. Dahlen and the Corporation was somewhere on the continuum between an employment relationship and an independent-contractor relationship, which I will now consider.\nG. Continuum between Employment and Independent Contract\n[86] In recent years, several courts have noted that there is not a stark dichotomy between an employment contract (traditionally called a contract of service) and an independent contract (traditionally called a contract for services). Rather, there is a continuum between the two, with the employer-employee relationship at one end, the independent-contractor relationship at the other end, and a hybrid, intermediate or dependent-contractor relationship \u201csomewhere in the middle.\u201d[107] Many of those cases dealt with the question of whether a hirer was required to give reasonable notice to a worker before terminating the contract between them. This concept was described in Marbry Distributors in these terms:\nAll relationships in the workplace setting can perhaps be thought of as existing on a continuum. At one end of the continuum lies the employer\/employee relationship where reasonable notice is required to terminate. At the other extremity are independent contracting or strict agency relationships where notice is not required. The difficulty obviously lies in determining where upon that continuum one is located. Does the relationship bear more resemblance to the employer\/employee or the independent contractor status?[108]\n[87] From an employment-law perspective, the status of a dependent contractor has been described as follows:\nAs a general proposition, a person on an employer\u2019s payroll and for whom the employer makes conventional statutory deductions from his pay will be considered to be an employee\u2026. An independent contractor\u2026 is not an employee. Between those two states lies a construct of the common law: the dependent contractor. The dependent contractor is not on payroll, but in most other ways operates and is treated as an employee.[109]\n[88] Although a dependent contractor generally operates and is treated as an employee, the jurisprudence has recognized that a hybrid, intermediate or dependent-contractor relationship is akin to, but not the same as, an employer-employee relationship.[110]\n[89] The common law\u2019s evolutionary process, leading to a recognition of relationships that are neither employer-employee relationships nor independent-contractor relationships, has been described as follows:\nThe jurisprudence of employment law has, in relatively recent times, evolved to recognize the realities of the modern workplace and the fact that the relationship between workers and those to whom they provide their services are not simply binary\u2014either employee-employer or independent contractor. In a number of decisions, the courts have come to acknowledge that there are a variety of different arrangements that the parties may have. The approach to be taken is to examine the situation from a functional perspective.\nThe result has been the recognition of relationships that fall within an area between the two traditional models. Dealing with a similar issue in Kahn v. All-Can Express Ltd., 2014 BCSC 1429, I made the following comments, which I feel are pertinent to the matter at hand:\n\u2026 Based upon a number of authorities to which I have been referred, I am satisfied that the common law with respect to this issue has evolved into a more nuanced state, one that reflects the reality of an economy where many workers perform services for others in arrangements that are specifically structured such that they are neither employer-employee relationships nor are they properly characterizable as independent contractor relationships.\n\u2026 In effect, the courts have recognized that these sorts of relationships, depending upon their particular features, can fall at different points along a continuum, ranging from pure employer-employee situations to classic independent contractor arrangements\u2026.[111]\n[90] The Ontario Court of Appeal has provided guidance as to the manner in which the existence of a dependent-contractor relationship is to be determined, as well as some of the policy reasons for, and the consequences of, that determination, as follows:\n[30] I conclude that an intermediate category exists, which consists, at least, of those non-employment work relationships that exhibit a certain minimum economic dependency, which may be demonstrated by complete or near-complete exclusivity. Workers in this category are known as \u201cdependent contractors\u201d and they are owed reasonable notice upon termination\u2026.\n[32] Having concluded that there is an intermediate category between independent contractor and employee, namely \u201cdependent contractor\u201d, I also conclude that the legal principles applicable to distinguishing between employee[s] and independent contractors apply equally to the distinction between employees and dependent contractors. In this way, the dependent contractor category arises as a \u201ccarve-out\u201d from the non-employment category and does not affect the range of the employment category....\n[34] In this way, the proper initial step is to determine whether a worker is a contractor or an employee, for which the Sagaz\/Belton analysis, described in the next section, controls. Under that analysis, the exclusivity of the worker is listed as a factor weighing in favour of the employee category (Belton\u2019s first principle). The next step, required only if the first step results in a contractor conclusion, determines whether the contractor is independent or dependent, for which a worker\u2019s exclusivity is determinative, as it demonstrates economic dependence. Therefore, exclusivity might be a \u201challmark\u201d of the dependent contractor category vis-\u00e0-vis the broader category of contractors. However, it continues also as a factor in determining whether the worker is not a contractor at all, but rather an employee, in the first-step analysis.\n[35] This process of analysis serves the policy purposes that underlie the jurisprudence. In summarizing the caselaw, Geoffrey England, Roderick Wood & Innis Christie, Employment Law in Canada, 4th ed. (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis Canada) vol. 1, at s. 2.33, describes [sic] the frequently stated policy reasons for recognizing an intermediate category:\nThese decisions have frequently acknowledged the policy justification for using the \u201cintermediate\u201d status doctrine in order to extend the safeguards of the employment contract to self-employed workers who are subject to relatively high levels of subordination and\/or economic dependency, but who, technically, do not qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d strict sensu.\n[36] Given this concern to safeguard workers who are formally \u201ccontractors\u201d but who are in a position of economic vulnerability, it only makes sense to carve the dependent contractor category out of the broader existing contractor category and leave the range of the employee category intact. Therefore the appropriate analysis for distinguishing employees from \u201ccontractors\u201d generally is the existing analysis for distinguishing employees from independent contractors.[112]\n[91] Hence, the concept of a dependent contract or an intermediate relationship does not diminish the space occupied by employment. Rather, it simply recognizes that between the employment space and the independent-contract space there is an intermediate space that is neither employment nor independent contract, although it has some similarities to both of them.\n[92] Given the judicial recognition of an intermediate or hybrid category of worker, sometimes called a dependent contractor, \u201cthe test today for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor is more nuanced than in the past.\u201d[113]\n[93] As indicated in McKee,[114] an analysis based on the Wiebe Door\/Sagaz\/Belton factors is typically used to distinguish between an employee and a dependent contractor, similar to the approach taken to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor. Based on the analysis undertaken above,[115] I conclude that, if Mr. Dahlen was not an independent contractor, he was in a hybrid, intermediate or dependent-contractor relationship with the Corporation.\nH. Requirement of Employment\n[94] Subsection 5(1) of the EIA makes it clear that, apart from service in the Canadian Forces or a police force, the term insurable employment requires that there be employment in one of four specified categories.[116] Similarly, the definition of the term pensionable employment in subsections 2(1) and 6(1) of the CPP (when read together) makes it clear that pensionable employment requires that there be employment.\n[95] While a hirer-worker relationship in the intermediate category may, in some respects, be akin to employment, as noted above, the cases have indicated that such an intermediate relationship is not actually employment.[117]\n[96] In Marbry, Chief Justice McEachern, in dissent, made the following statement, albeit in a slightly different context:\nWith respect to the analysis undertaken in so many similar cases regarding near-employment relationships, I only wish to say that except in the game of horseshoes, \u201cnear\u201d is not usually enough for the establishment of legal relations. Just because a commercial relationship is close to an employment relationship does not permit judges to imply a term into an agreement which the parties themselves chose not to agree upon.[118]\nI am of the view that a similar principle applies here. In other words, the proximity or nearness of a contractor relationship to an employment relationship does not permit a judge to categorize the relationship as employment for the purposes of the EIA and the CPP. The EIA and the CPP impose significant obligations on hirers and workers (to pay premiums and contributions) and on the federal government (to pay benefits and pensions). Those obligations should be imposed only where there is clearly (and not nearly) an employment relationship. In my view, an intermediate, hybrid or dependent-contractor relationship does not qualify as either insurable employment or pensionable employment.\nI. Summary and Resolution\n[97] For the reasons set out above, I have concluded that, for the purposes of the CPP and the EIA, Mr. Dahlen was not an employee of the Corporation.\nV. CONCLUSION [98] The Appeals are allowed, and the Decision is set aside.\n[99] As neither the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Canada Pension Plan nor the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Employment Insurance Act provide for costs, I am not making any ruling in respect of the costs of these Appeals.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 4th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDon R.

ISSUE [1] The issue in this Appeal is whether Adelina (Adele) Simonetta is entitled to the new housing rebate (the \u201cRebate\u201d), pursuant to subsection 254(2) of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cETA\u201d), in respect of her purchase of a house (the \u201cHouse\u201d) and lot (the \u201cLot\u201d) located on Edgevalley Drive, Toronto, Ontario (together, the \u201cProperty\u201d). Ms. Simonetta asserts that she qualifies for the Rebate. The Crown takes the position that Ms. Simonetta failed to satisfy paragraph 254(2)(d) and subsection 262(1) of the ETA. More specifically, the Crown submits that Ms. Simonetta did not pay any harmonized sales tax (\u201cHST\u201d) in respect of the supply of the Property, and that the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder (Form GST 190)[1] (the \u201cApplication\u201d) sent by Ms. Simonetta to the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) did not show the name, business number and contact information of, and was not signed by, the builder of the House. Those are the only two reasons asserted by the Crown in denying Ms. Simonetta\u2019s claim for the Rebate.\n[2] Notably, the Crown did not advance any arguments to suggest that:\na)The sale to Ms. Simonetta of the Property was not a taxable supply. In other words, the Crown did not submit that the sale was an exempt supply (see paragraph 254(2)(a) of the ETA).\nb)The Property had been occupied by someone else before Ms. Simonetta purchased it (see paragraph 254(2)(f) of the ETA).\nc)The first individual to occupy the Property was not Ms. Simonetta or one of her relations or family members (see paragraph 254(2)(g) of the ETA).\nII. FACTS [3] Biagio Simonetta is married to Ms. Simonetta. He is a certified professional accountant and the chief financial officer of the A.R.G. Group of Companies, which is a real estate firm, and which develops, constructs and sells industrial units and residential properties.\n[4] Mr. Simonetta stated that he found a reference to the Property online and became interested in viewing the Property, with the thought of possibly purchasing the Property. Paul Simonetta, who is the son of Biagio and Adelina Simonetta and who is a real estate agent, assisted his parents in researching the Property and preparing the Agreement of Purchase and Sale (the \u201cAPS\u201d).[2]\n[5] As the Simonettas researched the Property, they learned that:\na) Two individuals (the \u201cVendors\u201d)[3] had purchased a two-storey, four\u2011bedroom house (the \u201cOriginal Dwelling\u201d), which was located on the Lot, on May 19, 2010 (with a closing date of September 1, 2010), at a price of $1,155,000.[4]\nb) On February 13, 2013, the Vendors obtained, from the City of Toronto (Etobicoke York District), what appears to be a demolition and construction permit in respect of the Lot.[5]\nc) After obtaining the above permit, the Vendors arranged for the Original Dwelling to be demolished and for the House to be constructed on the Lot.\nd) On May 29, 2015, the Vendors entered into a listing agreement (having an expiry date of September 30, 2015) with Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. (\u201cRoyal LePage\u201d) in respect of the Property. The corresponding MLS listing document gave the approximate age of the House as \u201cNew\u201d and described the House as \u201cCustom New Build,\u201d with a list price of $3,600,0000 for the Property.[6]\ne) On June 27, 2015, the Vendors entered into another listing agreement (having an expiry date of December 30, 2015) with Royal LePage in respect of the Property. The corresponding MLS listing document gave the approximate age of the House as \u201cNew,\u201d described the House as \u201cCustom New Build,\u201d and showed a list price of $3,500,000 for the Property.[7]\nf) On February 18, 2016, the Vendors entered into a listing agreement (having an expiry date of July 2, 2016) with Forest Hill Real Estate Inc. (\u201cForest Hill\u201d) in respect of the Property. The corresponding MLS listing document gave the approximate age of the House as \u201cNew,\u201d described the House as \u201cNewly Built Custom Home,\u201d and showed a list price of $3,395,000 for the Property.[8]\ng) On May 13, 2016, the Vendors entered into another listing agreement (having an expiry date of August 13, 2016) with Forest Hill in respect of the Property. The corresponding MLS listing document gave the approximate age of the House as \u201cNew,\u201d described it as \u201cNewly Built Custom Home,\u201d and showed a list price of $3,295,000 for the Property.[9]\nh) On August 31, 2016, the Vendors entered into a listing agreement (having an expiry date of October 31, 2016) with Sam McDadi Real Estate Inc. in respect of the Property. The corresponding MLS listing document gave the approximate age of the House as \u201cNew,\u201d but did not describe it as \u201cNew Build\u201d or \u201cNewly Built Custom Home,\u201d as had been done before in the previous listing documents. The list price of the Property was shown as $3,249,000.[10] This was the listing document that caught Mr. Simonetta\u2019s attention.\n[6] Notwithstanding that the Crown, in its pleadings, had not challenged the position taken by Ms. Simonetta that, when she purchased the Property, it was new and had not been previously occupied, on the first day of the hearing, a considerable amount of time was taken up addressing those particular questions, as summarized in the ensuing paragraphs.\n[7] Mr. Simonetta viewed three virtual tours of the Property. The first virtual tour, which he described as Link 1, had a digital document number of 356202. The second virtual tour, which he described as Link 2, had a digital document number of 6930238. The third virtual tour, which he described as Link 3, had a digital document identifier of DQBEKA. The following observations may be made about the three virtual tours of the Property:\na) In the first and third virtual tours, the House was staged, i.e., it had furniture, artwork and floor coverings much as one would expect to see in a show home. However, the furniture, artwork and floor coverings were different in the two virtual tours. In other words, it was obvious that after the first virtual tour had been photographed or filmed, the furniture, artwork and floor coverings were removed, and sometime later, prior to photographing or filming the third virtual tour, different furniture, artwork and floor coverings were placed in the House.\nb) In the second virtual tour, there was no furniture, artwork or floor coverings in the House. Rather, the House was bare.\nc) There were no window coverings in any of the three virtual tours.\n[8] Prior to Ms. Simonetta making an offer to purchase the Property, she and Mr. Simonetta (together, the \u201cSimonettas\u201d) toured the Property themselves. Describing what he observed as he toured the Property, Mr. Simonetta testified that:\na) Some of the packing plastic was still on the surface of the gas range in the kitchen.\nb) The racks in the oven were still in cardboard packaging.\nc) The shelves in the refrigerator were all taped together and lying in a stack on the bottom of the refrigerator.\nd) The refrigerator still had Styrofoam packaging inside it and the drawers were taped shut.\ne) The operator manuals for the washer and dryer were still inside the appliances.\nf) The shipping bolts in the washing machine (to keep the tub secure) had not been removed.\ng) The vent opening of the dryer had not been connected to the exterior vent.\nh) The wine refrigerator was still wrapped.\ni) There were no window coverings.\nj) There were no rods, shelves or drawers in any of the closets.\nk) The marble tile walls in the showers were still covered with marble dust, which appeared to have been caused by the tiles being cut before they were installed.\n[9] Ms. Simonetta confirmed most of the above observations made by her husband. Describing her perceptions during the tour, she also stated that:\na)Upon entering the House, it smelled like a new house.\nb)There was still sawdust in the kitchen cupboards.\nc)When she turned on the exhaust fan over the gas range, sawdust spilled out of the vent.\nd)Factory oils were still on the inside walls of the oven and on the griddle.\ne)The stove, range and griddle had not been cured.\nf)It appeared that the House had not been previously occupied.\n[10] Mr. Simonetta, who (by reason of his career) has knowledge concerning new home construction and occupancy permits, produced a copy of a document entitled \u201cToronto Building\u2019s TelePermit System Automated Inspection Status Report,\u201d showing that the building permit for the House had been closed on November 15, 2016, with an indication that work was complete.[11] The document showed that the occupancy status had been determined as \u201cPassed\u201d on November 15, 2016. Mr. Simonetta explained that, when he first viewed the Property, it was clear that there were a number of construction deficiencies that required resolution. During the ensuing period between mid-September and mid-November of 2016, various workers worked on the Property to resolve the deficiencies and to make the House suitable for occupancy. Mr. Simonetta also stated that it is his experience that an occupancy permit is issued only once by the City of Toronto and that it is issued after an inspector has determined that a new house is suitable for occupancy.\n[11] On September 9, 2016, Ms. Simonetta signed the APS. The opening portion of the APS stated that the price of the Property was $3,158,000.\n[12] Before Ms. Simonetta signed the APS, Mr. Simonetta made a point of ensuring that paragraph 7 thereof was completed so as to read as follows:\nHST: If the sale of the Property (Real Property as described above) is subject to Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), then such tax shall be included in the Purchase Price. If the sale of the Property is not subject to HST, Seller agrees to certify on or before closing that the sale of the Property is not subject to HST. Any HST on chattels, if applicable, is not included in the Purchase Price.[12] [Italics added.]\n[13] As the closing of the sale and purchase transaction approached, it became apparent that the Vendors and Ms. Simonetta took different positions concerning the exigibility of HST in respect of the supply of the Property. This difference was apparent in some of the correspondence exchanged by the solicitors for the respective parties. On November 16, 2016 (which was the originally scheduled closing date), Cindy M. Aulicino of Rigobon Carli (the solicitors for Ms. Simonetta) wrote to a letter to the solicitor for the Vendors. Paragraph 5 of that letter read as follows:\nThe home is new construction and accordingly subject to HST. As the Agreement of Purchase and Sale indicated that HST was included in the purchase price, we require amended statement of adjustments to reflect the purchase price net of the HST for purposes of the transfer in order to calculate the Land Transfer Tax exigible thereon. We require amended Vendors\u2019 documents as the document provided to us is incorrect as the Vendors are claiming that HST is not exigible as it is a used residential property, which is false. We have reviewed all prior listings for the property and pictures from the listings either show the home as empty of all furniture or staged. The home was staged two (2) separate times, with different furniture and accessories. Did your clients move in and out three (3) times during the year and did they buy furniture two (2) separate times to furnish the home? If your clients have lived in the home, as they claim, then we require the same evidence that Canada Revenue Agency would require that indicates that this is a used residential home, including copies of their driver\u2019s licence and health cards showing the address of the home thereon and copies of all utility bills for the property, including cable\/internet, that shows utilities have been consumed consistent with a family occupying and using the home.[13]\n[14] Rather than providing Ms. Aulicino with the requested documentation (such as copies of utility bills, driver\u2019s licences and health cards), on November 17, 2016, the Vendors\u2019 solicitor wrote, rather cryptically, to Walter J. Rigobon (also of Rigobon Carli), as follows:\nMy client\u2019s [sic] advise that they have owned the property for 5 years, that the home after construction was occupied as their residence. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale my clients have certified the sale of the property is not subject to HST. The issue of whether the HST is payable is a matter for CRA to determine. My clients have satisfied the HST provisions of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.[14]\n[15] The Simonettas recognized that the letter from the Vendors\u2019 solicitor contained two misrepresentations. First, the Simonettas were well aware that the House had not been occupied as a residence by anyone, let alone the Vendors. Second, the Simonettas were aware that the Vendors had not provided them with any certification that the sale of the Property was not subject to HST.[15]\n[16] After receiving the above-mentioned letter of November 17, 2016, Ms. Aulicino replied to the Vendors\u2019 solicitor. Her letter, also dated November 17, 2016, contained the following statement concerning the HST issue:\nWe do not agree with your position; however, our client has instructed us to close and reserves her rights accordingly.[16]\n[17] Due to a delay encountered in discharging one or more mortgages from the title to the Property, the transaction closed a couple of days later than originally scheduled. After the Simonettas moved into the House, their understanding that no one had previously occupied the House was confirmed. For instance, Ms. Simonetta explained that, after they took possession of the Property, in order to make the House habitable and the appliances functional, she needed to:\na) clean a lot of sawdust out of the kitchen cupboards;\nb) with the help of Mr. Simonetta, wash marble dust off the shower walls and bathroom walls;\nc) cure the gas oven and range;\nd) wash and cure the griddle;\ne) wash the oven walls to remove the factory oils;\nf) unwrap and install the trays and shelves (presumably, she meant racks) for the oven;\ng) clean sawdust from the exhaust fan over the gas range;\nh) unpack and install the shelves and drawers in the refrigerator;\ni) remove the operator manuals from the dishwasher, washing machine and clothes dryer; and\nj) remove the shipping bolts from the back of the washing machine.[17]\nAs well, the Simonettas spent approximately $20,000 to purchase and instal closet organizers.[18] In addition, they hired a handyman to install tubing to connect the exhaust at the back of the clothes dryer to the exterior vent outlet.[19]\n[18] In reviewing the warranty documentation and the packing slips for some of the appliances,[20] Mr. Simonetta observed that some of the appliances had been delivered to the House in November 2014 (i.e., approximately two years before the Simonettas moved into the House).[21] As noted above, it was clear to the Simonettas that those appliances had not been used in the two-year interval between 2014 and 2016.\n[19] After taking ownership and possession of the Property, and having confirmed what they already knew, i.e., that the House had not been previously occupied, the Simonettas instructed Mr. Rigobon to send a letter to the Vendors\u2019 solicitor, advising that Ms. Simonetta intended to apply for the Rebate, in the amount of $24,000. Accordingly, on December 15, 2016, Mr. Rigobon sent a letter to Mr. Davidson. The opening paragraph of the letter began as follows:\nFurther to our letter to you of November 16, 2016 and your response contained in paragraph 5 of your letter of November 17, 2016[,] our client has conducted further review and investigation in this matter. It would appear clear that your client never occupied the property and the property constitutes a new home construction for the purposes of the appropriate tax legislation. Accordingly, kindly advise your client that our client will be making the appropriate application for H.S.T. reimbursement in the amount of Twenty-Four Thousand Dollars ($24,000.00) for the rebate provided for new homes.[22]\nRecognizing that an application by Ms. Simonetta to the CRA for the Rebate might trigger an audit of the Vendors, Mr. Rigobon went on to advise the Vendors\u2019 solicitor that Ms. Simonetta would not apply for the Rebate if the Vendors were to pay $24,000 to her.[23]\n[20] The same day, the solicitor for the Vendors replied to Mr. Rigobon, with the following curt response:\nMy clients advise that the sale of their home is not subject to HST.[24]\n[21] In December 2016, Mr. Simonetta completed, and Ms. Simonetta signed, the rebate application form entitled \u201cGST\/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder\u201d (Form GST190) (defined above as the \u201cApplication\u201d), to which was attached a copy of a document entitled \u201cGST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule\u201d (Form RC7190-ON) and a copy of the Statement of Adjustments for the sale and purchase transaction in respect of the Property.[25] Given the uncooperative and dismissive nature of the letters from the Vendors\u2019 solicitor, as referenced above, Mr. Simonetta was certain that he would not be able to obtain the builder information necessary to complete section D of the Application.[26] Therefore, he left that section blank. While he knew, and could have inserted the names of the Vendors, his failure to do so was not critical, as the names of the Vendors were shown at the top of the Statement of Adjustments that was attached to the Application. The failure to provide the other builder information is an issue that I will discuss below.\n[22] Regrettably, on account of the pandemic and the associated Court closure for much of that time, the continuation of the hearing of this Appeal was delayed until November 29, 2021. When the hearing reconvened, counsel for the Crown called Mr. B, one of the Vendors, as a witness. He appeared by video connection. To my surprise, and possibly to the surprise of the Simonettas, Mr. B readily acknowledged that at no time did he or any member of his family occupy the Property as a residence. He also stated that he had owned the Property for more than five years before its sale to Ms. Simonetta. These two statements by Mr. B were completely contrary to statements made by the Vendors\u2019 solicitor in his letter of November 17, 2016.\n[23] When Mr. B was asked why the solicitor representing him and the other Vendor had made incorrect statements in his letter, all that Mr. B said was that he was not sure why the solicitor\u2019s letter was written that way, that he didn\u2019t have an answer for that question, and that he couldn\u2019t tell the Court what the solicitor was thinking when he wrote the letter. To my mind, that is an unsatisfactory response. Either the solicitor wrote the letter based on instructions given to him by his clients, or he fabricated the letter without discussing it with his clients. Mr. B did not address or discuss either of those possibilities. Given the ethical duties of lawyers to their clients and to third parties who are interacting with their clients, it seems unlikely that the solicitor fabricated the letter without any input from the Vendors. In my mind, this raises significant questions concerning the credibility and reliability of Mr. B\u2019s testimony, about which I will have more to say later.\n[24] During his examination-in-chief, Mr. B provided a woeful summary of unfortunate events that transpired during the approval and construction phases in respect of the House. Some of the notable aspects of that unfortunate series of events are the following:\na) The new House that the Vendors proposed to have built was substantially larger than the Original Dwelling, which they had demolished. This caused an uproar and considerable opposition from the neighbours, which required several meetings with local government officials and ultimately a revision of the proposed plans and a reduction in the size of the House.\nb) Shortly after the basement had been excavated, the historic flood of 2013 occurred, which filled the excavation pit and destabilized the bank.\nc) Due to the bank destabilization, the foundation of their neighbour\u2019s home cracked, as a result of which the Vendors were required to reinforce that foundation with steel beams, at a major cost to the Vendors.\nd) The neighbour with the cracked foundation commenced a lawsuit against the Vendors, relating to an insurance claim in respect of her house.\ne) In the same year or the following year, an ice storm hit Toronto.\nf) One of the neighbours continually harassed the workers on the job site, to the point that Mr. B had to call the police and hire a private security company.\ng) The purchase of the Property and the construction of the House were heavily financed. Ultimately, the debt became unmanageable and the position of the Vendors became untenable. Due to the financial difficulties, the approval and construction delays, and the added costs, the House became unaffordable and problematic.[27]\n[25] As a result of the forgoing events, as well as the general animosity of the neighbours, the Vendors decided sometime in the latter part of 2014 not to move into the House when it was ultimately completed. However, based on advice that they received from a friend and business associate (the \u201cAssociate\u201d), who was the source of most of their financing, they decided that the preferred course of action was to carry on with the construction of the House, to its completion, and then to sell the House, hopefully for enough money to enable them to pay off all of their debts and to realize a profit, as well.\n[26] Construction of the House was substantially completed in 2014. During the winter of 2014-2015, the Vendors met with a real estate agent, to discuss the sale of the Property. \u201cTo get a spring market,\u201d they waited until May 2015 to list the Property for sale.[28] Ultimately, over a period of 15 months, the Vendors entered into five successive listing agreements, before Ms. Simonetta came across the Property and ultimately purchased it.\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Credibility and Reliability of Mr. B\u2019s Evidence\n[27] In paragraph 5 on page 2 of Ms. Aulicino\u2019s letter of November 16, 2016 to the Vendors\u2019 solicitor, she outlined her concern that the House was newly constructed and that its sale was subject to HST. She supported her concern by referring to the MLS listing documents discussed above and the pictures from the virtual tours showing the House as staged, then empty, then staged again with different furniture and accessories. She provided the Vendors\u2019 solicitor with an opportunity for his clients to alleviate that concern by providing documentary evidence (such as driver\u2019s licences, health cards and utility bills) to show that the Vendors actually had been occupying and using the House.[29] Rather than providing the requested documentation, or explaining why it would not be provided, and rather than acknowledging or addressing Ms. Aulicino\u2019s observations about the listing documents and the pictures from the virtual tours, the Vendors\u2019 solicitor, in his letter of November 17, 2016, simply said that his clients advised that they had owned the Property for five years and that the House, after construction, was occupied as their residence.[30] I consider that to be an insufficient and obfuscatory response to the concerns raised by Ms. Aulicino on behalf of Ms. Simonetta.\n[28] Unless the Vendors\u2019 solicitor decided to fabricate the details set out in his letter of November 17, 2016, which is unlikely, the Vendors, through their solicitor, made representations that they had owned the Property for five years, that they had occupied it as their residence, and that they had certified the sale of the Property as not being subject to HST, when, in fact, the Vendors had then owned the Property for slightly more than six years, they had never occupied the Property as their residence, and they had not certified that the sale of the Property was not subject to HST. Given those misrepresentations, I have doubts in my mind as to the extent to which I may rely on the evidence given by Mr. B.\n[29] In Ms. Aulicino\u2019s letter of November 16, 2016, she also raised a concern about construction liens, as follows:\nAs the home is new construction, we require either (i) a statutory declaration from the Vendors that all trades, suppliers, contractors, materials, etc. have been paid and that there has not been any work to the property in the past 45 days that if unpaid could form a lien on the property under the Construction Lien Act, (Ontario) or, (ii) a holdback equivalent to 10% of the construction contract to be held by your firm in trust until 45 days has [sic] elapsed from the closing date and evidence that no liens have been registered on title to the property. Your letter of even date advises that there has been no work to the property for over a year, however, our client advises that the Vendors have retained contractors to make repairs to the home as there were some deficiencies. Please provide us with evidence that these contractors have been paid.[31]\nThe above-referenced \u201cletter of even date\u201d was not put into evidence.\n[30] During his testimony, Mr. Simonetta stated that, when he first viewed the Property, he noticed deficiencies that he brought to the attention of the Vendors, and that they arranged to have various tradesmen attend at the Property to remedy the deficiencies. Mr. Simonetta also testified that the City of Toronto building inspectors who had viewed the Property had registered various deficiencies on the title to the Property. Shortly before the closing of the sale and purchase transaction, the deficiencies were completed and an occupancy permit was provided by the City. I accept that work was being done on the Property between September 2016 and November 2016 inclusive. Therefore, I consider the statement given by the Vendors, through their solicitor, to the effect that there had been no work done on the Property for over a year, to be incorrect. This casts doubt on the reliability of the other statements made by the Vendors through their solicitor.\n[31] I also have concerns about Mr. B\u2019s memory of relevant events. For instance, during his examination-in-chief, Mr. B stated that the Vendors had listed the Property three times,[32] whereas it appears that the Property to was actually listed five times.[33] At another point in his examination-in-chief, he stated that the ice storm occurred a year after the flood, but only a few minutes later, he stated that the ice storm occurred in the same year as the flood. Mr. B also stated that he did not remember whether he reported the sale of the Property on his 2016 income tax return. As well, he could not remember the rate of interest he was paying to the Bank of Montreal (the \u201cBank\u201d) in respect of the mortgage loan that he and the other Vendor had obtained to enable them to purchase the Property, although he thought that the rate was likely in the range of 2% to 3% per year.\n[32] Further examples suggesting that Mr. B\u2019s recollection of the relevant events and circumstances may have been deficient are the following:\na)Mr. B testified that the ceiling in the basement of the House was over 15 feet high.[34] However, the third and fourth MLS listings stated that the lower level (presumably the basement) had ten-foot ceilings.[35]\nb) Mr. B testified that, by the time the construction of the House was concluded, there were four mortgages registered against the title to the Property.[36] However, it is my understanding that there were actually five mortgages registered against the title to the Property.[37]\n[33] During his testimony, Mr. B produced an incomplete copy of a Forbearance Agreement, dated September 16, 2015, among the Bank, himself and the other Vendor. He acknowledged to the Court that he had removed a number of provisions from that agreement, which he preferred to keep confidential, as they related to other litigation between the Bank and himself. This deletion of some of the Forbearance Agreement was acknowledged by him only when he was questioned about what appeared to be missing provisions. At that point, Mr. B readily offered to provide the full document, saying that he had the fully intact document. When he subsequently produced what was supposedly the complete copy of the Forbearance Agreement, there were several differences between the version that was originally produced and the version that was subsequently produced. In addition, neither version had been executed by the Bank. The Forbearance Agreement also refers to completed but unsworn [sic] statutory declarations that were attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d and a consent to judgment that was attached as Schedule \u201cB\u201d. Neither of those schedules was attached to either copy of the Forbearance Agreement that was put before the Court. Consequently, I was left wondering whether there was something that Mr. B preferred that I not see.\n[34] At a case management conference on October 31, 2022, I expressed my concerns about the copies of the Forbearance Agreement that had been produced to me. Counsel for the Crown subsequently provided to me copies of two counterparts of an agreement entitled \u201cFurther Amended and Extended Forbearance Agreement\u201d, which were dated October 15, 2018 (i.e., more than three years after the date of the Forbearance Agreement that was originally provided by Mr. B to the Court.) The counterparts of the Further Amended and Extended Forbearance Agreement contained executed copies of the statutory declarations referred to above and a consent to judgment (also referred to above) signed by the then solicitor for the Vendors.[38]\n[35] Mr. B stated that he did not seek qualified tax advice concerning whether the sale of the Property was a taxable supply or an exempt supply. Rather, he discussed the matter with his real estate agent, who advised that, because Mr. B was \u201cnot a builder and it was [his] home, it is not [his] business, the sale is not subject to HST.\u201d[39]\nB. CRA\u2019s Assumptions [36] Paragraph 7 of the Crown\u2019s Reply lists the following assumptions of fact made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) in assessing Ms. Simonetta to deny the Rebate for which she had applied:\na) on September 9, 2016, the Appellant [i.e., Ms. Simonetta] signed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with the Sellers [i.e., the Vendors] to acquire the Property;\nb) the purchase price of the Property was $3,158,000;\nc) the purchase price of the Property did not include GST or HST; and\nd) the Appellant did not pay any amount representing tax under the [Excise Tax] Act on the purchase of the Property.\n[37] Notably, the Minister did not assume any of the following as facts:\na)The Vendors did not, at a time when they had an interest in the Lot, carry on, or engage another person to carry on for them, the construction of the House.\nb)The Vendors constructed, or engaged another person to construct, the House otherwise than in the course of a business or an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.\nc)The Vendors occupied the Property as a place of residence or lodging.\nd)Neither Vendor was a builder (as defined in subsection 123(1) of the ETA) of the House.\ne)Ms. Simonetta did not intend to occupy the property as a place of residence.\nf)Ms. Simonetta and her husband did not actually occupy the Property as a place of residence.\ng)Ms. Simonetta and her husband were not the first individuals to occupy the Property as a place of residence.\nh)Ms. Simonetta did not apply for the New Housing Rebate on a timely basis.\ni)Ms. Simonetta did not use the prescribed form.\nIn other words, the Minister did not assume that any of the circumstances described in subparagraphs a) through i) above existed, nor did the Minister submit that any of subparagraphs a) through i) is a basis for denying the Application.\nC. Nature of Supply [38] Subsection 123(1) of the ETA states that a taxable supply is a supply made in the course of a commercial activity. The same subsection states that a commercial activity includes the making of a supply (other than an exempt supply) by a person of real property of the person. Thus, the sale by the Vendors of the Property was a commercial activity, unless the sale constituted an exempt supply.\n[39] Subsection 123(1) of the ETA states that an exempt supply is a supply included in Schedule V. Section 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the ETA refers to a supply by way of sale of a residential complex by a person who is not a builder of the complex, unless the person claimed an input tax credit (an \u201cITC\u201d) in respect of the last acquisition by the person of the complex (there is also another exclusion, which is not applicable here). In simpler language, the Technical Notes released by the Department of Finance in February 2001 state, \u201cSection 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the Act exempts a sale of a residential complex \u2026 by a person other than a builder.\u201d Thus, a sale of a residential complex by a builder is not an exempt supply. In other words, if a person selling a residential complex is a builder, it is immaterial whether the person claimed an ITC or not.\n[40] It is the position of Ms. Simonetta that the sale by the Vendors to her of the Property was a taxable supply. It is clear that the sale was a supply of real property, such that it was a commercial activity, unless it is established that it was an exempt supply.\n[41] The Crown takes the position that there was not sufficient evidence before the Court to determine whether the Vendors met the definition of builder in subsection 123(1) of the ETA.[40] The Crown also asserts that, apart from the fact that Ms. Simonetta and her family \u201cmoved into a brand-new home,\u201d there was not sufficient evidence before the Court to find that the sale of the Property by the Vendors to Ms. Simonetta was not an exempt supply, and was instead a taxable supply.[41]\n[42] For the sale of the Property by the Vendors to Ms. Simonetta to be a taxable supply, it would need to be shown that the Vendors were builders of the House or that they claimed ITCs in respect of their last acquisition of the Property.[42] In this regard, I note that the Crown did not raise any arguments in its pleadings about the issues of whether the Vendors were builders and whether the sale of the Property was a taxable supply or an exempt supply.\n[43] Turning to the question of whether the Vendors were builders of the House, subsection 123(1) of the ETA states that a builder of a residential complex includes \u201ca person who \u2026 at a time when the person has an interest in the real property on which the complex is situated, carries on or engages another person to carry on for the person \u2026 the construction \u2026 of the complex \u2026 but does not include \u2026 [such] an individual \u2026 who carries on, [or] engages another person to carry on the construction \u2026, otherwise than in the course of a business or an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.\u201d While it appears that the House was not constructed in the course of a business carried on by the Vendors, it is necessary to determine whether the House was constructed in the course of an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.\nD. Adventure in the Nature of Trade [44] For the purposes of these Reasons, I will use the phrase adventure in the nature of trade as meaning an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. As Justice Major said in the Friesen case, \u201cThe concept of an adventure in the nature of trade is a judicial creation designed to determine which purchase and sale transactions are of a business nature and which are of a capital nature.\u201d[43] With the advent of the goods and services tax (the \u201cGST\u201d), the concept of an adventure in the nature of trade also became applicable for certain purposes related to the GST.\n[45] In its traditional income tax context, the determination of whether a particular transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade involves a consideration of whether a particular gain is of an income or capital nature. In Happy Valley Farms, Justice Rouleau enumerated several tests that had been used by the courts to determine whether a gain is of an income or capital nature, as follows:\na)the nature of the property sold;\nb)the length of period of ownership;\nc)the frequency or number of other similar transactions by the taxpayer;\nd)work expended on or in connection with the property realized;\ne)the circumstances that were responsible for the sale of the property; and\nf)motive or intention.[44]\n[46] The above list of factors continues to be used to determine \u201cwhether a gain realized on a disposition of property is an income gain or a capital gain.\u201d[45] The above factors or tests, which are to be applied by reference to the facts of the particular case, \u201cdirectly or indirectly lead back to the intention of the taxpayer.\u201d[46] I will now consider the above six factors.\n(1) Nature of the Property [47] The Property was a large custom-built executive home in an exclusive neighbourhood,[47] with five spacious bedrooms, each with its own ensuite bathroom, a private office with a built-in bookcase, three fireplaces, ten-foot or eleven-foot ceilings,[48] laundry rooms on the main floor and the second floor, a finished basement and a three-car garage.\n[48] As the Property could have been used by the Vendors as their residence or could have been sold with the expectation of making a profit, the nature of the Property is a neutral factor, rather than a determining factor, in this analysis.\n(2) Length of Ownership [49] The Vendors closed the purchase of the Lot and the Original Dwelling on September 1, 2010. In November 2012, the Vendors entered into a Project Management Agreement with Majesty Homes Inc. (\u201cMajesty\u201d), which was hired by the Vendors to be the project manager and builder of the House.[49] On February 13, 2013, without having moved into the Original Dwelling, the Vendors obtained a demolition permit in respect of the Original Dwelling and a construction permit authorizing them to build the House on the Lot.\n[50] In May 2013, after the frost had lifted and the ground had thawed, Majesty began to demolish the Original Dwelling.[50] A couple of months later, Majesty commenced construction of the House. The House was substantially completed by the end of 2014. However, certain items were not entirely completed at that time, and the construction of those items continued up to November 2016.[51]\n[51] The Vendors entered into the first listing agreement on May 29, 2015.\n[52] While the Vendors owned the Lot for slightly more than six years (i.e., September 1, 2010 to November 16, 2016),[52] they owned the House in a substantially completed condition for slightly less than two years (i.e., from late 2014 to November 16, 2016). I consider this to be a relatively short period of time, particularly as the Property was first listed for sale on May 29, 2015, about five or six months after substantial completion of the House.\n[53] While the Vendors encountered a number of challenges in constructing the House, which may explain their decision to sell the House, the short period of ownership of the House is also consistent with an adventure in the nature of trade.\n(3) Use of Borrowed Money [54] In the Friesen case, Justice Major combined the length-of-ownership factor with another factor, namely, the extent to which borrowed money was used to finance a transaction. He stated that \u201cTransactions involving borrowed money and rapid resale are more likely to be adventures in the nature of trade.\u201d[53]\n[55] The Bank advanced to the Vendors the amount of money needed to close their purchase of the Property (less the amount of the down payment that had been put up by the Vendors). It appears that the amount advanced by the Bank on that occasion was in excess of $1,000,000. Based on the evidence, it appears that most, if not all of the money required to demolish the Original Dwelling and to construct the House was borrowed by the Vendors from two corporations owned by the Associate. Based on the available evidence, it also appears that the Associate\u2019s corporations loaned more $3,000,000 to the Vendors to finance the construction of the House.\n[56] At some point in time during the construction of the House, the Bank appears to have lost patience with the amount of time that it was taking for the Vendors to complete the construction of the House. This may have been exacerbated by the litigation between the Bank and the Vendors in respect of some other unrelated transactions. As the Bank was pressuring the Vendors, and perhaps threatening to foreclose, Mr. B arranged with the Associate to borrow additional money in order to pay out a significant portion (if not all) of the amount owed by the Vendors to the Bank. Consequently, one of the Associate\u2019s corporations took over the Bank\u2019s position, as the first secured lender, in respect of a loan with a principal amount (on or about November 16, 2016) of $521,632.16. It appears that the Bank was not paid out entirely, as the Trust Ledger Statement prepared by the Vendors\u2019 solicitor showed that, at the time of closing, the Bank held a fifth mortgage against the Property, with a balance of $223,593.81.[54]\n[57] Ms. Aulicino, writing on behalf of Ms. Simonetta\u2019s lawyers on November 16, 2016, noted that the discharge statements that were provided to Mr. Rigobon in respect of the mortgages registered against the title to the Property showed that the aggregate amount needed to pay out the mortgages exceeded the purchase price of the Property by $1,326,147.58.[55] This suggests that the Property was over-leveraged.\n[58] At the time of closing, the total of the then outstanding balances of the five mortgages registered against the Property was slightly less than $3,800,000. To be fair, at that time the Vendors were holding cash in the amount of $795,010.31, which represented funds that had been advanced to them by one of the Associate\u2019s corporations to finance the construction of the House, but which they had not actually expended. Accordingly, at the time of closing, that amount was repaid by the Vendors, so as to reduce the total of the outstanding balances of the five mortgages to an amount slightly less than $3,000,000.\n[59] Given that the price paid by Ms. Simonetta to purchase the Property was $3,158,000, it is clear that the Vendors used borrowed money to a significant extent to fund their prior purchase of the Lot and the construction of the House. This factor is indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade.\n(4) Frequency or Number of Similar Transactions [60] In June 2010, the Vendors sold the home in which they had been residing, on Lakeshore Boulevard West. Shortly before purchasing the Lot and the Original Dwelling, the Vendors and their family moved into a leased home on Meadowbank Road.\n[61] As noted above, the copy of the Forbearance Agreement (Exhibit R-4) that was originally presented to the Court by Mr. B was incomplete, In particular, the first six recitals to that agreement (as well as other provisions) had been removed by Mr. B. After a more complete copy of the Forbearance Agreement was provided to the Court, it became apparent that some of the removed recitals indicated that sometime on or before April 9, 2009, the Vendors were the owners of real property located on Winterborne Gate in Mississauga. The Winterborne property was mortgaged to the Bank as security for the repayment for various loans advanced by the Bank to the Vendors. In May 2015, the Bank sold the Winterbourne property under a power of sale.\n[62] Thus, during the period from mid-2010 to late 2016, the Vendors disposed of at least three parcels of real property. This could be viewed as a frequency that was consistent with an adventure in the nature of trade.\n(5) Work Expended on the Property [63] In Happy Valley Farms, Justice Rouleau stated that, if effort is put into bringing a property into a more marketable condition during the period of ownership, there is some evidence of dealing in the property.[56] The Vendors put substantial effort into bringing the Property into a more marketable condition, by demolishing the Original Dwelling and by constructing, in its place, the House, which may be described as an upscale residence. While this may be some evidence of dealing in property, it is also consistent with the Vendors\u2019 stated intention that they were building a home for them and their family to live in.[57]\n[64] In commenting on this factor, Justice Rouleau also stated that, if special efforts are made to find or attract purchasers, there is come evidence of dealing in the property.[58] That appears to have been done here. For instance, as persuaded by the Bank, the Vendors chose not to move into the House (even though they claimed that it was to have been their dream home) because they did not want to diminish the saleability of the Property.[59] As well, for some of the time while the Property was listed for sale, it was professionally staged with temporary or imitation furniture.\n[65] Overall, although this factor is generally consistent with the Vendors\u2019 stated intention, this factor is also consistent with an adventure in the nature of trade.\n(6) Circumstances Responsible for the Sale of the Property [66] As explained above, the Vendors encountered a number of difficulties in constructing the House, including opposition from the neighbours, the serious flood in 2013, the subsequent ice storm, and the need to undertake remedial measures to stop the cracking of the neighbours\u2019 foundation and to deal with the resultant lawsuit. Those factors were indicative of a frustrated endeavour to build a family dream home.\n[67] In addition, the Vendors were receiving pressure from the Bank and from the Associate to sell the Property and to pay off the debts that they owed to the Bank and to the Associate\u2019s corporations. As already noted, the pressure from the Bank became so overpowering that the Vendors borrowed additional money from one of the Associate\u2019s corporations in order to pay off some or all of the amount owed by them to the Bank.\n[68] In his submissions on behalf of Ms. Simonetta, Mr. Simonetta suggested that the Vendors were overextended financially. Based on my review of the evidence, that seems to have been the case. It is notable that, while the rate of interest paid by the Vendors to the Bank was in the range of 2% to 3%, the rate of interest paid by them to the Associate\u2019s corporations was 9% in respect of the loan used to pay off the Bank and 10% in respect of the three construction loans (however, it should be noted that Mr. B commented that 10% was a reasonable rate of interest for a construction loan, although no independent evidence was adduced to confirm this comment). It should also be noted that the Vendors were not able to make the anticipated payments in respect of all of the financing provided to them by the Associate\u2019s corporations. In particular, Mr. B acknowledged that, while they initially made monthly payments in respect of the 9% loan that was used to pay off the Bank, those payments ultimately stopped.\n[69] Mr. B testified that the Associate too began to pressure them for repayment of the loans advanced by his corporations. However, the Associate also advised the Vendors that the amount that they could realize on the sale of the Property would be maximized if they were to complete the construction of the House and sell it as a home ready for occupancy, rather than if they were to sell the Lot and the unfinished House shortly after they had decided not to move into it.\n[70] While the Vendors\u2019 hope to live in the House was frustrated, it is also apparent that, when they made the decision not to move into the House, they were determined to complete the construction of the House so as to sell it for the maximum amount possible, in the hope of paying off their debts and making a profit. This factor appears to point in both directions.\n(7) Motive or Intention [71] As was stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Friesen, to constitute an adventure in the nature of trade, \u201cthe taxpayer must have a legitimate intention of gaining a profit from the transaction.\u201d[60] In considering this factor, courts typically determine an individual\u2019s intention at the time of acquiring the particular property.[61] However, as an individual\u2019s intention may change, it may also be necessary to consider the individual\u2019s intention at the time of disposition, as explained by the editors of the Canada Tax Service:\nThe intention test embraces the taxpayer\u2019s intention at the time of acquiring the object of the transaction[,] as well as at the time of its disposition. Thus, it is possible to have an investment intention at the time of acquisition but to have altered that intention and to have become a trader at the time of disposition.[62]\n[72] At the outset of their discussion of No. 170 v. MNR,[63] the editors of the Canada Tax Service state:\nEven if the original intention can be established not to have been for resale at a profit, subsequent events can well prove damaging if they show a change of heart.[64]\nIn No. 170, the corporate taxpayer stressed that, when it acquired the land in question, it did not have the intention of reselling it. However, the evidence showed that the taxpayer undertook expenses to grade the land and to improve it with a water system and roads, and then arranged for a real estate agent to sell parcels of the land. The Tax Appeal Board summarized its analysis as follows:\nIn determining this appeal after a rather prolonged scrutiny of the facts as adduced in evidence, \u2026 it must be noted with what emphasis the appellant has stressed its intention in first acquiring this property. Whatever this original intention may have been it must be found that at some point the appellant abandoned its original purported intention and entered into and engaged in the operation of a business or activity or an adventure in the nature of trade for the purpose of making a profit.[65]\nThe second sentence of the above quotation (confined to the context of an adventure in the nature of trade) can be applied to the Vendors in this Appeal.\n[73] The courts have held that \u201ca clear and unequivocal positive act implementing a change of intention\u201d is required.[66] In my view, that clear and unequivocal positive act occurred when Mr. B\u2019s wife announced, apparently sometime in 2014, that she no longer wanted to live in the midst of neighbours who had treated her and her family so poorly. It seems that thereafter the focus of the Vendors was to complete the construction of the House and to sell it for as much as possible so as to pay off their extensive debts and, as well, to realize a profit.\n[74] During his testimony, when asked whether he thought, amidst the challenges that had arisen, the Vendors might have been able to sell the Property and still make some money on that sale, Mr. B replied:\n\u2026 [T]he original listing was \u2026 $3.6 millions [sic]. Had we sold it for $3.6 millions[,] \u2026 we would have actually done decently. But \u2026 when you are carrying mortgages at 9% and 10%[,] \u2026 you are losing \u2026 $100 and some odd thousand dollars a year, by the [time] it is sold and it sold for \u2026 the equivalent of $3.25 millions [i.e., $3,158,000 plus the real estate commission that Ms. Simonetta\u2019s son did not charge,] it wiped out virtually any chance of profit that we were going to achieve.[67]\n[75] Mr. B then went on to state that the sale process was less about the profit, as they needed to get rid of their debt, because the Bank was leaning on them and the Associate was pushing them.[68]\n[76] It is also noteworthy that, while the Property was listed with the initial realtor (which was between May 29, 2015 and December 30, 2015), the Vendors received an offer that was less than $3,000,000. They rejected that offer, as it was insufficient to cover all of the debts that they had incurred in respect of the Property.[69]\n(8) Weighing of Factors [77] Many of the factors considered above are, in a sense, neutral, as they point in either direction (i.e., a personal residence or a profit-making adventure). For instance:\na)Concerning the nature-of-the-property factor, after the construction of the House, the Property could have been used by the Vendors as their residence or could have been sold with the expectation of making a profit.\nb)Concerning the frequency-or-number-of-similar-transactions factor, it is not uncommon for a growing family to purchase or construct, live in and sell a series of increasingly larger homes. However, the Vendors\u2019 disposition of three residential properties within a relatively short period of time might be indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade.\nc)Concerning the work-expended-on-the-property factor, the work expended by the Vendors on the Property is consistent with both the construction of a residence and the construction of a new house to be sold at a profit.\nd)Concerning the circumstances-responsible\u2013for-the-sale factor, the series of unfortunate events encountered by the Vendors, while constructing the House, provide a reasonable explanation for the sale of the Property. However, the failure to occupy the House and the steps taken to maximize the selling price are indicative of a profit-seeking intention.\n[78] On the other hand, one factor in particular, i.e., the extensive use of borrowed money, clearly points to an adventure in the nature of trade.\n[79] As Justice Margeson noted in Freer, a case considering whether a purchase and a subsequent sale of real property were an adventure in the nature of trade, \u201cthe statement of the parties alone as to their avowed intention at the time of purchase of the properties is at best tenuous without further corroboration.\u201d[70] Furthermore, in some cases, \u201cthe question of credibility [looms] large.\u201d[71]\n[80] Thus, in addition to considering the above factors, I am also cognizant of the misrepresentations made by the Vendors, through their solicitor, when, in the face of specific observations made by the Simonettas and mentioned by Ms. Aulicino in her letter of November 16, 2016, the Vendors baldly stated that they had owned the property for five years (when it was actually in excess of six years), that they had occupied the House as their residence, and that they had certified the sale of the Property as not being subject to HST. Mr. B acknowledged that the first two statements were incorrect, and the Crown has acknowledged that the third statement was incorrect.[72]\n[81] Having carefully considered the evidence and having weighed the above factors, it is my view that the Vendors had a change of intention in 2014, whereupon they embarked upon an adventure in the nature of trade. Consequently, it is my view that the Vendors were builders of the House, within the meaning of subsection 123(1) of the ETA.\nE. Paragraph 7 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale\n[82] As noted above, the relevant portion of paragraph 7 of the APS reads as follows:\nHST: If the sale of the Property \u2026 is subject to Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), then such tax shall be included in the Purchase Price. If the sale of the Property is not subject to HST, Seller agrees to certify on or before closing that the sale of the Property is not subject to HST.[73]\n[83] As I have found that the Vendors were builders of the House, their sale of the Property to Ms. Simonetta was subject to HST. Furthermore, the Vendors did not certify that the sale of the Property was not subject to HST. This too suggests that the operative portion of paragraph 7 of the APS is the first sentence, rather than the second sentence. Consequently, Ms. Simonetta understood that the HST was included in the price that she paid for the Property.\n[84] Ms. Simonetta\u2019s understanding of paragraph 7 of the APS is consistent with the general custom of advertising prices of new homes on a modified tax-included basis.[74]\nF. Taxable Supply [85] For the reasons discussed above, I conclude that the sale of the Property by the Vendors to Ms. Simonetta was a taxable supply, and not an exempt supply.\nG. Primary Place of Residence [86] I accept the testimony of Mr. Simonetta and Ms. Simonetta that, after Ms. Simonetta purchased the Property, they occupied the Property as their primary place of residence. At the time of the hearing of this Appeal, they continued to use the Property as their primary place of residence.\nH. Payment of HST [87] The Crown takes the position that, because the Statement of Adjustments in respect of the sale and purchase of the Property did not break out or show the HST as a separate amount, there was no payment of HST by Ms. Simonetta to the Vendors. However, the Statement of Adjustments clearly shows that the sale price in respect of the Property was $3,158,000. There was no dispute about whether the sale price was paid to the Vendors (if the price had not been paid, the transaction would not have closed and Ms. Simonetta would not have been given possession and ownership of the Property).\n[88] As the sale of the Property was a taxable supply, and not an exempt supply, the first sentence, and not the second sentence, of paragraph 7 of the APS is the applicable provision. The first sentence of paragraph 7 clearly states that the HST was to be included in the purchase price. Thus, by paying the price, Ms. Simonetta also paid the HST.\nI. Transfer of Ownership [89] Paragraph 254(2)(e) of the ETA requires that ownership of the Property must have been transferred to Ms. Simonetta after the construction thereof had been substantially completed. As noted above, an occupancy permit was issued by the City of Toronto indicating that the work had been completed on or before November 15, 2016, and that the Property was suitable for occupancy as of that date. The closing of the sale and purchase transaction occurred on a subsequent date. Thus paragraph 254(2)(e) was satisfied.\nJ. No Previous Occupancy [90] Subparagraph 254(2)(f)(i) of the ETA requires that, after the construction of the House was substantially completed and before possession of the Property was given to Ms. Simonetta under the APS, the Property cannot have been occupied by an individual as a place of residence. As discussed above, I am satisfied that this condition was met.\nK. First Occupancy of the Property [91] Subparagraph 254(2)(g)(i) of the ETA requires that the first individual to occupy the Property as a place of residence after substantial completion of the construction of the House must have been Ms. Simonetta or one or more of her relations. The evidence was clear that Ms. Simonetta and her husband moved into the House and occupied the Property as their residence, and that no one else had previously occupied the Property as a place of residence.\nL. Summary\n[92] Based on the above analysis, Ms. Simonetta satisfied all the requirements of subsection 254(2) of the ETA in order to qualify for the Rebate.\nM. Sufficiency of Application Form [93] Subsection 262(1) of the ETA provides that an application for a new housing rebate must be made in prescribed form containing prescribed information and must be filed with the Minister in prescribed manner. It is my understanding that the only concern that the Crown has in respect of this statutory requirement is that section D of the Application filed by Ms. Simonetta did not give any information concerning the builder, i.e., the Vendors. Section D of the prescribed form indicates that the requisite information consists of the builder\u2019s name, business number (if any), address and telephone number. As noted above, by attaching a copy of the Statement of Adjustments to the Application, Ms. Simonetta did provide the CRA with the names of the Vendors.\n[94] Section D also asks the question \u201cDid the builder either pay the amount of the rebate directly to the purchaser or credit it against the total amount payable for the house?\u201d Although Ms. Simonetta did not answer that question, it is clear, based on the evidence at the hearing, that the answer to the question is \u201cNo.\u201d\n[95] Section D also calls for the signature of the builder.\n[96] Mr. Simonetta testified that he was the one who completed the Application on behalf of his wife and that, based on the responses given by the Vendors\u2019 solicitor in the two letters referenced above, he (Mr. Simonetta) was certain that the Vendors would not cooperate in providing the outstanding information called for in section D or in signing the Application.\n[97] I am not aware of any jurisprudence that has previously considered the question of what a new home purchaser should do when the vendor refuses to cooperate in submitting the rebate application form. At the hearing, counsel for the Crown helpfully noted that perhaps some guidance might be provided by the cases dealing with an employer who uncooperatively refuses to provide a Declaration of Conditions of Employment (Form T2200), as required by subsection 8(10) of the Income Tax Act.[75]\n[98] In this regard, in the Brochu case, Justice Boyle, in obiter dicta, stated:\n\u2026 it may be possible that in exceptional circumstances a paragraph 8(1)(h.1) claim could succeed if an employer unreasonably refused, or was unable, to complete and sign a T2200 form\u2026.[76]\n[99] In Kreuz, Justice D\u2019Auray implied that, if an employer fails to provide Form T2200 to an employee claiming business expenses, it may be sufficient if the employee establishes that the employer acted unreasonably or in bad faith in not providing the form.[77]\n[100] In Chao, Deputy Judge Jorr\u00e9 (as he then was) referred to the maxim that \u201cthe law does not require the impossible,\u201d[78] and stated that, \u201cif the maxim applies, it is clear that a very high standard of effort to comply with the law would be required of the taxpayer\u2026,\u201d meaning that the taxpayer \u201cwould need to make the efforts that a careful, diligent person who is aware of their legal obligations would make\u2026,\u201d and \u201cit would have to be shown that the employer acted unreasonably or in bad faith\u201d in failing to provide the form.[79] In a footnote, Deputy Judge Jorr\u00e9 noted that the requisite efforts of a careful, diligent person do not require \u201cextreme ingenuity, superhuman effort, nor massive unusual resources to comply with an Act.\u201d[80]\n[101] At the hearing, Mr. Simonetta stated that it would have been pointless for him to have requested the business number (if any), address and telephone number of the Vendors, let alone ask them to sign the Application, given the correspondence that had already been exchanged by their respective solicitors. As noted above, the Vendors declined to provide any documentation (such as utility bills, driver\u2019s licences and health cards) to show that they actually had resided in the House (as they claimed). Furthermore, Mr. Rigobon wrote to the Vendors\u2019 solicitor on December 15, 2016, to reiterate that the Property constituted \u201ca new home construction for the purposes of the appropriate tax legislation,\u201d and to advise that Ms. Simonetta intended to apply for the Rebate unless another arrangement could be worked out.[81] Rather than explain his clients\u2019 position or engage in a dialogue about the nature of the supply of the Property for HST purposes, the Vendors\u2019 solicitor did no more than curtly state that his clients had advised that the sale of the Property was not subject to HST (which was a position that the Vendors had formulated after talking to their real estate agent, and without consulting a tax adviser).[82] It was apparent from the solicitor\u2019s response that, if Ms. Simonetta were to have sent the Application to the Vendors for their signatures, they would have refused to sign it.\n[102] The Simonettas were also aware that the Vendors, through their solicitor, had made three misrepresentations (i.e., the Simonettas knew that the number of years that the Vendors had owned the Property was something other than five, that the Vendors had not occupied the Property as their residence, and that the Vendors had not certified that the sale of the Property was not subject to HST). Given the nature and content of the correspondence from the Vendors\u2019 solicitor, it would have been unreasonable to expect Ms. Simonetta to go back to the Vendors again and ask them to complete and sign the Application. I am of the view that, in those circumstances, Ms. Simonetta could not have reasonably been expected to obtain the cooperation and signatures of the Vendors, and that this would be an appropriate situation in which to apply the maxim \u201cthe law does not require the impossible.\u201d\n[103] Accordingly, I have determined that this is one of those rare situations where a recipient of a taxable supply of a new residential complex is unable to obtain all of the information needed to complete section D of the application form for the new housing rebate. In my view, the Vendors acted unreasonably in not providing Ms. Simonetta with either the documentation necessary to confirm that they had (as they alleged) occupied the House as their residence, or alternatively, an explanation of their position, or further in the alternative, an acknowledgement in November 2016 (rather than in November 2021, during the course of the trial) that they had not lived in the House. It is also my view that, by reason of the Vendors\u2019 uncooperative attitude and disingenuous conduct, as evidenced by the curt, dismissive responses from their solicitor and the misrepresentations in the solicitor\u2019s letter of November 17, 2016, it was not possible for Ms. Simonetta to obtain the business number (if any), address, telephone number and signatures of the Vendors. Therefore, Ms. Simonetta\u2019s inability to obtain that information and those signatures does not vitiate her Application for the Rebate.\nIV. CONCLUSION [104] This Appeal is allowed, with costs, to be determined in accordance with sections 10 and 10.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Excise Tax Act (Informal Procedure).\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 9th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDon R.

It is important to note that the word builder, as used in the undated letter from Majesty to the Bank (which is the first page of Exhibit R-2 and which is attached to the Project Management Agreement), does not have the same meaning as the word builder, as used in subsection 123(1) of the ETA. For the purposes of the ETA, a person may be a builder of a residential complex without actually performing the construction of the complex. In other words, in some situations, the term builder includes a landowner who engages another person to construct a residential complex. As well, subsection 123(1) also provides that the term builder includes a person who is engaged by a landowner to carry on the construction of a residential complex on that land.\n[50] Transcript, vol. 2, p. 63, lines 14-21.\n[51] Exhibit A-1, tab 9.\n[52] The originally scheduled closing date was to have been November 16, 2016; however, due to a delay in discharging one or more mortgages, the transaction actually closed a couple of days later.

Introduction\n[1] The Appellant filed an application for a Goods and Services Tax\/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST\/HST) New Housing Rebate for owner-built houses (Application) in respect of a property located at 4400 Donato Dr., Lasalle, Ontario (Property). The Application was for a total rebate amount of $22,570.82 representing the Ontario provincial new housing rebate (Rebate).\n[2] By notice of assessment dated June 3, 2021, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) denied the Rebate.\n[3] In filing her appeal before this Court, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal referring to the following reason in support of the appeal (emphasis added):\nGST\/HST New Housing Rebate Appeal\nBased on subsection 256(2), we personally built this home for residential purposes, and decided to sell our home for certain reasons. These reasons include losing my job due to the pandemic, and my spouse losing a job opportunity also due to the pandemic. We made a personal decision to sell our home regarding the inability to afford all of the expenses. We built this home ourselves for the only purpose of it being our primary residence, as we provided all the proof in our initial application. We were the first individuals to occupy the complex after the construction, and therefore qualify for the rebate. We have provided all of the necessary proof, and we are glad to provide any more if needed.\n[4] In filing the Reply, the Respondent provided its position in respect of the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal (emphasis added):\n1. With respect to the first sentence of the Notice of Appeal, the Attorney General:\na. admits that a home was built;\nb. admits that the Appellant and her spouse sold the home;\nc. denies that the Appellant and her spouse intended to live in the home as a residence;\n\u2026\n4. With respect to the fourth sentence of the Notice of Appeal, the Attorney General admits that the Appellant and her spouse built the home, but denies that the only purpose for building the home is for it being their primary residence, and states that the balance of sentence is advanced primarily by way of argument or relief sought and denies any allegation of facts incidentally contained therein.\n\u2026\n[5] In addition, the Respondent confirmed in section 13 of the Reply the following assumptions of fact made by the Minister in assessing the Appellant\u2019s Application:\na) on March 14, 2019, the Appellant and her spouse purchased vacant land located at 4400 Donato Dr, Lasalle, N9H 0L5 Ontario (the \u201cLand\u201d) for the sale price of $210,000;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\nb) the Appellant\u2019s father owns Superior Custom Builders, a corporation;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\nc) on April 23, 2019, construction began on a house on the Land (collectively the \u201cProperty\u201d);\n[admitted by the Appellant]\nd) Superior Custom Builders and Precision Roof Truss Ltd (the \u201cCorporations\u201d) paid the expenses for the construction of the house on the Property;\n[denied by the Appellant]\ne) on March 20, 2020, the Appellant and her spouse listed the Property for sale;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\nf) on June 9, 2020, the Appellant lost her employment due to the global pandemic;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\ng) on June 10, 2020, the construction of the house on the Property was completed;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\nh) in November 2020, the Appellant sold the Property to a third party;\n[admitted by the Appellant]\ni) the Appellant and her spouse\u2019s annual employment income did not significantly change in 2020; and\n[denied by the Appellant as stated]\nj) the Appellant and her spouse did not live in the Property.\n[denied by the Appellant]\n[6] When asked to confirm her position in respect of each of the Minister\u2019s assumption in section 13 of the Reply, the Appellant admitted as true most assumptions, except assumptions in paragraphs d), i) and j).\n[7] In essence, Mrs. Hammoud denied the statement in paragraph i) above because she believes that the word \u201csignificantly\u201d is inappropriate. In the absence of detailed explanations from the Appellant, the Court understands that she is of the view that their total 2020 annual income changed more than what the Minister thought. However, no credible evidence was provided at the hearing to support her position in this regard.\n[8] Paragraphs d) and j) above are denied by the Appellant as she does not agree with the Minister\u2019s position. The hearing dealt with these two points.\n[9] The Appellant testified on her behalf and she was cross-examined by the Respondent. The Appellant also called her spouse as a witness. The examination in chief of her spouse was for a few questions. His cross-examination by the Respondent was longer.\n[10] The Respondent did not call any witnesses.\nII. Issue in dispute\n[11] This appeal deals with the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the Rebate, and more particularly, whether in connection with the Property, the conditions in paragraphs 256(2)(a) and (c) of the Excise Tax Act, RSC 1985, c E-15, as amended (Act) and paragraphs 46(2)(a) and (b) of the New Harmonized Value-Added Tax System Regulations, No. 2, SOR\/2010-151 (Regulations) have been satisfied.\n[12] In the event that all conditions are met, the appeal should be allowed. However, if one of these conditions is not met, the appeal should be dismissed.\n- Respondent\u2019s position\n[13] The Respondent is of the view that the Appellant and her spouse did not construct the house for use as their primary place of residence for purposes of paragraphs 256(2)(a) of the Act and 46(2)(a) of the Regulations, or alternatively, the Appellant and her spouse did not pay the HST claimed in the Application in respect of the supplies of improvements to the house as required under paragraphs 256(2)(c) of the Act and 46(2)(b) of the Regulations. During the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the Respondent described the two arguments as the Appellant and her spouse did not (i) intend to use the house as the primary place of residence and (ii) pay tax in respect of the supply regarding improvements to the house.\n[14] According to the Respondent, the Appellant must make out a prima facie case to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions of facts to show on a balance of probabilities that the assessment is not correct. The facts of the case do not support a favorable conclusion for the Appellant. In addition, the Respondent believes that the HST was not paid by the Appellant and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing did not support the HST treatment claimed by the Appellant in the Application.\n[15] The Respondent did not raise other reasons or conditions to support that the appeal should be dismissed.\n- Appellant\u2019s position\n[16] The Appellant\u2019s position is that both conditions raised by the Respondent are satisfied and as required by subsection 256(2) of the Act. The Appellant and her spouse were the first to reside in the house. It always been their intention to build the house for the Appellant, her spouse and their family. Moreover, the Appellant submits that they paid the HST claimed as rebate in the Application.\nIII. Context and evidence at the hearing\n[17] At the beginning of her testimony, the Appellant was invited to introduce the reasons that led to the Appeal (emphasis added):\nOkay. So, basically, me and my husband built a home starting from -- in 2019, before the pandemic, and we built the home for ourselves with the sole intention of it being our primary residence.\nIt ended up being that the pandemic hit us. I had lost my job. There were -- I guess beginning of 2020 is when, you know, Covid started happening and, from there, I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to, most likely, keep my job, just by how it was at work and in the health field.\nAnd we rely on both of our incomes so in -- down the line, we decided that it was best that we sold the house due to the fact that we were not able to keep up financially with the bill payments and the tax payments just because it ended up being a lot more than what we thought it would be.\nAnd especially then going down to only one income, it became really hard, so we decided it\u2019s the best choice to sell the house, and that -- we ended up selling it before the whole market went crazy as well so we were just kind of unsure of how things are going to happen in the year due to the pandemic because it was -- at that time, that\u2019s when it was at the most unsure and, you know, scary part, so we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. We didn\u2019t want to risk anything so we decided to sell the house.\nAnd this whole thing was just us trying to get the rebate -- the tax rebate on all of the payments that we made to build the house because we did build the house just ourselves, just us two, me and my husband. \u2026\n[18] The Appellant and her spouse purchased on March 14, 2019 a vacant lot in Lasalle, Ontario. The house was subsequently built on that lot. At the time the vacant lot is purchased, the Appellant and her spouse lived in Windsor, Ontario. The purchase of the vacant lot by the Appellant and her spouse on March 14, 2019 is not in dispute.\n[19] At the hearing, the Appellant raised some confusion about the position of the Respondent in the Reply with respect to whether the Appellant and her spouse built the house on the vacant lot. The Respondent admitted they did, but denied that the only purpose for building the home was for it to be their primary place of residence. The construction of the house started in April 2019 and ended in June 2020 for a total construction period of about 15 months.\n[20] The Appellant confirmed during her cross-examination that the occupancy date of the Property was September 15, 2019. The Appellant confirmed that they were the first to live in the Property.\n[21] At the beginning of the construction period, the domicile address of the Appellant and her husband was still 4525 Osaka Circle, Windsor, Ontario.\n[22] During her testimony, the Appellant reconfirmed that they first listed the Property for sale in March 2020. Later during her cross-examination, and although the Appellant admitted at the outset the Minister\u2019s assumption in paragraph 13e) of the Reply that the Property was listed for sale on March 20, 2020, she later said that she did not want to say the wrong date, and when asked whether the listing was prior to the end of the construction June 10, 2020 she said she does not remember.\n[23] On June 9, 2020, the Appellant lost her employment due to the global pandemic. The Appellant was clear about that date. However, when asked to confirm when she returned to work, the answer was not clear. She was sure she did not return to work during the summer of 2020. Most likely during the fall of 2020, but she could not recall when and did not want to mention any period.\n[24] The Court was made aware that the sale of the Property was subject to an Amendment to Agreement of Purchase and Sale dated September 30, 2020 and ultimately transferred to the purchaser in November 2020.\n[25] On October 23, 2020, the Appellant filed the Application and claimed the Rebate. The Rebate relates exclusively to the Ontario provincial new housing rebate.\n[26] The Appellant filed a total of 13 exhibits at the hearing. Seven exhibits were filed to support that the Appellant and her spouse were living in the Property at the particular date referred to in each such exhibit. Only one exhibit with one document relating to the purchase of the vacant land, two quote sheets, and two invoices for a total amount of $14,166.36 was filed to justify the payment of construction bills for the house.\n[27] No exhibit was filed by the Appellant contemporaneous with the Property moving date (September 15, 2019), neither in connection with the 4525 Osaka Circle, Windsor, Ontario they allegedly left to live in the Property. Bank Deposit Account Transaction Enquiry sheets were also filed as exhibits. These exhibits, although referring to a supplier, did not allow the Court to draw any conclusion in the absence of documents in support of the bank sheets.\n[28] During the Appellant\u2019s cross-examination, the Respondent questioned the Appellant on the expenses claimed on the Application in respect of the construction of the house. Fifteen invoices submitted by the Respondent were addressed during the cross-examination. Most questions were about who paid the invoice, who is the client on the invoice, the purpose and the circumstances surrounding the invoice. In almost every case, the Respondent raised issues with the identity of the client name and the credit card holder.\n[29] The exhibits filed by the Appellant showing that the Property was occupied by the Appellant and her spouse consisted in bills for natural gas, electricity, bank statements, driver\u2019s licence, licence plate, insurance brokers correspondence, internet service, pharmacy prescription receipt and car insurance slip representing expenses or documents showing the Appellant\u2019s name or the name of the Appellant\u2019s spouse and the Property address with respect to various periods between October 28, 2019 and November 19, 2021.\nIV. Analysis\n- applicable law\n[30] In order to qualify for a rebate under sections 256 of the Act and 46 of the Regulations, the Appellant must satisfy, inter alia, the two conditions in dispute and set out in paragraphs 256(2)(a) and (c) and 46(2)(a) and (b) of the Regulations: [1]\n256\n[\u2026]\n(2) Where\n(a) a particular individual constructs or substantially renovates, or engages another person to construct or substantially renovate for the particular individual, a residential complex that is a single unit residential complex or a residential condominium unit for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual,\n[\u2026]\n(c) the particular individual has paid tax in respect of the supply by way of sale to the individual of the land that forms part of the complex or an interest therein or in respect of the supply to, or importation by, the individual of any improvement thereto or, in the case of a mobile home or floating home, of the complex (the total of which tax under subsection 165(1) and sections 212 and 218 is referred to in this subsection as the \u201ctotal tax paid by the particular individual\u201d),\n[\u2026]\nthe Minister shall, subject to subsection (3), pay a rebate to the particular individual equal to \u2026\n[emphasis added]\n46. Rebate in Ontario\n(2) If\n(a) an individual is entitled to claim a rebate under subsection 256(2) of the Act in respect of a residential complex that the individual has constructed or substantially renovated, or has engaged another person to construct or substantially renovate, and that is for use in Ontario as the primary place of residence of the individual or a relation of the individual, or the individual would be so entitled if the fair market value of the complex, at the time the construction or substantial renovation of the complex is substantially completed, were less than $450,000, and\n(b) the individual has paid all of the tax payable by the individual in respect of the supply by way of sale to the individual of the land that forms part of the complex or an interest in the land or in respect of the supply to, importation by, or bringing into Ontario by, the individual of any improvement to the land or, in the case of a mobile home or floating home, of the complex (the total of which tax under subsection 165(2) and sections 212.1, 218.1 and 220.05 to 220.07 of the Act is referred to in this subsection and subsection (4) as the \u201ctotal tax in respect of the province\u201d),\n\u2026\n[31] Subsection 299(3) of the Act states that an assessment, subject to being vacated on an objection or appeal and subject to a reassessment, shall be deemed to be valid and binding.\n[32] Generally, in tax appeals, the burden of proof rests on the appellant. The appellant bears the burden of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his or her position including that the assessment or reassessment is not correct. [2]\n[33] In Hickman Motors Ltd. v Canada, [1997] 2 SCR 336 L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. confirms that the initial onus on the taxpayer consists in demolishing the assumptions relied upon by the Minister to make the assessment. If the taxpayer puts forward at least a prima facie case, the burden of proof shifts to the Minister, who must prove the assumptions relied upon and rebut the prima facie case.\n[34] A prima facie case is generally supported by evidence which raises such a degree of probability in its favour that it must be accepted if believed by the Court unless it is rebutted or the contrary is proved.\n[35] In Eisbrenner, Justice Webb on behalf of the Federal Court of Appeal bench, reaffirmed the conclusions he reached in Sarmadi:\n\u2026 In Sarmadi, I reviewed the various cases that have discussed the onus of proof issue. I also reviewed the context of an appeal to the Tax Court. I concluded that:\n[61] In my view, a taxpayer should have the burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, any facts that are alleged by that taxpayer in their notice of appeal and that are denied by the Crown. In most cases this should end the discussion of the onus of proof since the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in reassessing the taxpayer would generally be inconsistent with the facts pled by the taxpayer with respect to the material facts on which the reassessment was issued.\n[62] If there are facts that were assumed by the Minister in reassessing a taxpayer and that are not inconsistent with the facts as pled by that taxpayer, it would also seem logical to require the taxpayer to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that these facts assumed by the Minister (and which are in dispute and are not exclusively or peculiarly within the Minister\u2019s knowledge) are not correct. Requiring a taxpayer to disprove the facts assumed by the Minister in reassessing that taxpayer simply puts the onus on the person who knows (or ought to know) the facts. It also puts the onus on the person who indirectly asserted certain facts in filing their tax return that would be inconsistent with the facts assumed by the Minister in reassessing such taxpayer.\n[63] Once all of the evidence is presented, the Tax Court judge should then (and only then) determine whether the taxpayer has satisfied this burden. If the taxpayer has, on the balance of probabilities, disproven the particular facts assumed by the Minister, based on all of the evidence, there is no burden to shift to the Minister to disprove what the Tax Court judge has determined that the taxpayer has proven. Either the taxpayer has disproven the assumed facts or he, she or it has not.\n[25] In paragraph 36 of Sarmadi, I had also noted that if the Minister alleges a fact that is not part of the facts that were assumed by the Minister in assessing a taxpayer or in confirming an assessment, then the Minister will have the onus of proof with respect to such facts (Her Majesty the Queen v. Loewen, 2004 FCA 146 at para. 11, 2004 D.T.C. 6321). [3]\n[emphasis added]\n[36] In Kufsky, supporting the reasons of Justice Webb in Eisbrenner, Monaghan JA wrote:\n[99] In these reasons, I have chosen to refer to a prima facie case. That phrase has been used repeatedly to describe what a taxpayer challenging the Minister\u2019s assumptions must do. Some commentary suggests that prima facie case is intended to mean something less than \u201con a balance of probabilities\u201d. I am not convinced and endorse the approach Justice Webb outlined in Sarmadi v Canada, 2017 FCA 131, 2017 D.T.C. 5081, at paras. 61\u201363, repeated in Eisbrenner v. Canada 2020 FCA 93, leave to appeal to the SCC dismissed 2020 S.C.C.A. No. 334. However, for the Appellant\u2019s benefit, I have assumed that a prima facie case requires something less than a balance of probabilities. Nonetheless, she has failed.\n[37] In Van der Steen, a unanimous decision, the Federal Court of Appeal confirms Eisbrenner:\n26 In Eisbrenner v Canada, 2020 FCA 93, this Court confirmed that a taxpayer who pleads a particular fact in his, her or its notice of appeal to the Tax Court has the onus of proving that fact on a balance of probabilities when the Crown denies that allegation of fact. Mr. van der Steen would know whether he had the necessary donative intent in order for the payment of $65,000 to CLES to qualify as a charitable donation.\n[38] In Hong Kong Style Caf\u00e9 Ltd. v The Queen, 2022 TCC 9, Justice Bocock referring to Justice McPhee in Xue v HMQ, 2020 TCC 72 on Eisbrenner:\n36 In Eisbrenner v Canada (2020 FCA 93 (F.C.A.)), the Federal Court of Appeal recently reviewed, the burden of proof upon an Appellant before the Tax Court. A taxpayer has the burden to prove any facts that are alleged by that taxpayer in their Notice of Appeal and that are denied by the Respondent.\n37 Particular to tax appeals is the ability of the Respondent to plead and rely upon the assumptions made by the Minister. When this occurs, the taxpayer in order to be successful in their appeal, needs to demolish the properly plead assumptions that are detrimental to the appeal. In the Reply filed in this matter, several key assumptions were set and relied upon by the Respondent as part of their evidence. Few, if any, of the assumptions were specifically dealt with in the evidence lead by the Appellants.\n[emphasis added]\n[39] Justice Bowman, as he then was, in Cadillac Fairview Corp. Ltd. v The Queen, [1996] 2 CTC 2197 wrote:\nThe appellant pleaded that the payments were made pursuant to the guarantees and this allegation was denied. Counsel for the appellant argued that since the Minister had not pleaded that he \u201cassumed\u201d that the payments were not made pursuant to the guarantees the Minister had the onus of establishing that the payments were not made pursuant to the guarantees. The question is, if not a pure question of law, at least a mixed one of law and fact. In any event the basic assumption made on assessing was that the appellant was not entitled to the capital loss claimed and it was for the appellant to establish the several legal components entitling it to the deduction claimed. \u2026 I do not believe that Minister of National Revenue v. Pillsbury Holdings Ltd. 1964 CanLII 1197 (CA EXC), [1964] C.T.C. 294, [1964] D.T.C. 5184, has completely turned the ordinary rules of practice and pleading on their head. The usual rule\u2014and I see no reason why it should not apply in income tax appeals\u2014is set out in Odgers\u2019 Principles of Pleading and Practice, 22nd edition at page 532:\nThe \u201cburden of proof\u201d is the duty which lies on a party to establish his case. It will lie on A, whenever A must either call some evidence or have judgment given against him. As a rule (but not invariably) it lies upon the party who has in his pleading maintained the affirmative of the issue; for a negative is in general incapable of proof. Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat. The affirmative is generally, but not necessarily, maintained by the party who first raises the issue. Thus, the onus lies, as a rule, on the plaintiff to establish every fact which he has asserted in the statement of claim, and on the defendant to prove all facts which he has pleaded by way of confession and avoidance, such as fraud, performance, release, rescission, etc.\n[40] For the purposes herein, the foregoing summary means that the Appellant must prove at trial, on the balance of probabilities, not only the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact that the Appellant believes to be unfounded, but also the allegations of fact pleaded in the Notice of Appeal in support of her position to the extent the Respondent does not admit them.\n[41] On that basis, the Court can now determine whether the Appellant satisfied her burden of proof under paragraphs 256(2)(a) and (c) of the Act and 46(2)(a) and (b) of the Regulations, knowing that if one of these conditions is not met, the Rebate must be denied.\n- primary place of residence \u2013 256(2)(a) of the Act\/46(2)(a) of the Regulations\n[42] In the present case, paragraph 256(2)(a) of the Act requires an individual to construct or engage another person to construct for the individual, a \u201csingle unit residential complex\u201d for use as the individual\u2019s primary place of residence or the primary place of residence of the individual\u2019s relation.\n[43] For the following reasons, the Court finds that the Appellant has not successfully met her burden of proof under paragraph 256(2)(a) of the Act.\n[44] First, an individual must construct a unit. Subsection 123(1) of the Act defines an \u201cindividual\u201d as a natural person. Therefore, a natural person must construct or engage another person (who can be someone other than a natural person) to construct a unit. The Appellant is a natural person. The Respondent admitted that the Appellant and her spouse built the house on the vacant land. Therefore, this sub-condition is met.\n[45] Second, the unit must be a \u201csingle unit residential complex\u201d, which is defined in subsection 256(1) of the Act to include a detached house, a detached house with a suite or, possibly, a duplex. This second sub-condition does not create an issue in the present case.\n[46] Third, the purpose of the construction of the unit by the individual must be to use the unit as the primary place of residence of the individual or of his or her relation. A \u201crelation\u201d includes individuals connected by blood relationship, marriage or common-law partnership or adoption. Again, the relation requirement does not raise any issue in the present case.\n[47] The concept of \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d is not defined in the Act. Whether the Appellant had the requisite intention at the relevant time is a question of fact. [4] This sub-condition will be met if the Appellant has convinced the Court that she had the correct intention at the relevant time regardless of whether she actually followed through on that intention. For purposes of paragraph 256(2)(a) of the Act, the relevant time is during the construction period of the house. This is the sub-condition the Court found the Appellant has failed to prove on the balance of probabilities.\n[48] Actual use of the property may be evidence in some cases of the taxpayer\u2019s intention; however, it is not conclusive. [5] The Tax Court has held that a variety of indicia can be considered to determine whether the subjective intent is supported across the waypoints of occupancy:\ni) demarcation of primary place of residence by change of address;\nii) the relocation of sufficient personal effects to the rebate property;\niii) if no occupancy of the residence, was there cogent evidence of frustration of occupancy;\niv) permanent occupant insurance versus seasonal or rental coverage;\nv) delivery of possession of previous primary residence to another;\nvi) if dual occupancy continues, then the rebate property must be more frequently occupied, more convenient to third party locations such as work, more convenient amenities and more suitable to the needs of the taxpayer. [6]\n[49] However, ultimately, what is required is:\n[7] In the end, there are numerous decisions, each turning on their own facts, on the issue of a purchaser\u2019s intention to acquire a residence as a \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d for the purposes of the rebate. A clear and settled intention to occupy the premises as a \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d, considered in the context of an individual\u2019s personal, family and work-related circumstances. A tentative, fleeting or whimsical intention does not suffice.\n[8] Parliament\u2019s use of the word \u201cprimary\u201d also suggests that the purchaser must have a settled intention to centre or arrange his personal and family affairs around that property. The rebate is not intended for a secondary residence or \u201cpied-\u00e0-terre\u201d. An individual can own multiple residences but would typically have only one \u201cprimary place of residence\u201d. [7]\n[50] The fact that the Appellant may or may not live in the house is distinct from the intention that could motivate the Appellant to construct the house. In fact, the condition in paragraph 256(2)(d) of the Act relates specifically to the occupation of the house. This is the reason why the inherent fact of living in the house is insufficient to establish that the Appellant had the correct intention that paragraph 256(2)(a) of the Act prescribes.\n[51] Based on the burden of proof discussion above, and considering that the Appellant added in her pleading in the Notice of Appeal that the intention was to built the house for the only purpose of it being their primary place of residence and the Respondent denied that fact in the Respondent\u2019s Reply, the Appellant bears the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that she built the house for use as her primary place of residence.\n[52] Only once all of the evidence at the hearing is presented, can the Court then determine whether the Appellant has satisfied this burden. [8]\n[53] The intention of the Appellant was put forward through the testimony of the Appellant and her spouse. Both testified having built the house with the intent of living in the house. As mentioned earlier, some documentary evidence was also submitted to show that they moved in at a certain date.\n[54] However, the offer for sale of the Property in March 2020 and the credibility issues relating to the Appellant\u2019s testimony and raised in theses reasons below seriously impact, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the conclusion that the Appellant has satisfied her burden of proof.\n[55] The Court\u2019s impression on the merit of the additional comments made by the Appellant about the initial listing in March 2020 is to associate the Appellant\u2019s comments with the Appellant\u2019s statements made about her impossibility to remember the period she returned to work although she was clear about when she lost her employment in June 2020. No details were provided about her employment research and success. This situation leaves the Court unconvinced about a complete transparency and untainted testimony by the Appellant including with respect to the Appellant\u2019s additional remarks about the initial listing date. In the Court\u2019s opinion, these positions adopted by the witness result in a negative inference about the witness\u2019s credibility.\n[56] During her cross-examination, the Appellant confused the credit card used to pay most construction invoices filed as exhibits by the Respondent. She confirmed the credit card being her spouse\u2019s old credit card, while during his cross-examination by the Respondent her spouse confirmed the credit card holder being either his father-in-law or mother-in-law (the Appellant\u2019s father and mother). In the Court\u2019s opinion, this factor also contributed to a negative inference in light of her credibility.\n[57] Also, during her testimony, the Appellant described the circumstances and the reasons that motivated the couple to do business with the suppliers of Superior Custom Builders and Precision Roof Truss Ltd. In summary, when asked to explain why she and her spouse would be responsible for not paying the suppliers, she said that the suppliers would call her husband (emphasis added):\nAlthough the name of Superior Custom Builders was there, \u201cIt just shows -- like, they\u2019ll put \u201cSuperior Custom Builders\u201d because we just gave the name showing that, you know, we are going to come -- basically, giving a business like that is just kind of saying we\u2019re going to be coming for the next time if we decided to build, because we were thinking maybe down the future, if we ever wanted to build again \u2026 that\u2019s basically what we said to them when we were purchasing and it\u2019s just, like, you get a minor discount just because it\u2019s almost like a promise that, you know, you\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll buy our flooring again from them \u2026 [9]\n[58] This response leaves the Court confused as to the genuine intention behind the construction of the house and the decision to offer for sale the house during construction in March 2020. The last paragraph of the Appellant\u2019s statement in paragraph 17 above leads the Court to raise the same uncertainty.\n[59] In Martinuzzi, Justice Rip, as he then was, found that the appellant, who had purchased land and built a residence on the property, did not intend to use it as a primary place of residence. [10] The house was for sale during the construction and Justice Rip did not \u201cbelieve that the installation of a \u2018For Sale\u2019 sign on the property during construction was a \u2018joke\u2019\u201d.\n[60] In the present case, the offer for sale of the Property during construction has proved to be irreconcilable with the intention to use it as the primary place of residence as required by applicable statute.\n[61] The Court is of the view that the Appellant did not succeed, on the balance of probabilities, to establish that the Appellant\u2019s intention to construct the house was for use as her primary place of residence.\n[62] According to the Court, the Appellant was not able to establish the key facts through the evidence on record at the end of the hearing that support her position and for that reason she failed to satisfy paragraph 256(2)(a) of the Act and 46(2)(a) of the Regulations.\n[63] Moreover, the Appellant testified that the reasons for selling the Property were that she lost her employment due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, her spouse lost a job opportunity due to the pandemic, and they felt they could not afford all the expenses, the bills, the taxes, and also having to pay for groceries, and the overall cost of living. According to the Appellant, it wasn\u2019t really reasonable at that point.\n[64] In Fard, Deputy Judge Masse referring to Sozio [11] held that in order to invoke frustration as an excuse for a failure to actually use the rebate property as a primary place of residence, the surrounding circumstances must be such as to make the frustrating event unforeseeable, beyond the buyer\u2019s control, and results in the absence of real choice such that it makes living primarily and habitually at the rebate property impossible. [12]\n[65] The surrounding circumstances to be considered for a finding of frustrated intent must be the circumstances existing at the appropriate time. In the present case, the appropriate time is the first evidence that the intention might not be as announced by the Appellant about her intention to use the Property as the primary place of residence.\n[66] The Court believes the March 2020 listing, which is about 11 months after the construction began and 3 months before the end of the construction period, to be that first evidence. The Appellant\u2019s answer to a clear question \u201cMs. Hammoud, you listed the property at 4400 Donato Drive in March of 2020?\u201d was \u201cYes\u201d. The subsequent attempts by the Appellant to specify the exact date of the listing and the possibility of a listing month later in 2020 appear to the Court more like a distraction. The later attempts were not convincing and were not supported by other evidence or by circumstances that the Court could rely on. The Appellant did not advance any other date or period for the decision to sell the Property. For the Court, the Appellant\u2019s attempts were too vague and proved inconclusive.\n[67] In March 2020, at the time the Appellant offers the Property for sale, the evidence shows very few unforeseeable events for the Appellant and her spouse except for the fact that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The expenses, taxes and bills relating to the Property were foreseeable, no employment was lost at that time. The electricity bills filed as exhibits by the Appellant for the period of July 24, 2019 to October 24, 2019 (3 bills) show a total of 140 kWh compared to 239 kWh for the period of February 24, 2020 to March 17, 2020 (the period of October 25, 2019 to February 23, 2020 was not filed) and to a total of 1,390 kWh for the period of August 17, 2020 to November 23, 2020. To the extent these bills are prior to March 2020, they do not show any excess material considerations.\n[68] The confirmation of the pandemic in March 2020 created uncertainties for many Canadians, the impact of which likely varied from one person to another. In the present case, the Appellant had to submit evidence about the direct impact the pandemic imposed on her as early as in the first weeks the pandemic was confirmed. The reason for that is because the Property was offered for sale that month. As mentioned in Fard and Sozio, the Appellant had the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that, in March 2020, the pandemic created a situation such as the Appellant had no real choice such that it makes living primarily and habitually at the Property impossible.\n[69] In her Notice of Appeal filed with this Court on April 19, 2022, the Appellant referred to the pandemic causing her lost of employment (confirmed by a letter dated June 9, 2020) and her spouse losing a job opportunity (no details were provided at the hearing). No other reference is made to \u201cCOVID\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d in the Notice of Appeal.\n[70] During her testimony, the Appellant referred two times to \u201cCOVID\u201d referring first to justify her lost of employment and second to justify that they accepted the first purchase offer for the Property. The word \u201cpandemic\u201d was pronounced 10 times by the Appellant during the hearing. Eight times during her testimony and cross-examination, and twice during her submissions. The eight times pronounced by the Appellant were in reference to (i) the fact that the construction of the house started before the pandemic, (ii) mention that she lost her employment, (iii) early in the pandemic they were not sure about the impact the pandemic could have on them so it created uncertainties, and (iv) uncertainties after she lost her employment and she returned to work during the pandemic. During her submissions, the Appellant referred twice to the pandemic as being responsible for her employment lost.\n[71] During the testimony of the Appellant\u2019s spouse, \u201cCOVID\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d was not mentioned.\n[72] There are few doubts that the pandemic had negative impacts on the Appellant, including some effect of her decisions and choices. Unfortunately, from the evidence submitted during the hearing, the Court finds difficult to identify factors that created an impact as early as in March 2020 including from the pandemic that could prove, on the balance of probabilities, the absence of real choice such that it makes living primarily and habitually at the rebate property impossible. Essentially, the Appellant linked the pandemic during the hearing to her employment lost, which ultimately materialized in June 2020, and the fact that the pandemic raised uncertainties for them. No clear or undisputed evidence was submitted by the Appellant to crystallize the absence of real choice whether or not to live in the Property. The element of not having any choice but to sell has not been proven on the balance of probabilities.\n[73] Also, no evidence was submitted by the Appellant supporting a quick sale of the Property or a sale subject to unfavourable conditions for the Appellant.\n[74] Regrettably, the lack of evidence combined with the weakness of the evidence filed by the Appellant either documentary or by testimony, as a whole, are responsible for the Appellant not having been able to satisfy the burden of proof.\n[75] Considering the foregoing, the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Appellant is not entitled to claim the Rebate as the Appellant and her spouse did not construct the Property for use as their primary place of residence for purposes of paragraphs 256(2)(a) of the Act and 46(2)(a) of the Regulations shall prevail.\n[76] On that basis, the Appellant\u2019s appeal cannot, unfortunately, succeed.\n[77] There is no need to address the condition in paragraphs 256(2)(c) of the Act and 46(2)(b) of the Regulations.\nV. Conclusion [78] For all the reasons described above, the appeal against the Appellant\u2019s assessment made by notice dated June 3, 2021 is dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, this 10th day of May 2023.\n\u201cJ.M.

The Regulations prescribe a rebate, payable pursuant to section 256.21 of the Act, calculated as prescribed, where the test set out in subsection 46(2) of the Regulations has been met. The test in subsection 46(2) of the Regulations is the requirements outlined in subsection 256(2) of the Act.\n[2] The burden of proof in tax appeals was more recently discussed in various decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Tax Court of Canada. Justice Webb in Sarmadi v The Queen, 2017 FCA 131 [Sarmadi] reviewed the law on burden of proof in tax appeals, but Justice Stratas and Justice Woods declined to provide a definitive opinion on this same issue. In Eisbrenner v The Queen, 2020 FCA 93 [Eisbrenner], Justice Webb, on behalf of the Federal Court of Appeal bench, reiterated the same line of reasons with respect to the burden of proof in tax appeals. The application for leave to appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada in Eisbrenner was dismissed (January 14, 2021). Since the Eisbrenner decision, the reasons of Justice Webb on the issue of the burden of proof in tax appeals have been confirmed or referred to in at least 4 other decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal: Kufsky v Canada, 2022 FCA 66 [Kufsky], Chibani v Canada, 2021 FCA 196, European Staffing Inc. v Canada (National Revenue), 2020 FCA 2019 and Van der Steen v Canada, 2020 FCA 168 [Van der Steen].

INTRODUCTION [1] The appellant has filed a motion seeking to have the two above-named appeals consolidated pursuant to Rule 26 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure). In the alternative, they seek an order that the matters proceed on the same timetable and be heard together on common evidence.\n[2] The respondent opposes consolidation but agrees that the two matters should proceed on the same timetable.\nII. THE LAW Rule 26\n[3] Rule 26 states:\n26 Where two or more proceedings are pending in the Court and\n(a) they have in common a question of law or fact or mixed law and fact arising out of one and the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences, or\n(b) for any other reason, a direction ought to be made under this section,\nthe Court may direct that,\n(c) the proceedings be consolidated or heard at the same time or one immediately after the other, or\n(d) any of the proceedings be stayed until the determination of any other of them.\nEffect of Consolidation\n[4] Consolidation has the effect of merging the appeals from a procedural point of view. The consolidated appeals will proceed as if they were a single appeal for the purpose of all the procedural steps in the appeal.\n[5] However, the underlying appeals are not consolidated. Each appeal of an assessment remains a separate appeal in relation to the merits of the assessment.\n[6] This is clearly explained by Justice Webb of the Federal Court of Appeal in 3488063 Canada Inc. v. Canada[1] where he says:\n[52] However, the Rules can operate to consolidate or merge the appeals in relation to the procedural steps that will be applicable to all of the appeals that are the subject of a consolidation order. As a result, any appeals that are consolidated will proceed as if they are one appeal for the purposes of the Rules and each procedural step under the Rules will apply equally to each appeal that is part of the consolidated proceedings so that, for example, one list of documents would apply to all of those appeals.\n[53] However, the underlying assessments are not consolidated. Therefore, each appeal of a particular assessment (or reassessment) remains as a separate appeal in relation to the merits of the assessment (or reassessment), although the procedural steps, as provided in the Rules, apply concurrently to all of the appeals that are consolidated.\nPurpose of Consolidation\n[7] The purpose of a consolidation order is \u201cthe avoidance of a multiplicity of proceedings and the promotion of expeditious and inexpensive determination of those proceedings.\u201d[2]\nThreshold for Considering Consolidation and Factors to Consider\n[8] The preconditions to consideration of an order under Rule 26 are relatively modest. There must be (under Rule 26(a)):\na common question of fact or\na common question of fact of law or\na common question of fact and law\nor (under Rule 26(b)):\nsome other reason why a direction ought to be made.\n[9] If the threshold is met the Court will consider the merits of issuing an Order, or not, pursuant to Rule 26.\n[10] In Apotex Inc. v. Bayer Inc.[3], Justice Nadon of the Federal Court of Appeal explains:\n[46] In determining whether an order sought under rule 105 [the Federal Court rule for Consolidation] should be made, the Court must consider a number of factors, namely, the commonality of parties, issues, facts and remedies. The Court must also consider whether prejudice will result from the making of the order \u2026 In a number of decisions, the Federal Court has held that no order of consolidation should be made where prejudice would result from the order. It is also well established that the onus rests with the moving party to show that it would not be abusive or prejudicial to make the order sought \u2026 Thus, it is clear that, while prejudice is not the only consideration relevant to a determination under rule 105, it carries great weight. To this, I would add that the nature and severity of the prejudice are of obvious relevance.\n(Citations omitted)\n[47] In my view, the above principles are not restricted to orders for consolidation but also apply to other rule 105 orders like the one under appeal where it is determined that two or more proceedings are to be heard together on all issues or on common issues only. I see no basis for distinguishing between consolidation orders and orders like the impugned order in this regard.\n(Citations omitted)\n[11] What factors are relevant and what weight they are to be given may vary in the circumstances.\nIII. ANALYSES\n[12] In these appeals:\nThe parties are the same and counsel are the same.\nThe ultimate issues are different in the appeals. In one appeal, the issues relate to the deductibility of certain expenses whereas the other appeal relates to whether or not withholding tax and related penalties were properly assessed. The remedies, if any, will relate to different kinds of assessments.\nThere will likely be a fair amount of overlap in the testimonial and documentary evidence, given that, based on the allegations in the pleadings, it appears that in two of the years in issue a majority of the disputed expenses are also the subject of the dispute with respect to withholding on the related payments. Much of the background information will be common to both appeals.\n[13] Rule 26(b) is disjunctive. It is not obligatory that all, most, or even any of the questions be common to the appeals for which consolidation is sought. Indeed, given Rule 26(b) substantial overlap in the evidence alone may be sufficient to justify consolidation in circumstances, where the benefits clearly outweigh the disadvantages.\n[14] Given the identity of the parties and the overlap in evidence, it will be efficient to have the appeals proceed as if they were one for all procedural purposes. Consolidation would not create add any significant complexity to pre-trial stages of the appeal or to the hearing. Further, consolidation would not cause any prejudice to the Respondent.\n[15] This is an appropriate case for consolidation.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n[16] Accordingly, the appeals will be consolidated and the parties shall file a new timetable for both appeals.\n[17] Costs will be in the cause.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 4th day of May 2023.\n\u201cG.

Introduction: [1] This appeal addresses a Requirement to Pay (Requirement), issued per subsection 244(1) of the federal Income Tax Act (Act) - a garnishment provision. It was issued to a corporation wholly owned by the tax debtor identified in the Requirement. Does the Requirement apply respecting cash withdrawals made by that tax debtor from his corporation\u2019s bank account?\n[2] Subsections 244(1) and (4) and paragraph 227(1)(a) of the Act provide:\nSubsection 224(1): [Garnishment] \u2013 Where the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a party is, or will be within one year, liable to make a payment to another person who is liable to make a payment under this Act (in this subsection\u2026 referred to as the \u201ctax debtor\u201d), the Minister may in writing require the person to pay forthwith, where the monies are immediately payable, and in any other case as and when the monies become payable, the monies otherwise payable to the tax debtor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the tax debtor\u2019s liability under this Act. (underlining added)\nSubsection 224(4): [Failure to comply with subsection (1), (1.2) or (3) requirement] \u2013 Every person who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection 224(1), 224(1.2) or 224(3) is liable to pay to Her Majesty an amount equal to the amount that the person was required under subsection 224(1), 224(1.2) or 224(3), as the case may be, to pay to the Receiver General. (underlining added)\nParagraph 227(10)(a): [Assessment] - The Minister may at any time assess any amount payable under\n(a) subsection\u2026224(4) or 224(4.1)\u2026by a person\u2026\n[3] The appellant corporation, 2405124 Ontario Ltd. (240 Ontario), has one Ian Bodnar (IB) as its directing mind, being its president, sole shareholder and sole director. Additionally, IB thinks that he is the only person having signing authority re 240 Ontario\u2019s bank account.[1]\n[4] 240 Ontario appeals the assessment of $23,410 that the Minister of National Revenue raised per paragraph 227(10)(a) of the Act (set out above). The respondent Crown contends that 240 Ontario did not comply with a subsection 244(1) Requirement issued May 31, 2017 to 240 Ontario and received June 2, 2017.\n[5] The respondent pleads that the Minister assessed inter alia on the assumption that on fifteen occasions between June 2, 2017 and December 22, 2017 inclusive, with the said Requirement in effect, tax debtor IB withdrew cash totalling $23,410 from 240 Ontario\u2019s bank account, as follows:[2]\n1. June 2, 2017 - $2,000\n2. June 9, 2017 - $2,000\n3. June 30, 2017 - $1,000\n4. July 14, 2017 - $360\n5. July 19, 2017 - $3,000\n6. August 4, 2017 - $500\n7. August 10, 2017 - $300\n8. September 11, 2017 \u2013 $500\n9. September 20, 2017 - $200\n10. September 26, 2017 - $200\n11. October 12, 2017 - $4,000\n12. November 21, 2017 - $350\n13. December 14, 2017 - $5,000\n14. December 20, 2017 - $3,000\n15. December 22, 2017 - $1,000\nTotal $23,410.\nII. Issue: [6] The issue pleaded by the appellant 240 Ontario[3] is whether $23,410 was payable and ultimately paid by it to the tax debtor IB, for purposes of subsections 224(1) and 224(4). The respondent\u2019s pleaded issue[4] is similarly whether the Minister was justified in assessing $23,410 pursuant to subsection 224(4).\n[7] At the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that the question was \u201cwhether or not the [15] payments of the withdrawals were in fact paid to [IB]\u201d while the Requirement was in effect.[5] Respondent\u2019s counsel identified the issue as, \u201cwhether the appellant failed to comply with a requirement to pay issued under subsection 224(1) of the [Act] and as a result was assessed\u2026\u201d[6]\nIII. Evidence\/Facts: [8] IB was the only witness at the hearing. He did not take issue with the Minister\u2019s assumption that he had a tax liability of $121,116 under the Act when the subject assessment was raised. The notice of assessment provides that the assessment, \u201cis issued in respect of the liability under subsection 224(4) and\/or 224(4.1) of the [Act]\u2026 for failure to comply with [the said Requirement] re: Ian Bodnar..\u201d.[7]\n[9] The said Requirement inter alia required the following of 240 Ontario:\nYou are required to pay to the Receiver General on account of [IB\u2019s tax] liability under [the Act]:\n1) forthwith, the moneys otherwise and immediately payable to the [tax debtor, IB] which you are required to pay;\n2) all other moneys otherwise payable to the [tax debtor, IB] which you will be, within one year, liable to pay, as and when the moneys become payable\u2026\n[10] The legal basis for the first of these two Requirement provisions is subsection 224(1), set out above. Breach of that provision leads to liability to the Crown per subsection 224(4) that may be assessed per paragraph 227(10)(a).\n[11] IB testified that 240 Ontario\u2019s business was real estate purchase and sale. Also, 240 Ontario earned no income in 2017 due to IB\u2019s then significant health situation. IB had no employment relationship with 240 Ontario and it had never paid him remuneration, nor dividends. IB\u2019s sole 2017 income was from CPP and OAS payments. He testified that 240 Ontario\u2019s bank account, in a local credit union, where everyone knew him, was \u201cjust used for paying all the expenses of [itself].\u201d[8]\n[12] He testified also that 240 Ontario had expenses including utility invoices (propane gas, water) and upkeep charges (his example was mowing grass) and that because 240 Ontario had no income in 2017 it borrowed funds from another credit union account, this one held in the name of IB\u2019s spouse, Ms. Bodnar.\n[13] Borrowed funds were transferred in 2017 from Ms. Bodnar\u2019s account to 240 Ontario\u2019s account in amounts including $35,617.60 in July, secured by a party ally hand-written demand promissory note signed by IB for both 240 Ontario and himself. He wrote on it that \u201cI have authority to bind the corporation\u201d, meaning 240 Ontario. Other amounts transferred in 2017 from the account held in Ms. Bodnar\u2019s name into 240 Ontario\u2019s account included $10,000 (August), $15,000 (August), $5,000 (October), $5,000 (November) and $79,000 (December).\n[14] The $79,000 was needed for purchase of a property 240 Ontario was obligated to buy.\n[15] IB testified that the above listed fifteen withdrawals from 240 Ontario\u2019s sole bank account were to make payments due on two Canadian Tire MasterCard credit card accounts, both registered in Ms. Bodnar\u2019s name. As well, IB had two credit cards for his use, both of which were registered as sub-accounts of Ms. Bodnar\u2019s two credit card accounts. All the credit card accounts relating to this matter ultimately were registered, whether directly or indirectly, in Ms. Bodnar\u2019s name.\n[16] In redirect examination appellant\u2019s counsel asked IB, \u201c[Y]ou were authorized to use these credit cards [of Ms. Bodnar] for what purposes?\u201d His answer was, \u201cFor whatever I needed it for.\u201d[9]\n[17] Essentially the funds that IB withdrew from 240 Ontario\u2019s bank account were used to pay for purchases he (and perhaps also other family members) had made, using credit cards registered to Ms. Bodnar\u2019s Canadian Tire MasterCard accounts.\n[18] Ms. Bodnar was not present to testify regarding any of this. IB said she was home ill that day. According to testimony of IB, Ms. Bodnar was a central player in all this. Respondent\u2019s counsel objected several times as to her non-presence and requested that I presume from her absence that her evidence would not have aided the appellant, 240 Ontario.\n[19] The evidence also was that numerous purchases by IB using the MasterCard credit cards registered to his wife, did not seem as likely business expenses of 240 Ontario. For example, there were charges to various dining establishments shown on the credit card statements. IB was not taken through these statements to explain how individual expenses on the credit card statements were expenses of 240 Ontario.\n[20] Of concern to me, no receipts pertaining to the charges listed on the several credit card statements were put into evidence. Credit card transactional receipts would have much clarified the nature of individual expenses. As it is, I expect there would not be many charges over several months for an inactive corporation such as 240 Ontario, holding real estate.\n[21] Additionally regarding credit card receipts, respondent\u2019s counsel asked IB, \u201cDo you have any detailed receipts here that can indicate what was purchased on the card?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, no.\u201d[10]\n[22] Counsel asked, \u201cYour answer that you don\u2019t have any detailed receipts, this applies to both MasterCards?\u201d He answered, \u201cThat\u2019s correct, yes.\u201d[11]\n[23] IB testified that he personally made most of the subject fifteen cash withdrawals from 240 Ontario\u2019s account. He testified he would attend at the credit union where that bank account was kept, and at the counter, with his bank card, authorize a withdrawal with consequently a clerk providing to him the quantum of cash that he was withdrawing from 240 Ontario\u2019s account.\n[24] His testimony was that typically he then would attend at the local Canadian Tire location to tender the withdrawn cash as payment against either or both of his wife\u2019s two Canadian Tire Bank credit card accounts, being the principal accounts for credit cards of which he had unrestricted usage. The evidence showed almost completely a match of the respective fifteen withdrawn sums with amounts shortly subsequently tendered to Canadian Tire Bank, during the latter half of 2017 when the Requirement had effect.\n[25] IB testified that due to his health situation (by-pass surgery in early July 2017 in Hamilton and wheelchair bound recovery into August), each of the several subject cash withdrawals during that July \u2013 mid-August period were made by his wife or one or other of his children whom I take to be young adults. I understand that each such withdrawal, using IB\u2019s bank card and PIN, would have to have been authorized by him. IB said nothing to indicate otherwise. Again Ms. Bodnar was not there to testify, and neither were either of the young adult children.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Positions: [26] Appellant\u2019s counsel cited Majorca Inc. v. R., 98 DTC 1130 (TCC) in which liability was found where withdrawn corporate funds were used to pay credit card accounts of a tax debtor. Counsel distinguished this from the present case in which funds of the appellant were used to pay credit card accounts of the tax debtor\u2019s spouse Ms. Bodnar, rather than for credit card accounts of the tax debtor IB himself - of which there were none. Counsel noted also that Ms. Bodnar was a creditor of 240 Ontario. Counsel submitted that this strengthened 240 Ontario\u2019s submission that the cash withdrawals from its account were for Ms. Bodnar\u2019s benefit and thus not in breach of the Requirement.\n[27] Respondent\u2019s counsel submitted that subsection 224(1) spoke of a person\u2019s liability to make a payment to another person who was a tax debtor under the Act. She urged that subsection 224(1) be broadly construed, per National Trust Co. v. R., 98 DTC 6409, FCA. It was not just to apply in a debtor\u2011creditor relationship but to any situation in which there was \u201ca responsibility at law to make a payment to the tax debtor\u201d.[12]\n[28] Respondent\u2019s counsel referenced the numerous credit card purchases at chain restaurants and locations including EB Games, Sports Check, Canadian Tire and Mark\u2019s Warehouse, as well as IB\u2019s statement that he was authorized to use the credit cards authorized under his wife\u2019s accounts for whatever he needed. Counsel submitted that IB used \u201chis spouse\u2019s [credit cards] to make his daily purchases and pay for his activities and other related hobbies.\u201d[13] She submitted also that at least on one occasion the withdrawal amount ($500, August 4, 2017) was not used to pay Ms. Bodnar\u2019s credit card accounts.\n[29] Respondent\u2019s counsel further submitted that 240 Ontario and Ms. Bodnar acted as agents or nominees of the tax debtor IB who was able to use credit cards on his wife\u2019s accounts for his own purposes. His wife\u2019s credit card accounts were reimbursed for this by payments made to those credit card accounts using funds withdrawn from 240 Ontario\u2019s account mostly by IB (and during July to mid\u2011August withdrawn by wife and\/or young adult children on instructions from IB, due to his health situation. It was his bank card and PIN that needed to be used.)\nV. Analysis: [30] I find the appealed assessment to be valid. It was rightly issued per subsection 224(1), set out above. That provision applies in respect of moneys paid by a Requirement recipient (here, 240 Ontario) to a tax debtor identified in the Requirement (here, IB). Subsection 224(1) requires that any money payable to the tax debtor, be instead paid to the Receiver General, on account of the tax debtor\u2019s income tax liability.\n[31] Jurisprudence has established that the subsection 224(1) language \u201cliable to make a payment\u201d applies where there is responsibility at law to make a payment. The provision is not restricted to debtor-creditor relationships. See Discovery Trust Company v. Abbott et al, [1982] B.C.W.L.D. 1454 (B.C.S.C.) and National Trust Co. v. R., [1998] F.C.J. No. 968 (F.C.A.)\n[32] Here, I find that 240 Ontario did have responsibility at law to make payments to IB from available funds, such responsibility arising from IB\u2019s ownership of and authority over 240 Ontario. IB is 240 Ontario\u2019s directing mind, being its sole shareholder, sole director and sole officer (president), as well as sole signing officer.\n[33] This control and authority exists regardless that IB also is the very tax debtor referenced in the subject Requirement issued to 240 Ontario May 31, 2017. If IB requests funds from 240 Ontario, 240 Ontario is compelled to comply given IB\u2019s authority and control over it as its directing mind, sole owner and sole signing officer. There is no exception as to withdrawal of funds.\n[34] On the fifteen occasions the withdrawn funds passed either directly to IB or indirectly to him during the July to mid-August period due to his then temporary health situation. During that said period, the several instances of withdrawn funds occurred on IB\u2019s authority via a family member acting as agent on his behalf, provided with temporary usage of his bank card and PIN to access the account. Interpreting subsection 224(1) broadly, that is sufficient to establish liability for non-compliance with the Requirement, as the withdrawn sums were not remitted to the Receiver General.\n[35] What IB went on to do with the funds (having not remitted same to the Receiver General) is irrelevant to establishment of liability per the Requirement. 240 Ontario paid to him, directly or indirectly, funds on the fifteen noted occasions, totalling the assessed amount of $23,410.\n[36] Parenthetically I note that effectively the appellant 240 Ontario - IB\u2019s own corporation of which he was sole shareholder and director \u2013 was used as a conduit to fund payment of IB\u2019s expenses, incurred through unrestricted usage of credit cards registered in his wife\u2019s name. Why otherwise would 240 Ontario be involved in paying off Ms. Bodnar\u2019s monthly credit card statements.\nVI. Conclusion: [37] As stated, I find the appealed assessment to be valid. This informal procedure appeal will be dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 5th day of May 2023.\n\u201cB.

This appeal concerns the proper application of the GST\/HST self-supply rules following the construction and initial occupancy of that facility.\n[2] The Appellant wishes, in essence, to re-argue the decision of this Court in High-Crest Enterprises Limited v. The Queen.[1] The Appellant says that High-Crest was wrongly decided. It says that judicial comity does not require me to reach the same conclusion that Justice Jorr\u00e9 reached in that appeal.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I will dismiss the appeal. In all material respects, the facts of this appeal are identical to the facts in High-Crest.[2] There is no need for me to consider whether judicial comity requires me to follow High-Crest as I entirely agree with Justice Jorr\u00e9\u2019s conclusions. This alone would be a sufficient basis for me to dismiss the appeal.\n[4] The following reasons highlight additional concerns that I have with the Appellant\u2019s arguments beyond those already covered in High-Crest. To the extent that the Appellant has raised an argument that I have not explicitly dealt with below, that is because it has already been dealt with in High-Crest and I adopt the reasoning therein.\nA. Background [5] The background to this appeal is relatively straight forward. The parties filed a detailed Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, a copy of which is attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d. The following is a summary of the key facts.\n[6] The Appellant had operated a long-term care facility for seniors in Windsor, Nova Scotia for many years. That facility was aging. Rather than renovate the existing facility, the Appellant decided to build a new facility in nearby Falmouth (the \u201cFacility\u201d).\n[7] The Appellant submitted a proposal to the Nova Scotia Department of Health for the Appellant to build and operate the Facility. The Department of Health accepted the proposal.\n[8] The Appellant then signed two agreements with the Department of Health. The first agreement was a Development Agreement. The Development Agreement set out the terms upon which the Appellant was to develop the Facility. Those terms included entering into a second agreement known as the Service Agreement. The Service Agreement set out the services that the Appellant would provide through the Facility and the payments that it would receive from both the Nova Scotia government and the Facility\u2019s residents.\n[9] The Appellant purchased land for the Facility and began construction. The Facility consisted of 107 long-term care rooms and one respite room. Construction was substantially completed in the autumn of 2010. The first resident moved into the Facility that November.\n[10] The Appellant was a GST\/HST registrant. It claimed input tax credits of $4,240,937 related to the purchase of the land and the construction of the Facility.\n[11] When the first resident moved into the Facility, the Appellant determined that it had had a deemed self-supply of the Facility under subsection 191(3) of the Excise Tax Act. The Appellant reported GST\/HST collectible of $2,950,000 on the deemed self-supply.\n[12] If certain conditions are met, section 191.1 deems the GST\/HST collectible on a self-supply under subsection 191(3) to be equal to the input tax credits claimed by the registrant during construction. The Minister of National Revenue concluded that those conditions had been met. The Minister also concluded that the Appellant had reported the self-supply in the wrong reporting period.\n[13] The Minister assessed the Appellant to move the self-supply from the Appellant\u2019s reporting period from January 1 to March 31, 2011 to its reporting period from October 1 to December 31, 2010. The Minster also applied section 191.1 to increase the GST\/HST collectible on the self-supply to equal the $4,240,937 in input tax credits that the Appellant had claimed.\n[14] The Appellant has appealed those assessments.[3]\nB. Issue [15] The sole issue is whether section 191.1 applies to deem the GST\/HST collectible on the self-supply to be equal to the input tax credits claimed by the Appellant.\nC. Deeming Provisions [16] Sections 191 and 191.1 are both deeming provisions. Section 191 deems a self-supply to have occurred if certain conditions are met. Section 191.1 deems a certain amount of GST\/HST to have been collected on that self-supply if certain further conditions are met.\n[17] While section 191 can apply on its own, section 191.1 only applies if section 191 has first applied. Therefore, to determine whether section 191.1 applies in the Appellant\u2019s case, it is important to first understand how section 191 came to apply to the Facility.\nD. Section 191 [18] The parties agree that there was a deemed self-supply from the Appellant (as the builder of the Facility) to the Appellant (as the operator of the Facility) pursuant to subsection 191(3).\n[19] In the reporting periods in issue, the relevant portions of subsection 191(3) read as follows:\n191(3) For the purposes of this Part, where\n(a) the construction\u2026a multiple unit residential complex is substantially completed,\n(b) the builder of the complex\n(i) gives, to a particular person \u2026 possession or use of any residential unit in the complex under a lease, licence or similar arrangement entered into for the purpose of the occupancy of the unit by an individual as a place of residence,\n\u2026, and\n(c) \u2026the particular person\u2026is the first individual to occupy a residential unit in the complex as a place of residence after substantial completion of the construction or renovation,\nthe builder shall be deemed\n(d) to have made and received, at the later of the time the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed and the time possession or use of the unit is so given to the particular person or the unit is so occupied by the builder, a taxable supply by way of sale of the complex, and\n(e) to have paid as a recipient and to have collected as a supplier, at the later of those times, tax in respect of the supply calculated on the fair market value of the complex at the later of those times.\n[20] In the circumstances of this appeal, the following tests must have been met for subsection 191(3) to apply. The parties agree that all of these tests were met.\n(a)Multiple Unit Residential Complex: The Facility must have been a \u201cmultiple unit residential complex\u201d. The term \u201cmultiple unit residential complex\u201d is defined in subsection 123(1) as a \u201cresidential complex\u201d that contains more than one \u201cresidential unit\u201d. The terms \u201cresidential complex\u201d and \u201cresidential unit\u201d are also defined in subsection 123(1).\n(i)Residential Unit: The definition of \u201cresidential unit\u201d includes a room in a residence for seniors that has never been used or occupied but is intended to be used as a place of residence for individuals. This describes the state of the rooms in the Facility immediately before occupation.\n(ii)Residential Complex: In simple terms, a \u201cresidential complex\u201d is that part of a building in which one or more residential units are located together with the underlying land and related common areas.\nIn summary, the Facility consisted of 108 residential units that, together, formed a residential complex which was, in turn, a multiple unit residential complex.\n(b)Builder: The Appellant must have been the \u201cbuilder\u201d of the Facility. The term \u201cbuilder\u201d is defined in subsection 123(1). In simple terms, the Appellant was the builder of the Facility because it had an interest in the real property on which the Facility was situated and either constructed the Facility or hired someone else to do so for it.\n(c)Substantial Completion: Construction of the multiple unit residential complex must have been substantially complete. This occurred in the final quarter of 2010.\n(d)Possession or Use: The Appellant must have given possession or use of one of the residential units in the Facility to a particular person under a lease, licence or similar arrangement. This occurred in November 2010.\n(e)Purpose of Occupancy as a Place of Residence: The lease, licence or similar arrangement must have been entered into \u201cfor the purpose of the occupancy of the unit by an individual as a place of residence\u201d.\n(f)First Occupancy: The person who was given possession or use of the residential unit under the lease, licence or similar arrangement must have been the first individual to occupy a residential unit in the complex as a place of residence after substantial completion of the construction.\n[21] Because all of these tests were met, the Appellant was deemed to have made and received a taxable supply by way of sale of the Facility and to have paid as a recipient and collected as a supplier tax in respect of that supply. In other words, the Appellant was deemed to have supplied the Facility to itself. Absent subsection 191.1, that supply would be deemed to have occurred at fair market value.\nE. Section 191.1 [22] The purpose of section 191.1 is to prevent builders who have benefited from government funding from ending up better off financially from the self-supply rules than they would have if the rules did not exist. As described by Justice Jorr\u00e9, section 191.1 \u201cseeks to deny a net tax refund on the self-supply by bumping up the [GST\/HST collectible] where there is government support for the provision of residential accommodation to the groups of individuals described in the section.\u201d[4]\n[23] In the reporting periods in question, the relevant parts of section 191.1 read as follows:\n191.1(1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\u201cgovernment funding\u201d, in respect of a residential complex, means an amount of money (including a forgivable loan but not including any other loan or a refund or rebate of, or credit in respect of, taxes, duties or fees imposed under any statute) paid or payable by\n(a) a grantor\u2026\n\u2026\nto a builder of the complex\u2026for the purpose of making residential units in the complex available to individuals referred to in paragraph (2)(b).\n\u201cgrantor\u201d means\n(a) a government\u2026\n\u2026\n(2) For the purposes of subsections 191(1) to (4), where\n(a) a builder of a residential complex\u2026is deemed under any of subsections 191(1) to (4) to have, at any time, made and received a supply of the complex\u2026,\n(b) possession or use of at least 10% of the residential units in the complex is intended to be given for the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence or lodging by\n(i) seniors,\n\u2026, and\n(c)\u2026the builder, at or before that time, has received or can reasonably expect to receive government funding in respect of the complex,\nthe amount of tax in respect of the supply calculated on the fair market value of the complex\u2026is deemed to be equal to the greater of\n(d) the amount that would, but for this subsection, be the tax calculated on that fair market value, and\n(e) the total of all amounts each of which is tax that was payable by the builder in respect of\n(i) real property that forms part of the complex or addition, as the case may be, or\n(ii) an improvement to that real property.\n[24] In the circumstances of this appeal, the following tests must have been met for section 191.1 to apply:\n(a)Deemed Self-Supply: The Appellant must have been deemed to have made a self-supply of the Facility under subsection 191(1) to (4). As set out above, the parties agree that this test is met. The Appellant was deemed to have made a self-supply under subsection 191(3).\n(b)Possession or Use by Seniors: The Appellant must have given possession or use of at least 10% of the residential units in the Facility to seniors. The parties agree that this test is met.\n(c)For the Purpose of Occupancy as a Place of Residence: The Appellant must have given possession or use of those residential units to the seniors \u201cfor the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence\u201d. The Appellant says this test has not been met.\n(d)Government Funding: There must have been \u201cgovernment funding\u201d of the Facility. That term is defined in subsection 191.1(1). In the circumstances of this appeal, \u201cgovernment funding\u201d means an amount of money paid or payable by a \u201cgrantor\u201d to a builder of a residential complex \u201cfor the purpose of making residential units in the complex available\u201d to seniors. The Appellant says this test has not been met. The parties agree that the government of Nova Scotia acting through the Department of Health is a \u201cgrantor\u201d. They agree that the Department of Health paid substantial sums to the Appellant each year under the Service Agreement. However, the Appellant argues that the Department of Health did not make those payments for the purpose of making residential units available to seniors.\n(e)Receipt or Expectation of Receipt: At or before the time of the self-supply, the Appellant must have reasonably expected to receive the government funding in respect of the Facility. The Appellant says that it expected to receive money from the Department of Health under the Service Agreement but that those payments were not in respect of the Facility.\n[25] As set out above, the dispute between the parties arises from the last three tests. The Appellant submits that none of these tests is met. It says that the purpose of giving seniors possession or use of a room in the Facility was to provide them with long-term health care services, not to provide them with a place of residence.\n[26] I will deal with these three tests separately.\nF. Government Funding [27] The Appellant\u2019s argument that there was no government funding is based on the distinction between single supplies and multiple supplies. The Appellant argues that it made a single supply of health care services which included an incidental supply of accommodation, not two different supplies - one of health care services and one of accommodation. Therefore, the Appellant argues that the payments it received from the Department of Health can only have been for health care services.\n[28] I disagree with the Appellant\u2019s argument for two reasons:\n(a)the supply in question is the self-supply under section 191, not the supply or supplies that the Appellant made following that self-supply; and\n(b)the definition of \u201cgovernment funding\u201d requires me to look at the purpose of the payment of an amount of money to the Appellant, not the purpose of the payment of all monies paid to the Appellant.\nThe Supply is the Self-Supply [29] As set out above, section 191.1 is not a stand-alone provision. It applies to determine the amount of GST\/HST collectible on a self-supply under section 191.\n[30] It does not matter what supplies the Appellant made to the Department of Health after the self-supply. Those supplies are not in issue. The only supply in issue is the self-supply of the Facility from the Appellant to itself.\n[31] The Appellant acknowledges this fact but argues that, to determine the purpose of the government funding, I must examine what the Department of Health was paying for. The Appellant argues that the Department of Health was paying for the supplies that the Appellant made after the self-supply and that I therefore have to examine those supplies in order to determine the purpose of the payments that the Appellant received. The Appellant says that, following the self-supply, the Appellant began making a single supply of health care services to the Department of Health and that its supply of accommodation was incidental to that supply.\n[32] Most of the Appellant\u2019s evidence at trial was devoted to proving that its supplies to the Department of Health were a single supply of health care services with an incidental supply of accommodation rather than multiple supplies.[5]\n[33] I do not have to determine whether, after the self-supply, the Appellant began making single supplies or multiple supplies to the Department of Health and I decline to do so. Even if the Appellant made a single supply of health care services after the self-supply, for the reasons set out below it would not change my conclusion that it received government funding.\nPayment of \u201can amount of money\" [34] As set out above, \u201cgovernment funding\u201d is defined to mean an amount of money paid or payable by a grantor to a builder of a residential complex for the purpose of making residential units in the complex available to seniors.\n[35] The Appellant argues that, because it made a single supply of health care services to the Department of Health, the purpose of the payments it received from the Department of Health can only have been to pay for health care services. This argument is based on an inaccurate reading of the definition of \u201cgovernment funding\u201d.\n[36] This same argument was made by the taxpayer in High-Crest. Justice Jorr\u00e9 rejected it. He concluded that the requirements of section 191.1 are met so long as part of the amounts received are for the purpose of making residential units available:[6]\nIt would not make sense to read [section 191.1] as not applying to government support simply because, there were, as is the case here, combined payments providing government support both for the provision of residential accommodation together with government support for additional services such as nursing services. Government support for residential accommodation is not diminished by the payment of additional amounts in support of other purposes.\n[footnotes omitted]\n[37] I agree with Justice Jorr\u00e9. The definition of \u201cgovernment funding\u201d refers to \u201can amount of money\u201d paid or payable to a builder. There is no need for me to examine the purpose of every payment that the Department of Health made. So long as some portion of the total payments that the Department of Health made to the Appellant were made for the purpose of making residential units in the Facility available to seniors, the test is met.\n[38] There is no question that at least some of the amounts that the Department of Health paid to the Appellant under the Service Agreement were made for that purpose. The very definition of \u201cservices\u201d in that agreement includes accommodation.[7]\n[39] In particular, certain payments under the Service Agreement cover all principle and interest on the mortgage that the Appellant used to finance the construction of the Facility. Thus, over the 25-year life of the Service Agreement, the Department of Health will pay the entire cost of building the Facility.\n[40] In addition, through annual payments called the capital renewal reserve, the Department of Health continues to pay for ongoing costs of maintaining the Facility such as replacing the roof.\n[41] In the circumstances, I have no trouble concluding that a portion of the money that the Department of Health paid to the Appellant was paid for the purpose of making the residential units in the Facility available to seniors and was therefore \u201cgovernment funding\u201d.\nG. In Respect of the Facility [42] As set out above, paragraph 191.1(2)(c) requires that, at or before the time of the self-supply, the Appellant must have reasonably expected to receive the government funding in respect of the Facility.\n[43] The Appellant argues that the funding was not in respect of the Facility. I do not see how funding that will ultimately cover the entire cost of constructing the Facility could not be said to be in respect of the Facility.\n[44] Having concluded that the Appellant received government funding in respect of the Facility, I have no difficulty in concluding that the test in paragraph 191.1(2)(c) is met. The Appellant signed the Service Agreement before construction began. Therefore, both at and before the time of the self-supply, the Appellant could reasonably expect to receive the government funding.\nH. Purpose of Occupancy as a Place of Residence [45] The Appellant also argues that the purpose test in paragraph 191.1(2)(b) is not met. The Appellant\u2019s argument relies on reading paragraph 191.1(2)(b) in isolation. Reading it within the context of subsection 191(3) shows the flaw in the Appellant\u2019s reasoning.\n[46] Paragraph 191.1(2)(b) requires that possession or use of at least 10% of the residential units in the Facility must have been intended to be given to the seniors \u201cfor the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence\u201d by the seniors. The Appellant says that use or possession of the residential units was given to the seniors for the purpose of receiving health care services, not for the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence. But if that is the case, then why was there a self-supply in the first place?\n[47] As set out above, for there to have been a self-supply, the rooms in the Facility have to have been \u201cresidential units\u201d. In other words, they have to have been rooms in a residence for seniors that had never been used or occupied but were intended to be used as a place of residence for individuals. Furthermore, to meet the requirements of subparagraph 191(3)(b)(i), possession or use of the rooms must have been given to a senior for the purpose of the occupancy of the unit by the senior as a place of residence. By agreeing that there was a self-supply, the Appellant necessarily agrees that both of these tests were met. How then can the Appellant claim that the test in paragraph 191.1(2)(b) is not met because possession or use of the rooms was not intended to be given for the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence by seniors?\n[48] The Appellant wants me to accept that the rooms were intended to be occupied as a place of residence for seniors and that possession or use of the rooms was given to seniors for the purpose of occupancy as a place of residence but, at the same time, that possession or use of the rooms was not intended to be given to the seniors for the purpose of their occupancy as a place of residence by the seniors. The absurdity of this position is self-evident.\n[49] There are two possibilities. Either:\n(a)the rooms were never intended to be occupied by a senior as a place of residence (because they were always intended to be incidental to a single supply of health care services) in which case the purpose tests in both subsection 191(3) and paragraph 191.1(2)(b) are not met and there was no self-supply and no entitlement to input tax credits;[8] or\n(b)the rooms were always intended to be occupied by a senior as a place of residence in which case the purpose tests in both subsection 191(3) and paragraph 191.1(2)(b) are met and there was both the entitlement to input tax credits that comes from carrying on the commercial activity of building the Facility and a self-supply where tax equal to those input tax credits was collected.\n[50] The Appellant is trying to have its cake and eat it too. When its entitlement to input tax credits is on the line, it wants to have built the Facility for seniors to occupy as a place of residence but when it comes to paying the corresponding tax, it wants to have built the Facility for the purpose of providing health care services. The Appellant cannot have it both ways.\nI. Conclusion [51] Based on all the foregoing, the appeals of the assessments of the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods ending between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 are dismissed.\n[52] Costs are awarded to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 5th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

That issue was not before me. The self-supply system as it is currently understood allows builders of long-term care homes to obtain input tax credits during construction. That presumably assists the builders with their cashflow during construction. I have no desire to introduce uncertainty to that well-established system. I have raised the point for the sole purpose of pointing out the fatal flaw in the Appellant\u2019s argument.\n",

Introduction\n[1] This is an appeal by MF Electric Incorporated (MF Electric or the Appellant) from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act, RSC, 1985, c 1 (5th Supp) (Act), for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 taxation years. In reassessing the Appellant, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) disallowed the deduction of professional, legal and accounting fees as well as management and administrative fees and imposed gross negligence penalties.\n[2] The Appellant carries on business as an electrical contractor. Richard MacInnis and Linda MacInnis are equal shareholders and directors of the Appellant and have been involved in the business since its inception in 1995. Douglas (or Doug) Rudolph was the Appellant\u2019s accountant for about 20 years from 1996 until 2016, when the Appellant faced an audit by the Minister.\n[3] In 2010, Doug Rudolph approached Richard and Linda MacInnis with a tax strategy (the IP Strategy) which he described as a strategy that would help grow their business by generating capital through tax savings. They trusted Mr. Rudolph and believed he was looking out for their best interests so they agreed to pursue the IP Strategy.\n[4] Essentially, the IP Strategy required that the MacInnises prepare biographies of their work and life experiences from childhood on. A value was then attached to their biographies and in computing its income, the Appellant deducted \u201cmanagement and administration fees\u201d (hereinafter referred to as \u201cmanagement fees\u201d) based on the value of its shareholders\u2019 biographies. The Appellant deducted management fees in the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years. In addition, the Appellant deducted professional, legal and accounting fees (hereinafter referred to as \u201cprofessional fees\u201d) paid for services related to the IP Strategy in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years.\nII. Issues [5] The issues in this appeal stem from the Appellant\u2019s involvement in the IP Strategy and the deduction of the related management fees. On reassessment, the Minister disallowed the deduction of those fees and imposed gross negligence penalties. The Appellant does not dispute that the management fees were not deductible expenses and does not appeal that decision. It does, however, appeal the imposition of the penalties. In addition, the Minister disallowed the deduction of professional fees paid for services related to the IP Strategy. The Appellant has appealed the denial of those expenses. Further, the reassessments for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years were made beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[6] The following table offers a snapshot of the amounts disallowed for the taxation years under appeal and the penalties imposed:\nTaxation year\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2015\nDisallowed professional fees\n$28,354\n$43,970\n$54,715\nDisallowed management fees\n$1,610,000\n$160,000\n$236,556\nPenalties assessed under 163(2)\n$127,400\n$8,800\n$13,010\n[7] The issues can be summarized as follows:\ni. Was the Minister justified in reassessing the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years?\nii. Was the Minister justified in imposing penalties for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years? and\niii. Was the Minister justified in disallowing the deduction of professional fees for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years?\nIII. The Parties\u2019 Positions\nThe Appellant\u2019s position\n[8] The Appellant\u2019s counsel described the Appellant as a victim of a master fraudster, Doug Rudolph, and added that the Appellant\u2019s shareholders had been twice victimized by Doug Rudolph. The Appellant acknowledged that it was accountable for the tax owing as a result of the inappropriate deduction of management fees and noted that it had paid the related amount of tax due. However, the Appellant submitted that it did not make misrepresentations attributable to wilful default but rather it got involved with the IP Strategy because of the relationship of abiding trust the MacInnises had built with Doug Rudolph. Nor did the Appellant make false statements in its returns under circumstances amounting to gross negligence or wilful blindness.\n[9] I think it is fair to say that, stripped to its bare essentials, the Appellant\u2019s position is that any false statements it made in filing its returns are attributable to Doug Rudolph with whom the MacInnises, described by counsel for the Appellant as unsophisticated, working-class, simple people, had built a long-term relationship of trust. Hence, the Minister was not justified in (i) reassessing beyond the normal assessment period; and (ii) nor was she justified in imposing gross negligence penalties.\n[10] With respect to the disallowed professional fees, the Appellant submitted they were deductible because, inter alia, there was a commercial activity being carried on and the Appellant believed it was paying these expenses for legitimate tax services. Further, the Appellant submitted that the expenses were reasonable, and not unusual, amounts for accounting services.\nThe Respondent\u2019s position\n[11] The Respondent argued that the Minister was justified in reassessing the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years because the Appellant made a misrepresentation and further that it was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Respondent submitted that the Appellant acknowledged it made a misrepresentation in its return for the 2010 taxation year by claiming a deduction for a management fee it never incurred. The Respondent also submitted that the Appellant made a misrepresentation in its returns for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years by claiming professional fees related to the IP Strategy. The Respondent argued that the Appellant had been careless or neglectful in making these misrepresentations and further that it was irrelevant that the Appellant\u2019s accountant prepared its returns.\n[12] With respect to the assessment of penalties, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant made a false statement in its returns for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years in claiming a deduction for management fees it did not incur. The Respondent submitted that the Appellant made a false statement under circumstances amounting to gross negligence and further, when examining the relevant factors, the Appellant was wilfully blind such that knowledge of the false statement can be imputed to the Appellant.\n[13] With respect to the deduction of professional fees, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not incur these fees to produce income from its electrical contracting business. Rather, the fees related to the IP Strategy and to invoices indicating they were tied to the tax avoided by the Appellant and its shareholders. Alternatively, the Respondent submitted the expenses were not reasonable in the circumstances.\nIV. Background Regarding the IP Strategy\n[14] The Appellant is a general electrical contractor doing mostly commercial work. In describing her role in the Appellant\u2019s business, Linda MacInnis stated that she was responsible for all the \u201coffice work\u201d, including managing invoices, filing and answering calls. She acknowledged she was the office manager and had good knowledge of the Appellant\u2019s income and expenses. She described Richard MacInnis\u2019 role as being responsible for preparing estimates and quotes and doing or supervising the electrical work when he was successful in securing jobs. Mr. MacInnis did not testify.\n[15] The MacInnises and Doug Rudolph all came from a small community where everyone knew each other and further, they knew him from having attended the same high school. The MacInnises hired Doug Rudolph in 1996 on the recommendation of their insurance agent and throughout the next 20 years, he was the Appellant\u2019s accountant to whom they entrusted the preparation of its income tax returns. Linda MacInnis used accounting software to keep the Appellant\u2019s books and at the end of each year, she handed a copy of the books over to Mr. Rudolph who would prepare the Appellant\u2019s returns and T4 information slips as well as the MacInnises\u2019 personal returns. In January of each year, the MacInnises met with Mr. Rudolph to review their returns. Linda MacInnis stated that Doug Rudolph explained their returns briefly without going into any great detail. She assumed he was preparing the Appellant\u2019s returns properly and felt supported in this belief by the fact that the Appellant had never been audited, until 2016.\n[16] In 2010, Doug Rudolph approached the MacInnises with a tax strategy he called an intellectual property strategy. He explained that the Appellant needed the MacInnises to grow such that they were worth something to the company; if he \u201cwent back and restructured\u201d their taxes, they could take advantage of tax savings. In putting the IP Strategy in place, Doug Rudolph was working with Rudy Terracina and what appeared to be his company, Agemo Corporation (Agemo).\n[17] Mr. Rudolph asked the MacInnises to prepare their biographies from birth to 2010 to \u201cassist in the re-filing\u201d and instructed them as follows (Exhibit A-6):\nCreate a biography for both you and Richard from date of birth to December 31st, 2010. Add as much detail about education, employment and any trips or vacations taken over that time \u2013 basically, anything that would have increased your personal value or expanded your personal horizons. Also, offer as much detail about the cost of anything for the timeframe referenced. All this assists in creating the value we will use;\n[18] Doug Rudolph told the MacInnises that their biographies comprised the \u201cintellectual property\u201d that had value for the Appellant and Mr. Terracina would assign a value to their biographies. Linda MacInnis testified that she did not really understand the IP Strategy but trusted Doug Rudolph. He would convey any requested information from the MacInnises to Rudy Terracina.\n[19] Linda MacInnis testified that she and Richard MacInnis found it difficult to prepare their biographies because they were not sure what they were supposed to do. The only biography entered into evidence was that of Richard MacInnis (Exhibit A-9). It is comprised of some handwritten notes indicating that Richard had been a boy scout, had taken swimming lessons, had built his own go-kart, had taken a hunter\u2019s safety course and provided information about various jobs he held over the years including summer jobs as a teenager and jobs working for electrical contractors before starting his own business.\n[20] On December 9, 2010, Linda MacInnis and Douglas Rudolph signed an engagement letter (Exhibit A-2) which provided as follows: \u201cI hereby engage Agemo to implement a tax avoidance strategy utilizing its proprietary knowledge to recover taxes paid corporately for the years 2003 through 2009\u201d; in addition, the engagement letter specified that the fee was \u201c30% of recovered taxes\u201d. Doug Rudolph followed up with an email on December 10, 2010, explaining that there was a calculation error and that the tax refund would be greater than originally thought. Linda MacInnis stated that she understood this meant that the Appellant would end up paying a higher amount to Agemo because they were providing a greater tax saving.\n[21] On April 1, 2011, Linda MacInnis emailed Doug Rudolph to inquire further about a warranty he had previously mentioned. In her email, Ms. MacInnis wrote as follows (Exhibit A-10; Transcript, Vol 1 at 140):\nRichard has mixed feelings again about doing this. You had mentioned that there is a guaranty that we can have if we pay a larger percentage (40%). We will go with the guaranty, can you send us a copy of the guaranty so that we can read it over?\n[22] On the same day, Mr. Rudolph responded by email and attached a copy of the warranty which reads, in part, as follows (Exhibit A-8; Transcript, Vol 1 at 141):\nIn the event of any reassessment which results in tax owing arriving (sic) from the participation in the Partners in Research Joint Venture, the taxes owing will be paid by Partners in Research.\n[23] Mr. Rudolph provided no information about \u201cPartners in Research\u201d. Nonetheless, Linda MacInnis testified that they took the warranty so that if any concerns came up, in the context of an audit or otherwise, Doug Rudolph would take care of it. The warranty gave her comfort and she acknowledged that if anything went wrong, the worse that would happen would be that the warranty would cover the taxes resulting from the disallowed expenses. By adding the warranty, the Appellant was required to pay an additional 10% of any tax savings for a total fee of 40% of tax savings resulting from the IP Strategy.\n[24] The Appellant entered into evidence several quotes from Doctor Tax regarding the fees to be paid for the IP Strategy (Exhibits A-12, A-14, A-16 and A-18) as well as some bank drafts for amounts paid to Doctor Tax (Exhibits A-11 and A-15). Linda MacInnis testified that she treated the quotes as invoices and paid the amounts to Doctor Tax immediately. It is difficult to reconcile the quotes from Doctor Tax with the payments made by the Appellant and the professional fees deducted and disallowed and the Appellant did not attempt any reconciliation at the hearing. It is sufficient to note the following information regarding the quotes:\none quote refers to Estimated refunds for 2007, 2008 and 2009;\none quote refers to Estimated T1 Avoided Tax \u2013 2011;\none quote refers to T1 Avoided Tax \u2013 2011 and T2 Avoided Tax \u2013 2011; and\none quote refers to Estimated benefit (T1) \u2013 2012 and Estimated Benefit (T2) \u2013 2012.\n[25] In 2016, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) officers from the Criminal Investigations Program met with the MacInnises to ask questions about their involvement with Doug Rudolph and the IP Strategy. Linda MacInnis testified that the CRA officers concluded there was no criminal wrongdoing. Shortly thereafter, the Appellant was the subject of an audit which led to the reassessments that are the subject of this appeal. At the time of the audit, the MacInnises hired counsel and a new accountant, Earl MacLeod, to review the Appellant\u2019s returns and advise them going forward. They all met with the auditor, Ryan Sampson. I note that Mr. Sampson testified that he conducted his audit without accessing the criminal investigation file. Mr. Sampson did not reach out to Rudy Terracina as it appears he had passed away by then but he did reach out to Doug Rudolph who referred him to his counsel. Counsel did not return Mr. Sampson\u2019s call to their office.\n[26] During his testimony, Mr. MacLeod stated that he advised the MacInnises and MF Electric that they should repay the amounts that were refunded as a result of the deduction of the management fees because he did not find their deductibility could be justified. The MacInnises acknowledged that the management fees were not properly deductible and on the advice of Mr. MacLeod and based on his calculations, the Appellant paid an amount over $400,000. However, as mentioned earlier, the Appellant is disputing the denial of the deductibility of the professional fees and the imposition of the penalties.\n[27] As part of the context of this appeal, it is relevant to mention that in 2006, the MacInnises had personally invested $25,000 through Doug Rudolph. Linda MacInnis testified that Doug told her and Richard that they would be investing in in a bridge loan with CanGlobe. It was to be a one-year investment with a 25% return \u2013 but that never materialized. Doug told the MacInnises that there were problems with the banks overseas and kept promising they would get their money. They never did. In December 2010, the MacInnises were summoned to attend at an examination before the Nova Scotia Securities Commission regarding an investigation involving Douglas Rudolph and the CanGlobe investments (Exhibit R-1). Linda MacInnis testified that they defended Doug because when they asked him about the Securities Commission investigation, he told them it was all a misunderstanding, he was the subject of false accusations and they would get their money.\n[28] The Appellant called David Worrell, a retired police detective, to testify about his involvement with Doug Rudolph. In summarizing his testimony, it suffices to state that Mr. Worrell serves as an example of another person who participated in the CanGlobe bridge loan scheme. I would add that, on the recommendation of Mr. Rudolph, he also made donations to the Global Learning Gifting Initiative in 2006 and 2007 and received a tax receipt for five times the amount donated. He testified that he found Mr. Rudolph to be very persuasive and appeared to be knowledgeable, \u201cplus it was a very attractive return on the money\u201d (Transcript, Vol 3 at 23). The fact that Mr. Worrell was persuaded to invest in CanGlobe, as many others were, does not assist the Appellant with respect to the separate issues raised in this appeal in relation to its participation in the IP Strategy.\nV. Analysis\nReassessment beyond the normal assessment period\n[29] In addressing the first issue in this appeal, the Court must determine whether the Minister was justified in reassessing the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years.\n[30] Subsection 152(4) of the Act sets out the Minister\u2019s right to assess beyond the normal reassessment period determined under subsection 152(3.1). More specifically relevant to this appeal, subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) provides as follows:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n152 (4) Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie ou donner avis par \u00e9crit qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 toute personne qui a produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants :\na) le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration :\n(i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\n[31] The wording of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) is such that it is sufficient for the Minister to establish neglect or carelessness without having to consider whether there was wilful default or fraud (see Deyab v Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at paras 58-61 [Deyab]). Having said this, the burden is on the Minister to establish both that the taxpayer or the person filing the return has made a misrepresentation and that it is attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud (see Vine v R, 2015 FCA 125 at paras 23-24).\n[32] The Minister\u2019s burden is to establish that there has been a misrepresentation at the time the return is filed. In commenting on the issue of timing in Nesbitt v Canada, 96 DTC 6588 at para 8, the Federal Court of Appeal expressed its view of the purpose of subsection 152(4) as follows:\nIt appears to me that one purpose of subsection 152(4) is to promote careful and accurate completion of income tax returns. Whether or not there is misrepresentation through neglect or carelessness in the completion of a return is determinable at the time the return is filed. A misrepresentation has occurred if there is an incorrect statement on the return form, at least one that is material to the purposes of the return and to any future reassessment. It remains a misrepresentation even if the Minister could or does, by a careful analysis of the supporting material, perceive the error on the return form. It would undermine the self-reporting nature of the tax system if taxpayers could be careless in the completion of returns while providing accurate basic data in working papers, on the chance that the Minister would not find the error but, if he did within four years, the worst consequence would be a correct reassessment at that time.\n[Underlining added]\n[33] Courts have consistently held that the threshold for establishing misrepresentation is low. In support of this view, in Francis & Associates v R, 2014 TCC 137 at para 20, Justice Bocock wrote as follows:\nA misrepresentation is any statement that is \u201cincorrect.\u201d: Minister of National Revenue v. Foot, [1964] C.T.C. 317 (Can. Ex. Ct.). Also, several cases have indicated that \u201cany\u201d error made in a return filed is tantamount to a misrepresentation, Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, [1961] C.T.C. 211 (Can. Ex. Ct.), Nesbitt v. R., and Ridge Run Developments Inc. v. R., [2007] 3 C.T.C. 2605 (T.C.C. [General Procedure]). Therefore, the threshold to establish a misrepresentation is low.\n[34] In filing its return for 2010, the Appellant deducted management fees of $1,622,000 (Exhibit A-5), $1,610,000 of which related to the IP Strategy. Linda MacInnis testified that she did not recall reviewing the return in detail but stated that Mr. Rudolph would have shown her the Appellant\u2019s balance sheet. When asked about the Appellant\u2019s financial statements for 2010 (Exhibit A-4), Linda MacInnis stated that she did not understand the specifics but she understood that the 2010 current liabilities were significantly larger than those for 2009 due to the deductions related to the IP strategy. Ms. MacInnis may not have understood the intricacies of the IP Strategy but as the office manager and bookkeeper, she knew that the Appellant had not incurred or paid any management fees in relation to the IP Strategy. In addition, the Appellant acknowledges that it was incorrect to deduct the management fees related to the IP strategy and, on the advice of its current accountant, has now paid over $400,000 to cover all or part of the taxes owed in relation to the inappropriate deduction. Hence, the Appellant, through its director and office manager, knew that it was deducting an expense it did not incur and made no inquiries to confirm the appropriateness of the deduction.\n[35] The Appellant did not deduct any management fees related to the IP Strategy in 2011 and 2012 but it did deduct professional fees related to the IP Strategy. As discussed earlier, the Appellant was required to pay 30% of the tax savings resulting from the IP Strategy. Ms. MacInnis received quotes relating to these fees and, treating them as invoices, paid them quickly. As described earlier, some of the quotes from Doctor Tax referred to tax avoided and further, to tax avoided relating to both a T1 and a T2. Courts have found that \u201cwhere a taxpayer thoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assesses the situation and files on what he believes bona fide to be the proper method there can be no misrepresentation as contemplated by section 152\u201d (see Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd v R [1991] F.C.J. No 52 (FCA) at para 7 [Regina Shoppers]). I find that the Appellant and its directors did not \u2018thoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assess the situation\u2019 before filing the Appellant\u2019s returns; they were content to rely on the trust they had in Mr. Rudolph. I would add that by then, the MacInnises had already been summoned to testify before the Nova Scotia Securities Commission regarding an investigation of Douglas Rudolph.\n[36] To borrow the words of Justice Muldoon in Reilly v R, [1984] CTC 21 at para 51 (FCTD), \u201cwisdom is not infallibility and prudence is not perfection\u201d. However, in the present case, the Appellant has fallen far short of exercising reasonable care (see Venne v R, [1984] FCJ No 314 (FCTD) at para 16). In Regina Shoppers, supra at para 7, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed that it had been established \u201cthat the care that must be exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct\u201d. At the hearing, Linda MacInnis repeatedly stated that the Appellant simply trusted Doug Rudolph and consequently, no questions were asked, no further inquiries were made. The Appellant cannot shield itself from the consequences of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) by shifting the blame to Doug Rudolph (see for example Snowball v R, [1996] T.C.J. No. 276 at para 18).\n[37] In light of the above, I find that the Appellant made a misrepresentation in filing its returns for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years and that it was attributable to neglect or carelessness. Hence, the Minister has met the burden to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years.\nPenalties pursuant to subsection 163(2)\n[38] In addressing the second issue in this appeal, the Court must determine whether the Minister was justified in imposing penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act with regards to the claim for management expenses made in the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years. No penalties were assessed in relation to the amounts deducted as professional fees.\n[39] Subsection 163(2) reads as follows:\n(2) Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty of the greater of $100 and 50% of the total of\u2026\n(2) Toute personne qui, sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans une d\u00e9claration, un formulaire, un certificat, un \u00e9tat ou une r\u00e9ponse (appel\u00e9 \u00ab d\u00e9claration \u00bb au pr\u00e9sent article) rempli, produit ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, selon le cas, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou y participe, y consent ou y acquiesce est passible d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e9gale, sans \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 $, \u00e0 50 % du total des montants suivants\u2026\n[40] Hence, the Minister must show that the Appellant made, or participated in, or assented to, or acquiesced in, the making of a false statement and did so knowingly or did so under circumstances amounting to gross negligence. As provided by subsection 163(3), the Minister bears the burden of establishing the facts that justify the assessment of the penalty.\n[41] In claiming a deduction for management fees it never incurred, the Appellant made a false statement. It is worth reiterating that the Appellant has acknowledged that the management fees were not deductible. Thus the first element of subsection 163(2),that of making a false statement, has been established. In the circumstances, the more pressing question is whether the Appellant made the false statement \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cunder circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d.\n[42] Since the seminal case in Venne, supra, courts have consistently held that \u201cgross negligence\u201d requires greater neglect than simply failing to exercise reasonable care, which might otherwise be sufficient for the application of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) discussed earlier. In Venne, supra at para 37, the Federal Court stated that gross negligence \u201cmust involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, an indifference as to whether the law is complied with or not\u201d. This was found to mean \u201cakin to burying one\u2019s head in the sand\u201d (see Guindon v Canada, 2015 SCC 41 at para 60). A considerable body of case law has developed over the years since the decision was rendered in Venne in 1984, unsurprisingly, in light of the importance of the findings of fact regarding a taxpayer\u2019s role in the making of a false statement in each appeal. The parties referred to many of those cases at the hearing of this appeal. It is not necessary, nor useful, to discuss them all and I will not do so.\n[43] In Wynter v Canada, 2017 FCA 195 [Wynter], the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that the Minister could meet its burden of showing that the false statement was made knowingly by demonstrating that the taxpayer was wilfully blind such that knowledge could be imputed to the taxpayer. In distinguishing between wilful blindness and gross negligence, the Court stated as follows (at para 13):\nA taxpayer is wilfully blind in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for an inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth. The concept is one of deliberate ignorance: R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13 at paras. 23-24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411 (Briscoe); Sansregret at para. 24. In these circumstances, the doctrine of wilful blindness imputes knowledge to a taxpayer: Briscoe at para. 21.\n[44] While gross negligence is determined by an objective assessment, wilful blindness requires a subjective assessment of the comportment of the taxpayer (seeWynter at para 12). I want to make it clear that counsel for the Appellant was correct when he asserted that wilful blindness was to be appreciated from a subjective point of view.\n[45] In addition, the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that gross negligence, which is distinct from wilful blindness, \u201carises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what could be expected of a reasonable taxpayer. Simply put, if the wilfully blind taxpayer knew better, the grossly negligent taxpayer ought to have known better\u201d [Wynter, supra at para 18].\n[46] I turn now to the question of whether the Appellant had actual or subjective knowledge that it made false statements in its returns. Linda MacInnis testified that when Doug Rudolph attended the Appellant\u2019s office to finalize its returns, she did not review them in any great detail (see for example, Transcript, Vol 1 at 20 and 121). Ms. MacInnis added that she did not have an accounting background and did not feel she needed to go through the returns in detail because she assumed Mr. Rudolph was completing their returns properly. Although I believe Ms. MacInnis when she states she did not understand the tax implications of the IP Strategy, this provides no exoneration to the Appellant (see Tomlinson v R, 2016 TCC 246 at para 19). The relevant question becomes whether the Appellant was wilfully blind in the making of a false statement.\n[47] I find the remarks of Justice Owen, in Peck v R, 2018 TCC 52 at paras 50 and 51 instructive regarding the relevance of a taxpayer\u2019s personal attributes. He wrote as follows:\n[50] The subjective nature of the wilful blindness standard also means that the personal attributes of the individual may be considered in determining whether the individual is wilfully blind.\n[51] In contrast, the objective nature of the gross negligence standard means that the personal attributes of the individual are not relevant unless the individual establishes that he or she is incapable of understanding the risk the individual has failed to avoid (see R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49 at paragraph 40).\n[48] In cases dealing with penalties assessed under subsection 163(2), and although not an exhaustive list, the courts have considered the following personal attributes and particular circumstances to be relevant: education, intelligence, knowledge and experience of the taxpayer; the magnitude of the advantage or omission; the opportunity to detect the false statement; the explanations provided by a tax preparer (see for example Torres v R, 2013 TCC 380, conf. Strachan v Canada, 2015 FCA 60).\n[49] In determining whether the Appellant was wilfully blind in making false statements in its returns, we must look at the conduct of its principals who were making decisions on its behalf. Counsel for the Appellant presented the MacInnises as unsophisticated, simple people, even referring to them as working-class schlumps, who lacked the education to know or understand what was happening. I do not agree.\n[50] Ms. MacInnis finished high school, held a number of jobs including working for a temporary agency doing office work, as well as working for a collection agency and the Dartmouth Free Press. More importantly, Ms. MacInnis was the Appellant\u2019s bookkeeper; she prepared invoices, received and paid the business\u2019s bills, managed the employees\u2019 time sheets, paid their salaries and ensured they received their T4 slips. She admitted she had \u201cgood knowledge\u201d of the Appellant\u2019s income and expenses.\n[51] Although Richard MacInnis did not testify, I accept Linda MacInnis\u2019 description of his education and involvement in the Appellant\u2019s business. Richard completed a 2-year college program to train as an electrician and went back to school each year for four years to attend a 7-week course to become a journeyman. He worked for small electrical companies for a few years and at Seaboard Electric for 8 or 9 years. In the Appellant\u2019s business, he was responsible for preparing estimates and quotes and doing or supervising the electrical work when he was successful in securing jobs.\n[52] I accept that the MacInnises did not have any sophisticated tax knowledge. Nevertheless, they were intelligent people running a successful business, in an industry where safety is of utmost importance, earning income well over a million dollars and actually, at times, over 1.5 million dollars during the relevant taxation years.\n[53] The Appellant deducted management fees in the amounts of $1,610,000, $160,000 and $236,556 in the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years respectively. For the Appellant\u2019s 2010 taxation year, the amount is of such magnitude that it created a loss of more than one million dollars. By 2010, the Appellant had been in business for 15 years and had never reported a loss (Transcript, Vol 1 at 125). Linda MacInnis testified that she would have had invoices or receipts for the expenses listed in Schedule 125 of the T2 return for 2010 and she would have paid the expenses on behalf of the Appellant. She had no such invoice for the management fees. She acknowledged that the only support for the management fees in the amount of $1,610,000 was the shareholders\u2019 biographies and the IP Strategy. Linda MacInnis testified that she never saw any calculations showing how the value of the shareholders\u2019 biographies was established. Although the amounts deducted in the 2013 and 2015 taxation years are much lower than that in 2010, they are significant amounts representing more than half the total operating expenses claimed.\n[54] All returns for the taxation years in which the Appellant deducted the management fees were filed after the MacInnises had been summoned to appear before the Nova Securities Commission in an investigation of Douglas Rudolph. In addition, by the time the Appellant filed its returns for the 2013 and 2015 taxation years, they had attended a meeting with their friend and competitor, Tim Jones, at the office of his accountant Boyd Hunter. Doug Rudolph was also in attendance at this meeting which took place in August 2011. In his testimony, Mr. Hunter stated that he was not impressed with the idea pitched by Doug Rudolph; in his view, it did not pass the smell test. He was adamant that he would not have told the Appellant that the proposed strategy was a good idea. Mr. Hunter could not remember what he said at the meeting but was quite certain that, after the meeting, he would have told Tim Jones that he did not recommend pursuing the concept (Transcript, Vol 3 at 38). He testified that he would have told Tim Jones, \u201cBut if you want, I can still ask them for some actual case references, and et cetera, and it will be up to you whether you want me to actually spend time on that if they send it back to us\u201d (Transcript, Vol 3 at 40).\n[55] On the same day of the meeting that took place in August 2011, Mr. Hunter sent an email to Doug Rudolph asking him to provide case law in support of the IP Strategy. Doug Rudolph responded to the email including the Appellant and Tim Jones in the reply but excluded Mr. Hunter. Doug Rudolph did not provide any support for the IP Strategy, writing only that he had forwarded the message to head office and adding that \u201cCRA will often harass all the way to Court, but will settle before Court as they do not want to lose nor do they want to set precedent\u201d (Exhibit R-2). Mr. Jones changed accountants at one point and in early 2014, he exchanged emails with Doug Rudolph about the IP Strategy. However, when Tim Jones saw an article published in the Chronicle Herald reporting on an RCMP investigation resulting in charges laid against Doug Rudolph (see Exhibit R-3), he emailed Doug Rudolph thinking the article was about someone else with the same name. After Mr. Rudolph confirmed it was about him, Tim Jones stated that he \u201cwas done\u201d at that point and no amount of explaining or justifying by Mr. Rudolph would have changed that. Mr. Jones testified that he would have communicated this information to the Appellant.\n[56] I note that the Appellant did not deduct management fees in its return for the 2014 taxation year, but it did so again in the 2015 taxation year, after the article appeared in the Chronicle Herald and after Tim Jones would have communicated with the MacInnises about this.\n[57] Having reviewed the MacInnises\u2019 personal attributes and the particular circumstances in which the Appellant made false statements, I find that the Appellant was wilfully blind in deducting management fees without having incurred the fees and without inquiring further about any clear basis for how those amounts were established. At no point did the Appellant, through the MacInnises, see the red flags indicating a need for further inquiry from Doug Rudolph or even from Rudy Terracina who was the one to attach a value to the shareholders\u2019 biographies for the purposes of the IP Strategy. Linda MacInnis repeatedly stated that they trusted Doug Rudolph and did not ask any questions.\n[58] To borrow the words of the Federal Court of Appeal in Wynter, the Appellant, through the MacInnises, deliberately chose not to make inquiries in order to avoid what might be such an inconvenient truth. In spite of Mr. MacInnis\u2019 mixed feelings about the IP Strategy, the Appellant chose to purchase a warranty, which in my view connotes a process of suppressing a suspicion (see Wynter at para 17). In my view, this is sufficient to establish wilful blindness such that knowledge can be imputed to the Appellant. Hence, based on the teachings of the Federal Court of Appeal in Wynter, the Minister has met its burden of establishing the knowledge requirement under subsection 163(2) for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years.\n[59] As mentioned earlier, gross negligence, which is separate from wilful blindness, arises when a taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what could be expected of a reasonable taxpayer. In my view, the findings above regarding wilful blindness also support a finding that the Appellant\u2019s conduct represents a marked departure from what could be expected of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. A reasonable person in the circumstances of the Appellant and its shareholders would have made inquiries from an independent person about the IP strategy and the nonsensical explanations provided by Doug Rudolph. A reasonable person would have been suspicious of the huge value assigned to their biographies and of Rudy Terracina who was evaluating their biographies without providing any basis for his calculations. A reasonable person would have been suspicious of the extraordinary tax result, the huge loss that resulted from the deduction of the management fees. A reasonable person would have sought independent accounting advice about these extraordinary tax advantages. A reasonable person would have made further inquiries about the quotes and invoices and the entities to whom they were making payments. A reasonable person would have made further inquiries after being approached by the Nova Scotia Securities Commission and finding out that Doug Rudolph was being investigated.\n[60] In my view, the conduct of the Appellant in these circumstances represented a marked departure from the conduct one would expect from a reasonable person placed in the same circumstances. Like the taxpayer in Peck, supra, the Appellant cannot simply throw its hands up and say that it, through the MacInnises, blindly relied on their accountant, without making any attempt at seeking a better understanding of the IP Strategy and without making any effort to verify the accuracy and justifiability of the deduction claimed. All, in spite of the many red flags referred to above (see for example Peck, supra at para 79).\n[61] For these reasons, I find that the Minister has established that the Appellant was wilfully blind in making false statements in its returns for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years and did so under circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\nThe deductibility of the professional fees\n[62] The third issue raised in this appeal concerns the deductibility of the professional fees the Appellant claimed in its returns for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years. In addressing this question, the Court must determine whether the expenses meet the criteria for deducting business expenses.\n[63] I do not dispute the Appellant\u2019s assertion that the Appellant is an operating electrical business that has been in existence for almost 30 years at this stage, a legitimate, established business, and not a fly-by-night operation. However, in my view, that is not determinative of whether a particular expense is deductible. Rather, the question is whether the expenses were incurred for the purpose of earning income from the Appellant\u2019s business without which the deductibility of the expenses is prohibited pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act.\n[64] As mentioned earlier, the Appellant paid fees based on quotes it received from Doctor Tax, quotes referencing tax avoided for T1 and T2s. We know that the amounts were based on 30% of what was established to be tax avoided and that they were related to the IP Strategy. There is no other information about what services were actually provided to the Appellant. In addition, in light of the reference to T1 avoided tax, I would add that there is no information about which proportion of the expenses relates to tax savings for the MacInnises\u2019 personally. Clearly, any amounts paid in relation to the MacInnises\u2019 personal returns are not properly deductible by the corporate Appellant. I would also note that Linda MacInnis testified that Doug Rudolph never charged her for preparing her personal returns (Transcript, Vol 1 at 162).\n[65] The Appellant\u2019s counsel described the \u201cservice\u201d for which the Appellant paid professional fees as \u201cthe service of pursuing the tax \u2013 the IP Strategy regarding management fees\u201d (Transcript, Vol 3 at 159). In arguing in support of the deductibility of the professional fees, the Appellant relied on cases involving the issue of whether a business was actually being carried on (such as Hammill v Canada, 2005 FCA 252) or whether there was a source of income (such as Johnson v Canada, 2012 FCA 253, application for leave to appeal to the SCC dismissed, no 35090). I do not find that these cases support the Appellant\u2019s argument that the professional fees deducted by the Appellant meet the legislative criteria for deductibility.\n[66] I find that the professional fees paid by the Appellant were not expenses incurred for the purpose of earning income from the activities of the electrical business of the Appellant. Those fees were not incurred for business purposes. The Appellant could not explain clearly to the Court what those expenses were for, how the amounts were established and who exactly they were paid to. Documentary evidence showed that the Appellant paid amounts to Doctor Tax (see for example, a bank draft, Exhibit A-11) and to a numbered company (see accounting entry, Exhibit A-16). Linda MacInnis believed that the numbered company was Doug Rudolph\u2019s corporation and she was unclear on whether Doctor Tax was linked to Doug Rudolph or to Agemo\/Rudy Terracina (see for example Transcript, Vol 1 at 59). The professional fees do not meet the legislative criteria for the deductibility of business expenses.\nVI. Conclusion [67] For all the above reasons, I conclude that the Minister was justified:\nin reassessing the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2010, 2011, 2012 taxation years;\nin imposing gross negligence penalties on amounts related to the management fees for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 taxation years; and\nin disallowing the deduction of professional fees for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 taxation years.\n[68] The appeal for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 taxation years is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 9th day of May 2023.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 60\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-1177(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMF ELECTRIC INCORPORATED AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\nDATE OF HEARING:\nNovember 21, 22, 23, 24, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Gabrielle St-Hilaire\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nMay 9, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nDerek B.

INTRODUCTION [1] This is an appeal by Mr. Kevin Lee Hachulla (\u201cMr. Hachulla\u201d) from a determination made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) on February 6, 2020, under the Employment Insurance Act [1] and the Canada Pension Plan.[2] The Minister determined that Ben Robertson (\u201cMr. Robertson\u201d) was employed by Creative Concepts Landscaping (\u201cCreative Concepts\u201d) in insurable and pensionable employment from April 5, 2019 to September 3, 2019 (the \u201cPeriod\u201d) under paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA and paragraph 6(1)(a) of the CPP.\n[2] Mr. Hachulla testified at trial. The Respondent called Mr. Robertson.\nII. THE ISSUES [3] The issues in this appeal are as follows:\n-Whether Mr. Robertson was, during the Period, engaged in insurable employment with Creative Concepts under paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA.\n-Whether Mr. Robertson was, during the Period, engaged in pensionable employment with Creative Concepts under paragraph 6(1)(a) of the CPP.\n[4] To answer these questions, the Court must determine whether Mr. Robertson was, during the Period, employed by Creative Concepts under an express or implied contract of service, written or oral.\nIII. THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS [5] The relevant provision of the EIA read as follows:\n5. (1) Subject to subsection (2), insurable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise;\n[6] The relevant provisions of the CPP read as follows\n2. (1) In this Act,\n\u201cemployment\u201d means the state of being employed under an express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, and includes the tenure of an office;\n\u2026\n6. (1) Pensionable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada that is not excepted employment;\nIV. THE FACTS A. Context\n[7] During the Period, Mr. Robertson provided landscaping and hardscaping services to Creative Concepts.\n[8] On September 3, 2019, Mr. Robertson stopped providing services to Creative Concepts after he injured himself.\n[9] On September 26, 2019, Mr. Robertson filed an application for Employment Insurance benefits with Service Canada. Service Canada requested a ruling from the Canada Pension Plan\/Employment Insurance Rulings Division of the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) in order to determine his employment status during the Period.\n[10] On November 14, 2019, the CRA notified Mr. Hachulla, Mr. Robertson, and Service Canada it had determined that during the Period, Mr. Robertson had been an employee of Creative Concepts engaged in insurable and pensionable employment under the EIA and the CPP.\n[11] Mr. Hachulla disagreed with the CRA\u2019s determination and filed an appeal to the Minister.\n[12] On February 6, 2020, the Minister confirmed the CRA\u2019s determination and notified Mr. Hachulla, Mr. Robertson, and Service Canada thereof.\nB. Mr. Hachulla\u2019s Testimony [13] Mr. Hachulla is the owner and operator of Creative Concepts. Creative Concepts provides landscaping and hardscaping services.\n[14] According to Mr. Hachulla, during the Period, Creative Concepts hired subcontractors to work on landscaping and hardscaping projects. During the Period, he was often looking for subcontractors, who were difficult to find. He told the Court that his subcontractors frequently stop working without warning because they decide to no longer provide landscaping and hardscaping services or because they can obtain more money elsewhere.\n[15] Creative Concepts was financially liable if a project was not completed in the time agreed upon with clients. Creative Concepts was also liable for the quality of the work done by its subcontractors.\n[16] Mr. Hachulla required that each new worker of its subcontractors be entitled to work in Canada. He stated that on a new worker\u2019s first day, he verified whether the worker had a Canadian social insurance number. He also required that he be notified when a subcontractor had new workers on a project site.\n[17] Creative Concepts paid its subcontractors an hourly rate for their services. Before the beginning of the Period, Creative Concepts had paid its subcontractors on a project basis, but Mr. Hachulla realized that this was not a financially sound way of proceeding. According to Mr. Hachulla, when subcontractors were paid on a project basis, the completed work often had quality issues because it was done too fast, so much so that in some cases, the work had to be redone at Creative Concepts\u2019 expense.\n[18] In order to ensure that Creative Concepts would make a profit on every project, Mr. Hachulla would meet with the subcontractor before the beginning of each project to tell them his budget for the work that had to be done. Taking the budget into consideration, Mr. Hachulla and the subcontractor would agree on an acceptable number of hours within which to complete the project. The subcontractor was paid for that number of hours.\n[19] Creative Concepts provided the tools used by its subcontractors to perform their services. These tools included a pick-up truck, gardening tools, sledgehammers, shovels, rakes, wheelbarrows, compactors, chop saws, and small machinery or heavy machinery, depending on the project.\n[20] Mr. Hachulla scheduled the date and time that the subcontractors began working on projects. He expected the subcontractors to pick up the tools to perform their services at Creative Concepts\u2019 office around 7:30 a.m. and begin working on the project site between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. He testified that ideally, he would have liked them to be on a project site for 8 to 10 hours a day. He wanted them to start between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and finish at approximately 6:00 p.m. because of the noise levels associated with that type of work. Unfortunately, the workers did not always follow this schedule because they often decided to sleep in or because they had \u201cside jobs\u201d for other clients. Mr. Hachulla did not address the situation because he believed the workers were subcontractors, not employees, and he was unable to fire the subcontractors for not beginning their work at a certain time.\n[21] Mr. Hachulla expected the subcontractors to notify him by text message when they could not start working on a project at 8:30 a.m. or if they were unable to work on a project on a specific day. However, Mr. Hachulla stated that he was not always notified. When he was not notified, Mr. Hachulla did not penalize the subcontractors because he believed they were subcontractors, not employees.\n[22] During the Period, Mr. Robertson was one of Creative Concepts\u2019 main subcontractors and was required to provide services every day.\n[23] At the beginning of September 2019, Mr. Hachulla received a text message from Mr. Robertson saying that he had fallen down a set of stairs and that he had injured his knee. In the same text message, Mr. Robertson then told him that he could no longer work because of this injury.\nC. Mr. Robertson\u2019s Testimony\n[24] Mr. Robertson is an experienced installer of paving stones. He testified that he has worked as an installer all his life. A few years prior to the Period, he had done some landscaping work for Mr. Hachulla as a subcontractor. At that time, he had his own landscaping business, which was called Viper Paving Stones.\n[25] At the beginning of 2019, Mr. Robertson ran into Mr. Hachulla in a store. Mr. Hachulla asked Mr. Robertson if he wanted to work as a subcontractor for Creative Concepts. At trial, Mr. Robertson stated that he had worked for Mr. Hachulla in the past and described Mr. Hachulla as a \u201cgreat guy\u201d. Since Mr. Robertson was looking for work and had liked working for Mr. Hachulla in the past, he accepted the offer.\n[26] Mr. Robertson agreed to be paid a rate of $25 per hour and to invoice Creative Concepts for his services.\n[27] During the Period, Mr. Robertson was paid by cheque made to his name. He was paid after having invoiced Creative Concepts, but he did not use a business name on the invoices; Mr. Robertson\u2019s invoices only mentioned the amounts payable and the names of the projects that he had worked on. The invoices also did not include a business number or an amount payable for GST. The invoices that Mr. Robertson had provided to Creative Concepts for work done before the Period did include this information. At that time, Mr. Robertson used his pick-up truck and his tools to provide his services to Creative Concepts.\n[28] Mr. Robertson was not paid vacation time. He stated that he did not ask Mr. Hachulla to be paid vacation time because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make waves\u201d. He added that \u201c[w]hen you\u2019ve got five kids to feed and you\u2019re battling stuff, it\u2019s an easier situation to work in sometimes you make sacrifices, you don\u2019t question stuff you just work.\u201d\n[29] During the Period, Mr. Robertson only worked for Creative Concepts. Mr. Robertson was required to begin working on a project at approximately 8:45 a.m. He stated that he did so most days.\n[30] Creative Concepts provided Mr. Robertson with the tools and equipment that he needed to provide his services. In general, these tools included a pick-up truck, sledgehammers, shovels, rakes, wheelbarrows, compactors, and a chop saw. Sometimes, but not often, Mr. Robertson chose to use his own tools. He did not do so on a regular basis, although he did use his own regular skill saw a few times because he liked it better than the one provided by Creative Concepts.\n[31] Mr. Robertson used a Creative Concepts truck (\u201cTruck\u201d) to go to the worksite. Mr. Hachulla let him use the Truck to travel between Mr. Robertson\u2019s home and the worksite because Mr. Robertson did not have a vehicle during the Period. Consequently, Mr. Robertson would sometimes keep the Truck overnight so that he could use it to drive to the worksite the next morning.\n[32] Mr. Robertson purchased some of the material used for projects for Mr. Hachulla. He used the Truck to transport materials to the worksite. Mr. Hachulla reimbursed Mr. Robertson for any materials that he purchased for projects and for the fuel used while driving the Truck.\n[33] Mr. Robertson could hire a subcontractor to work on Creative Concepts projects, but Mr. Hachulla needed to be informed because he was liable for the workers\u2019 safety. Mr. Hachulla did not care whom his workers brought as subcontractors as long as they could legally work in Canada.\n[34] Mr. Robertson brought his wife to work on a Creative Concepts project two or three times during the Period. She was the only person whom he asked to work on a Creative Concepts project. Mr. Robertson\u2019s wife was paid an hourly wage. Before she started working on a Creative Concepts project, Mr. Robertson asked for Mr. Hachulla\u2019s authorization. He also asked Mr. Hachulla if he would agree to pay for Ms. Robertson\u2019s services in addition to what they had agreed that Mr. Robertson was going to be paid. Mr. Hachulla agreed and recorded the hours that Ms. Robertson worked in a book that he normally used for that purpose. The cost of Ms. Robertson\u2019s services was included in Mr. Robertson\u2019s invoices.\n[35] The majority of the time, Mr. Hachulla was on project worksites with Mr. Robertson. When he was not on other project sites, he was seeing clients in order to obtain payment.\n[36] According to Mr. Robertson, there was no set deadline. A worker would go to the worksite and complete every job as fast as possible.\n[37] Mr. Hachulla would tell Mr. Robertson what had to be done on a specific day and Mr. Robertson would then do it.\n[38] Mr. Robertson stated that his work schedule varied, every day. He indicated that there was no set number of work hours. Most of the time, Mr. Hachulla would tell Mr. Robertson to either meet him on a project site or meet at his house at a specified time, and Mr. Robertson would try to be there for that time.\nV. ANALYSIS A. The Law [39] In this case, this Court must determine whether Mr. Robertson was, during the Period, employed by Creative Concepts under an express or implied contract of service, written or oral, pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA and paragraph 6(1)(a) of the CPP. To make this determination, this Court must determine whether the relationship between Mr. Robertson and Creative Concepts was one of independent contractor or of employer-employee.[3]\n[40] Consequently, the central question that this Court has to answer is whether Mr. Robertson has, on the basis of the facts, rendered services as a person in business on his own account during the Period.[4] If the Court finds that Mr. Robertson has rendered services to Creative Concepts as a person in business on his own account, then the Court will conclude that Mr. Robertson was not engaged in insurable and pensionable employment. Conversely, if the Court finds that Mr. Robertson did not render services as a person in business on his own account, the Court will conclude that Mr. Robertson was engaged in insurable and pensionable employment.\n[41] In 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) v. Minister of National Revenue, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the leading decisions on the central question of whether or not an individual has rendered services as a person in business on his or her own account are its decision in Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. MNR and the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc.[5] Given the number of decisions that have relied on Connor Homes since then, I am of the view that Connor Homes has become a leading decision on this question as well.\n(1) The Test to Be Applied in Order to Answer the Central Question [42] In Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., the Supreme Court discussed the test to be applied in this case. I summarize the Supreme Court\u2019s statements as follows:\n-There is no one conclusive test that can be universally applied in order to determine whether a person provides services as an independent contractor or as an employee.[6]\n-In determining whether a person provides services as an independent contractor or as an employee, the courts must always search for the total relationship of the parties.[7]\n-In order to assess the total relationship of the parties, the most a court can do is to examine all the possible factors bearing on the nature of the relationship between them.[8]\n-Not all factors are relevant in all cases, or have the same weight. Furthermore, the Court stated that there is no magic formula for determining which factors should, in any given case, be the determining ones.[9]\n-The level of control that the employer has over the worker\u2019s activities is always a factor to take into consideration. Other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her own equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the degree of financial risk taken by the worker, the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker, and the worker\u2019s chance of profit in the performance of his or her tasks.[10] These factors do not constitute an exhaustive list, and there is no set formula as to their application.\n-The relative weight of each factor in the determination that has to be made will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of a case.[11]\n[43] In Connor Homes, the Federal Court of Appeal revisited the test established in Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., as well as the idea of using the parties\u2019 intention as a consideration in applying the test. This idea was raised by the Federal Court of Appeal in Wolf v. R.[12] and in Royal Winnipeg Ballet v. M.N.R.,[13] which both put forward using intention as a first consideration in applying the test.[14] The Court stated that when determining whether a person provides services as an independent contractor or as an employee, the courts must use a two-step process of inquiry.[15]\n[44] Under the first step, the courts must ascertain the subjective intent of each party to the relationship. This means determining whether the parties shared a common intention or mutual understanding about the legal nature of their relationship.[16]\n[45] In order to determine the intention of the parties with respect to their relationship, the courts should look either to the written contractual relationship that the parties have entered into or to the actual behaviour of each party. Assessing the actual behaviour includes considering whether invoices for services rendered were issued, whether the provider of the services was registered for GST purposes, and whether the worker filed his or her income tax returns as an independent contractor.[17]\n[46] In my view, the first element to look for is whether there is a written agreement between the parties. If the parties entered into such an agreement, and the agreement clearly states the nature of the relationship, there is no need to look at their behaviour. The same applies if, in their respective testimony, the parties both clearly state what their common intent was. I consider that the parties\u2019 behaviour should be taken into consideration only when the parties did not enter into a written agreement; when a written agreement does not clearly state the nature of the relationship; or when the parties\u2019 testimony indicating that they had a common intent is not credible, and therefore not reliable. This is so because in my view, since the Court is looking to identify what the parties\u2019 subjective intent was, a written agreement is sufficient to establish that fact and should not be ignored. If the parties have a clear agreement, what a party does afterwards, such as becoming registered for GST purposes or filing an income tax return as an independent contractor, becomes irrelevant for determining the parties\u2019 subjective intent. This is the case because these actions can be completed without the knowledge of the other party after an agreement has been reached and the common intent has been agreed upon by the parties.\n[47] Therefore, under the first step, the Court can either conclude that the parties shared a common intent and identify what it was, or conclude that the parties did not share a common intent.\n[48] Under the second step, the courts must ascertain whether an objective reality sustains the subjective intent of the parties. This is done by taking into consideration all of the relevant factors from the objective facts of a case, including the factors mentioned in Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. and Wiebe Door Services Ltd., and examining whether these factors are consistent with the subjective intent of the parties.[18]\n[49] The Court stated that the subjective intent of the parties cannot trump the reality of the relationship as ascertained through the objective facts.[19] Consequently, in my view, where the parties share a common subjective intent but the objective facts are clearly inconsistent with that common shared intent, the shared subjective intent of the parties should not be given any weight. On the other hand, the parties\u2019 common subjective intent should be given some weight in a situation where some of the objective facts support the common subjective intent and some do not. Obviously, if the objective facts are completely consistent with the subjective intent of the parties, the parties\u2019 common subjective intent should be given weight.\n[50] In my opinion, this reasoning is consistent with statements made by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes with respect to the parties' intent. I summarize the Court\u2019s statements in Connor Homes, as follows:\n-The legal effect that results from the parties\u2019 relationship, i.e., the legal effect of the contract, is not a matter which the parties can simply stipulate in the contract, and it cannot simply be left to be decided at the sole discretion of the parties.[20]\n-It is insufficient for parties to simply state in a contract that the services are provided as an independent contractor to make it so.[21]\n-The legal effect of the relationship between the parties cannot be left to their sole discretion. According to the Court, this is because an employee-employer relationship has important and far-reaching legal and practical ramifications extending to, among other things, social programs (eligibility and financial contributions thereto), labour relations (union status) and taxation (GST registration and status under the Income Tax Act).[22]\n[51] Therefore, I consider that the determination of the parties\u2019 intent under the first step serves the two purposes. They are as follows:\nIt will determine the starting point of the analysis to be conducted under the second step of the test, as well as the purpose of the analysis. If the Court finds that the parties had a common intent in step one, then in step two, the Court will determine whether or not the relevant factors in the circumstances support the parties\u2019 common intent.\nIf the Court finds that the parties had a different intent or none at all, then in step two, the Court will determine the nature of the relationship based on the relevant factors in the circumstances, excluding the intent of each party.\nIt will determine whether the parties\u2019 intent is a factor to take into consideration in the second step of the test. If the Court concludes that the parties had a common intent, then the intent will be a factor to take into consideration in the second step of the test, along with the other relevant factors.\n[52] With respect to the purpose and use of the parties\u2019 common intent in the two-step test, a statement made by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes was recently discussed by this Court, namely in Insurance Institute of Ontario v. M.N.R.[23] This case was not brought to my attention at trial, and the parties did not comment on it. The relevant passage of Connor Homes is the following:\nIn this case, the Tax Court Judge appears to have proceeded in an inverse order, dealing with the parties\u2019 intent as set out in their mutual contracts at the end of his analysis. The first step of the analysis should always be to determine at the outset the intent of the parties and then, using the prism of that intent, determining in a second step whether the parties\u2019 relationship, as reflected in objective reality, is one of employer-employee or of independent contractor. However, in the circumstances of this case, the inverse order of analysis followed by the Tax Court Judge is not in itself sufficient to vitiate the decision since the evidence, taken as a whole, supports the conclusions reached by the judge.[24]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[53] Relying on this statement, the appellant in Insurance Institute of Ontario argued that the results of the first step should affect the application of the test in the second step. The Minister did not agree. This Court agreed with the appellant and came to the following conclusion:\nTaking all of the above into account, I favour the Institute\u2019s interpretation of the second step of the Connor Homes test. I find that the results of the first step affect the application of the test in the second step. Respectfully, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the second step is illogical. If the outcome of the first step had no bearing on the second step, then what purpose would the first step serve? If the sole question to be determined was what the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors indicated the relationship was, then why bother considering what the parties believed the relationship to be? For the first step to mean something, the outcome of the first step has to have an impact on the application of the test in the second step.[25]\n[Emphases added]\n[54] In Insurance Institute of Ontario, this Court\u2019s description of the application of the second step of the Connor Homes test is as follows:\nBased on all of the foregoing, I conclude that the second step of the Connor Homes test should be applied as follows:\na) Where the payor and the worker do not share a common intention, their relationship will be the relationship indicated by the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors.\nb) Where the payor and the worker share a common intention:\ni. if the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are consistent with that common intention, then their relationship will be the relationship that they intended;\nii. if the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are completely inconsistent with that common intention, then their relationship will be the relationship indicated by those factors; and\niii. if the Wiebe Door and Sagaz factors are inconsistent with that common intention but the parties nonetheless act and carry on their relationship in a manner that is similar to what one would expect from their intentions, then their relationship will be the relationship that they intended.[26]\n[55] Given what I have indicated earlier in this decision, I agree with these statements. For clarity, my view of the application of the test can be summarized as follows:\nStep 1: The Court must determine whether the parties had a common intention.\nStep 2: If the parties did not have a common intention then the Court must, using all the relevant factors in the circumstances, including those listed in Wiebe Door Services Ltd. and in Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., determine the nature of the actual relationship between the parties. In these circumstances, the intent of each party is not a relevant factor, and the weight to be given to each factor is determined by the judge.\nIf the parties had a common intention then the Court must, using all the relevant factors in the circumstances, including those listed in Wiebe Door Services Ltd. and in Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., determine whether that intention is supported by the objective reality of their relationship. In these circumstances, the parties\u2019 common intention is a factor to take into consideration and the weight to be given to each factor is determined by the judge.\n(2) The Application of the Law to the Facts of This Case (a) The First Step: The Intention of the Parties\/The Parties\u2019 Understanding of Their Relationship\n[56] Under the first step, this Court must ascertain the subjective intent of each party to the relationship.\n[57] Mr. Robertson did not provide his services to Mr. Hachulla under a written contract. The evidence shows that he provided his services under an express oral contract for service and not under a contract of service. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Robertson was to provide his services as a person in business on his own account, so as an independent contractor. The parties\u2019 testimony confirms this fact, as do text messages submitted in evidence at trial.\n[58] As a result, the Court finds that the parties\u2019 common intention was for their contractual relationship to be one of independent contractor.\n(b) The Second Step: Whether in Reality, After Taking Into Consideration All the Relevant Factors in the Circumstances, the Actual Relationship Sustains the Parties\u2019 Common Intent\n[59] Under the second step, the Court must ascertain whether in reality, after taking into consideration all the relevant factors in the circumstances, the relationship of the parties was the one that they intended.\n[60] The Court finds that in the circumstances, the relevant factors are the following:\n-the level of control that Creative Concepts had over Mr. Robertson\u2019s activities;\n-whether Mr. Robertson provided his own equipment;\n-whether Mr. Robertson could hire workers to provide his services;\n-whether Mr. Robertson had a chance of profit in the performance of his tasks while providing services to Creative Concepts;\n-whether Mr. Robertson managed and assumed financial risks while providing services to Creative Concepts;\n-the frequency of the payments for services rendered; and\n-the invoices for services rendered.\n(1) The Level of Control That Creative Concepts Had Over Mr. Robertson\u2019s Activities [61] The control factor has also been referred to by the courts as the \u201ccontrol test\u201d.[27] Control refers to the payer\u2019s right to give orders and instructions to the worker regarding the manner in which to carry out work.[28] Other indicators used in analyzing the control factor are the scheduling of working hours, the policies and procedures used at work, and the location of the workplace.[29] The more control the payer has over a worker, the more this is an indication that the relationship is one of employer-employee.\n[62] Mr. Hachulla scheduled the date and time that Mr. Robertson had to begin working on projects. Mr. Robertson needed to notify him if he was sick and could not provide his services. Mr. Hachulla told Mr. Robertson which project to prioritize and which worksite to go to on a specific day. During the Period, Mr. Robertson was required to provide services every weekday.\n[63] The fact that Mr. Hachulla required that workers notify him when they hired new workers to work on a project site is a factor that supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts. The level of control that Mr. Hachulla had over Mr. Robertson\u2019s work schedule also supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts. The Court finds that the level of control that Creative Concepts had over Mr. Robertson\u2019s activities supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts.\n(2) Whether Mr. Robertson Provided His Own Equipment [64] When a worker uses his or her own tools and equipment in order to provide their services, it is an indicator that he or she is providing services as an independent contractor.[30] The use by the worker of his or her own vehicle for work-related activities is also an indication of being an independent contractor.[31] Conversely, the more the payer supplies the tools and equipment for the worker\u2019s work-related activities, the more likely that their contractual relationship is one of employer-employee.\n[65] Creative Concepts provided Mr. Robertson with all of the tools and equipment that he needed to perform his work, including the heavy machinery. Mr. Robertson used only one or two of his own small tools because of personal preference. While Creative Concepts let Mr. Robertson use the Truck to travel between his home and the worksites as a courtesy to Mr. Robertson, the evidence shows that Mr. Robertson used the Truck to go directly from his home to suppliers\u2019 locations to pick up material for Creative Concepts projects, which was convenient for Creative Concepts.\n[66] Mr. Hachulla provided almost all the tools and equipment for Mr. Robertson\u2019s work-related activities. Because of this, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts.\n(3) Whether Mr. Robertson Could Hire Workers to Provide His Services [67] When a person providing services can hire their own workers to help them provide their services, it is an indicator that the relationship between the payer and the person is one of independent contractor. In this case, Mr. Robertson had his spouse coming to provide services with him for Creative Concepts. According to the evidence, this happened a few times, but the exact number of times is unclear. Mr. Robertson had to ask permission from Mr. Hachulla before bringing a new worker on a project site. This requirement applied to Mr. Robertson\u2019s spouse, and permission was obtained before she came to a project site.\n[68] Mr. Robertson had to ask Mr. Hachulla for permission before bringing a new worker on a project site. Because of this, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts. To the Court\u2019s knowledge, a subcontractor does not need to obtain permission in order to bring new people on a worksite.\n(4) Whether Mr. Robertson Had a Chance of Profit in the Performance of His Tasks While Providing Services to Creative Concepts\n[69] When a worker can increase the amount of money that he or she makes by working efficiently to complete more projects, he or she has a chance of profit. The more a worker has a chance of profit, the more this indicates that the worker is an independent contractor.[32] If a worker is paid at a set wage per hour, this limits that worker\u2019s ability to profit from being more efficient and is likely to indicate an employer-employee relationship.\n[70] The evidence shows that Mr. Robertson was paid at an hourly rate of $25. Mr. Hachulla testified that Creative Concepts paid his workers this way because he had previously paid them a fixed amount per project and this was costly. Mr. Hachulla stated that while other workers did complete the projects faster when paid per project, the work was not done properly and had to be redone at his expense.\n[71] The evidence shows that Mr. Robertson did not have a chance of profit when he was providing services to Creative Concepts. Because of this, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts.\n(5) Whether Mr. Robertson Managed and Assumed Financial Risks While Providing Services to Creative Concepts [72] This factor pertains to the risk that workers will lose money while performing their work-related activities. For example, if a worker who completes a project has the obligation to redo the work at no cost to the payer when the project is poorly done, this is likely to indicate that the worker is an independent contractor.[33]\n[73] The evidence shows that while providing services to Creative Concepts, Mr. Robertson did not assume any financial risk. In this case, it was Creative Concepts that assumed the financial risks on all projects, including those that Mr. Robertson worked on. The evidence shows if a project completed by Mr. Robertson had to be redone, Mr. Robertson would have been paid to redo the work correctly. It was Creative Concepts\u2019 financial loss if a project required additional work to complete a project, not Mr. Robertson\u2019s.\n[74] Because Mr. Robertson did not assume any financial risk while providing services to Creative Concepts, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts.\n(6) The Frequency of the Payments for Services Rendered [75] Mr. Robertson was paid by Creative Concepts every two weeks by cheque. Mr. Robertson was paid an hourly rate for his services.\n[76] The evidence shows that Mr. Robertson was paid at a regular interval, which is similar to how employees are paid by their employers. Because of this, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an employee of Creative Concepts.\n(7) The Invoices for Services Rendered [77] Mr. Robertson provided invoices to Creative Concepts for his services.\n[78] Employees do not provide invoices to their employers. Because Mr. Robertson provided invoices to Creative Concepts for his services, the Court finds that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Robertson was an independent contractor.\nVI. CONCLUSION [79] In this case, the central question that this Court had to answer was whether Mr. Robertson had, during the Period, rendered services to Creative Concepts as a person in business on his own account.\n[80] After a review of the relevant factors in the circumstances, the Court finds that during the Period, the relationship that the parties had established in reality was not the one that they had intended, which was one of independent contractor The Court finds that Mr. Robertson did not provide services to Creative Concepts as a person in business on his own account and that therefore, he did not provide services as an independent contractor. The Court finds that, following the analysis of the relevant factors in paragraphs 60 to 78 above, the majority of these factors do not support the parties\u2019 subjective intent. The factors support the conclusion that the contractual relationship between the parties was one of employer-employee.\n[81] Consequently, the Court finds that Mr. Robertson was employed under a contract of service and was thus an employee of Creative Concepts during the Period. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA, Mr. Robertson was engaged in insurable employment during the Period. On the basis of the same finding, Mr. Robertson was engaged in pensionable employment during the Period pursuant to paragraph 6(1)(a) of the CPP.\n[82] For all these reasons, the appeal is dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 19th day of May 2023.\n\u201cSylvain Ouimet\u201d\nOuimet J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 63\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-1116(EI) 2020-1579(CPP)\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nKevin Lee Hachulla AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING AND BEN ROBERTSON\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nVancouver, British Columbia\nDATE OF HEARING:\nSeptember 12, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Sylvain Ouimet\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nMay 19, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nJonathan Cooper\nSpencer Landsiedel\nFor the Intervenor:\nThe Intervenor himself\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] S.C. 1996, c. 23, para. 5(1)(a) (\u201cEIA\u201d).\n[2] R.S.C. 1985, c.

Introduction [1] Allan Werstein appealed the Minister of National Revenue\u2019s decision to impose a penalty for the false information contained in his 2009 income tax return. Like hundreds of taxpayers who used Fiscal Arbitrator tax preparers, Mr. Werstein claimed significant fictitious business losses to obtain refunds with respect to tax already withheld from his employment income in 2009 and in three previous taxation years.\n[2] Although Mr. Werstein filed this appeal, the Respondent bears the burden of establishing that the Minister correctly assessed the penalty in the circumstances of his case.\n[3] Applying the framework for Fiscal Arbitrator penalty appeals established by this Court in Torres,[1] I find that the Respondent has met that burden. Mr. Werstein was wilfully blind to the false statements in his income tax return. The determinative factors in this case are the blatantness of the false statements and the magnitude of the advantage in his return. Mr. Werstein ignored those warning signs in order to obtain a significant tax refund.\nII. Analysis [4] Mr. Werstein does not deny that his 2009 income tax return contained false statements. As a result, the only question in this appeal is whether he made those false statements knowingly or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence, pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act.[2]\n[5] Counsel for the Appellant and the Respondent helpfully focused their submissions on what they considered the relevant factors under the Torres framework and the significant body of Fiscal Arbitrator penalty cases. I have adopted a similar approach to explain why Mr. Werstein\u2019s appeal cannot succeed.\nA. Wilful blindness under the Torres framework [6] Knowledge of a false statement can be imputed by wilful blindness. A taxpayer who does not want to know, or turns a blind eye to the truth and accuracy of statements made in their income tax return is wilfully blind.[3] The knowledge requirement is satisfied when a taxpayer chooses not to make inquiries, in circumstances that suggest inquiries should be made.\n[7] If Mr. Werstein ignored the warning signs identified in the Torres framework, the penalty will apply.\n[8] Mr. Werstein testified at the hearing, primarily regarding the circumstances surrounding the filing of his 2009 income tax return.[4] While he admitted his failings in this regard, his evidence was not always credible or reliable. He was unable to adequately explain why he filed his return notwithstanding the warnings signs evident in the blatant false statements and the unusually large tax refund claimed.\n(i) education and experience\n[9] I accept that Mr. Werstein\u2019s Grade 12 education, St. Clair College certificate in \u201cMachine, Tools, Technology\u201d, and shift work employment at Ford Motor Company do not constitute significant financial education and experience.\n[10] However, I do not accept his counsel\u2019s submission that this is where \u201cthe Minister\u2019s case comes to a halt.\u201d Mr. Werstein\u2019s education and experience were not so limited that he could ignore significant warning signs. This factor is not determinative and must be considered with the Torres framework as a whole.[5]\n[11] Mr. Werstein had been employed with Ford Motor Company since 1983, earning over $90,000 in 2009. He was in charge of the household finances for his family of four, renewed a mortgage with the Bank of Montreal every five years, and held RRSP investments with the same bank.\n[12] The Fiscal Arbitrator program was not complex. It was not based on intricate series of transactions, obscure technical provisions of the Income Tax Act, or extensive financial statements and records. It was supported by a single document, a Statement of Business or Professional Activities, with limited information regarding Mr. Werstein\u2019s purported business activities.\n[13] Mr. Werstein did not need extensive financial education or experience to recognize that claiming $320,000 in business losses when he was not operating a business was blatantly false.\n(ii) the blatantness of the false statements\n[14] The false statements in this case were readily detectible.\n[15] Mr. Werstein signed his income tax return, with attached Statement of Business or Professional Activities and Request for Loss Carryback forms, containing the following significant and blatant false statements:\n(a)gross business income of $116,746.30 from \u201cRECEIPTS AS AGENT\u201d;\n(b)total business expenses of $436,909.80 listed as \u201cother expenses\u201d from \u201cAMT TO PRINCIPAL FR AGENT\u201d;\n(c)a net business loss of $320,163.50; and\n(d)a loss of $221,225.96 as total income.\n[16] Mr. Werstein testified that he saw \u201csome big numbers\u201d when he received his completed income tax return for signing. He asked his tax preparer, Bruce Blair, about them and was told that, \u201cWe\u2019re the professionals. It\u2019s been done professionally. Sign it and send it.\u201d Mr. Werstein then signed his return.\n[17] Mr. Werstein did not provide any details regarding the questions he asked Mr. Blair. Instead, he testified that he assumed that the big numbers related to an investment in a so-called Whitby land project (\u201cWhitby Project\u201d) made through the same tax preparers. However, there is no reference to the Whitby Project, or any type of land investment, in his income tax return.\n[18] Although Mr. Werstein had never owned a business, he signed the income tax return and Request for Loss Carryback form claiming substantial business losses and making other false statements with respect to his income.\n(iii) the magnitude of the advantage\n[19] Based on these false statements, Mr. Werstein claimed a refund of $25,981.85. That amount represented a complete refund of the taxes withheld from his employment income in 2009. Mr. Werstein knew this refund would be higher than what he usually received, since his refunds in previous years when he filed his income tax returns with H&R Block were not more than a few thousand dollars.\n(iv) incomprehensible explanations by the tax preparer\n[20] Before he signed and filed his income tax return, Mr. Werstein signed a series of documents with his tax preparers on November 23, 2009. One document, an \u201cApplication and Agreement (Alternative Tax Filing Education Information)\u201d related specifically to the Fiscal Arbitrators program. No details regarding the program were included.\n[21] Mr. Werstein stated that he did not understand most of the documents he signed and that he would have discussed them with Bruce Blair. However, he did not recall those discussions, or whether he understood Bruce Blair\u2019s explanations. He stated that, \u201cMany times I left there confused because of his, I wouldn\u2019t say doubletalk, but the way he described things.\u201d\n[22] Mr. Werstein said he assumed that the documents he signed related to the Whitby Project. However, Mr. Werstein\u2019s evidence in this regard was unreliable because he was unable to provide details or supporting documents for this purported investment.\n[23] Mr. Werstein\u2019s evidence regarding the false statements in his 2009 income tax return was similarly unreliable, as well as lacking credibility. His assertions that he relied on professionals are not sufficient in the circumstances, especially considering that he made no effort to ensure that he was in fact dealing with professionals.\n[24] Mr. Werstein was introduced to Bruce Blair by a colleague at Ford Motor Company. He did not determine whether Bruce Blair had experience in investments or tax preparation. Mr. Werstein relied on a verbal recommendation, and the outward trappings of a \u201cvery professional, very legitimate looking business\u201d with a secretary and \u201cplaques on the wall with certificates\u201d.\n(v) prior knowledge of the tax preparer\n[25] With respect this Torres factor, both parties relied on the fact that Mr. Werstein previously used Bruce Blair to prepare his 2008 income tax return in support of their positions.\n[26] In 2008, Mr. Werstein claimed a tax credit based on $35,000 in charitable donation tax receipts issued under a gifting arrangement that only required him to make a $5,000 cash payment. The Minister disallowed the entire claim, but reversed the decision in part, the month before Mr. Werstein filed his 2009 income tax return.\n[27] Mr. Werstein\u2019s counsel submitted that Mr. Werstein was therefore entitled to unquestioningly rely on the 2009 Fiscal Arbitrator return because he had just received a refund based on the 2008 program promoted by Bruce Blair.\n[28] The Respondent submitted that this 2008 filing history constitutes additional warning signs that Bruce Blair had improper practices. The Minister reversed her position regarding the claimed credit based on representations from Bruce Blair that a $30,000 tax receipt had been issued by another registered charity. However, Mr. Werstein admitted he did not receive a tax receipt from that organization.[6]\n[29] I am not persuaded by either party\u2019s position. The 2008 income tax return was not prepared by Fiscal Arbitrators and involved a separate claim supported, at least superficially, by two donation receipts totalling $35,000.\n[30] By contrast, Mr. Werstein reported a fictitious business loss of almost ten times that amount in 2009. The $320,163.50 net business loss was not supported by any documentation. There was no basis for Mr. Werstein to simply accept the \u201cbig numbers\u201d and sign the return. To the extent that the circumstances surrounding the 2008 filing is relevant, it supports the imposition of the penalty, but not in the way proposed by the Respondent.\n(vi) failure to make inquiries with third parties\n[31] The warning signs were significant enough that Mr. Werstein\u2019s failure to make inquiries with a third party also establishes wilful blindness. Despite the big numbers and his overall confusion, Mr. Werstein did not consult with his previous tax preparers at H&R Block, the Canada Revenue Agency, his friends, or his family.\nIII. Conclusion [32] To promote taxpayer honesty in Canada\u2019s self-assessing tax system, subsection 163(2) permits the Minister to impose a penalty on a taxpayer who knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, makes a false statement in filing an income tax return.\n[33] Mr. Werstein is liable for this penalty because he should have known better. He chose to ignore the obvious false statements in his income tax return in order to obtain substantial refunds of taxes withheld from his employment income.\n[34] The appeal is therefore dismissed, with costs to the Respondent in accordance with the Tariff.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of May 2023.\n\u201cJoanna Hill\u201d\nHill J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 64\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2013-1185(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nALLAN WERSTEIN V.

Mr. Werstein conceded this issue in light of the Respondent\u2019s submissions relying on authorities establishing that the formula includes losses available for use other taxation years, notwithstanding the greater financial consequences. (See for example, Wardlaw v HMTQ, 2019 TCC 199, paras 11-14.)\n[3] Wynter v HMTQ, 2017 FCA 195, paras 13 and 16.\n[4] The Respondent relied on the testimony and evidence of a Canada Revenue Agency officer, Janilee Sawatzky, who worked on the audit leading up to the penalty assessment. While she gave credible, reliable evidence, it was not relevant to the analysis under the Torres framework.\n[5] See Manhue v HMTQ, 2018 TCC 71, where this Court held that the education and experience bar is not overly high (para 32), and reviewed other cases applying this factor (paras 33-37).\n[6] Mr. Werstein received two tax receipts from Greater Works Ministries of Canada, but Bruce Blair made representations to the Minister on Mr. Werstein\u2019s behalf that the second receipt for $30,000 was issued by Furry World\u2019s Rescue Mission.\n",

(\u201cCAMI\u201d) and Credential Securities Inc. (\u201cCSI\u201d) pursuant to agreements to promote and sell CAMI mutual funds and CSI securities to Westminster\u2019s members.\nIssue\n[2] The question is whether the services provided by Westminster to CAMI\/CSI were preparatory in nature and fell within the exception under paragraph (r.4) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d. If so, then the services were not GST-exempt and the appellant was obliged to collect and remit tax for the reporting periods from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016.\nPreliminary matter\n[3] At the commencement of the hearing, the parties advised that the respondent concedes the issue of whether Westminster was required to collect and remit GST with respect to consideration received for services provided to Desjardins Financial Group regarding the issuance of credit cards to members during the reporting periods under appeal.\nFactual background\n[4] The parties filed a Statement of Partial Agreed Facts and an Agreed Book of Documents, from which I have selected the relevant facts described below.\nWestminster Savings Credit Union\n[5] The appellant was created on January 1, 2020, through the amalgamation of Prospera Credit Union and Westminster Savings Credit Union (\u201cWestminster\u201d).[1] Westminster was incorporated in British Columbia on October 19, 1944.[2] During the period under appeal, Westminster was governed by the B.C. Credit Union Incorporation Act.[3] Westminster\u2019s primary business was to act as a credit union, collecting deposits from its members and paying interest to them on their deposits.[4] Westminster had approximately 57,000 members, as well as 12 full-service offices and a head office (all in B.C.).[5]\n[6] Westminster provided its members with various wealth management services such as assistance with financial planning, estate planning, tax planning, income protection, investment management, and insurance planning. It also had a third- party arrangement under which credit cards were provided to its members.[6] Westminster was not authorized to sell mutual funds or securities to its members.[7]\nCredential Asset Management Inc. and Credential Securities Inc.\n[7] CAMI was incorporated in Ontario in 1987.[8] During the period under appeal, it was a member of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (\u201cMFDA\u201d) and authorized to sell mutual funds.[9] CAMI sold mutual funds to members of the public and received fees for the sales.[10]\n[8] CSI was incorporated federally in 1995.[11] During the period under appeal, it was a member of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (\u201cIIROC\u201d) and authorized to sell securities such as mutual funds, shares, and bonds.[12] CSI sold securities to members of the public and received fees for the sales.[13]\nWestminster\u2019s agreements with CAMI and CSI\n[9] Westminster dealt at arm\u2019s length with both CAMI and CSI.[14] It entered into participation agreements with CAMI and CSI on April 27, 2001, and May 6, 2016, respectively.[15] The agreement with CAMI was amended on March 31, 2004, to add certain definitions as well as provisions dealing with insurance and indemnification.[16]\n[10] The participation agreements stated that Westminster would provide certain services to CAMI and CSI, in return for payments of fees from them.[17] If the CAMI mutual funds\/CSI securities were purchased through dual employees\/investment advisors (described below under the heading \u201cDual employees and Investment advisors\u201d), then Westminster would receive fees from CAMI\/CSI; otherwise, it would not.[18] More specifically:\na)with respect to CAMI \u2013 CAMI paid to Westminster fees equalling a percentage of the distribution fees and service fees received by CAMI from the issuers of mutual funds. The percentage of distribution fees depended on the volume of sales while the percentage of service fees depended on whether Westminster used CAMI\u2019s electronic data transfer system to record mutual fund transactions;[19] and\nb)with respect to CSI \u2013 CSI paid to Westminster fees equalling a percentage of the commissions received by CSI from selling securities.[20]\n[11] During the period under appeal, Westminster received the following fees from CAMI and CSI, on which it did not collect or remit GST:[21]\nYear\nAmount\n2013\n$4,811,448\n2014\n$4,995,195\n2015\n$4,435,396\n2016\n$3,963,308\nDual employees and Investment advisors\n[12] Under the respective participation agreements, Westminster and CAMI\/CSI jointly hired employees to provide the services agreed upon. Under the CAMI agreement, the employees were referred to as dual employees while under the CSI agreement, they were referred to as investment advisors.[22] In both instances, these employees worked out of Westminster\u2019s offices and were supervised by Westminster.[23]\n[13] The dual employees\/investment advisors reported only to Westminster with respect to their day-to-day activities.[24] Westminster paid the cost of training the dual employees\/investment advisors to provide services to members relating to CAMI\u2019s\/CSI\u2019s products.[25] The dual employees\/investment advisors also attended CAMI\/CSI courses to ensure that they met MFDA or IIROC regulatory standards, as the case may be; Westminster arranged for their attendance and paid fees to CAMI\/CSI in this regard.[26]\n[14] The dual employees (i.e. Westminster\/CAMI) were required to be licensed by the MFDA while the investment advisors (i.e. Westminster\/CSI) were required to be licensed by IIROC in order to deal with, advise as to, and sell mutual funds and securities, respectively.[27] Westminster paid the licensing fees in both instances.[28]\n[15] In 2013, 2014, 2015, and the first quarter of 2016, the jointly-hired employees consisted solely of dual employees (i.e. selling CAMI mutual funds).[29] After the first quarter of 2016, the complement included investment advisors (i.e. selling CSI securities).[30]\n[16] If a member decided to buy mutual funds or securities, then the dual employee\/investment advisor would:\na)collect information from the member to complete the necessary paperwork, or assist the member in completing it; and\nb)send the completed paperwork to CAMI\/CSI for review. If the paperwork was in order, then the purchase would be made in the member\u2019s name.[31]\n[17] In a sample situation involving an investment advisor, the individual signed an employment agreement with CSI on July 23, 2016, and then a separate employment agreement with Westminster on December 16, 2016.[32] Under the Westminster employment agreement, Westminster paid him wages and other remuneration for his services as an investment advisor while under the CSI agreement, CSI was not required to pay him any wages or remuneration.[33]\n[18] In a sample situation involving a dual employee, the individual signed an employment agreement with Westminster on September 1, 2016, and then a separate employment agreement with CAMI on September 27, 2016.[34] Under the Westminster employment agreement, Westminster paid her wages and other remuneration for her services as a dual employee while under the CAMI agreement, CAMI was required to pay her $1 per year.[35]\n[19] With respect to the dual employees, CAMI and Westminster each held errors & omissions insurance under which they were each the beneficiary for their respective policies; however, Westminster paid for both policies.[36]\nMember purchases of CAMI and CSI products\n[20] When members bought CAMI mutual funds or CSI securities through Westminster, the members would instruct Westminster to withdraw money from their Westminster account and deposit it in a special trust account created by Westminster. CAMI\/CSI then removed funds from that trust account on a daily basis and used the money to pay for the mutual funds\/securities in question.[37]\n[21] The Court also heard the testimony of Susan Lovell (former VP of Finance for the appellant and for Westminster since 2015) and Kevin Dombrova (current VP of Wealth Planning for the appellant and Director of Wealth Management for Westminster since 2015).\nLegislative framework\n[22] A person who makes a taxable supply is obliged to collect GST on that supply, on behalf of the federal Crown.[38] A \u201ctaxable supply\u201d in turn means a supply made in the course of a commercial activity.[39] \u201cCommercial activity\u201d is defined in the Act and for the purposes of this appeal, it is only important to know that a commercial activity specifically excludes the making of exempt supplies.[40]\nFinancial services are exempt\n[23] The starting point is that other than exported financial services (which are zero-rated),[41] financial services are GST-exempt pursuant to Schedule V, Part VII of the Act. The definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d[42] lists various types of services and the relevant portions are as follows:\n\u201cfinancial service\u201d means\n...\n(d) the issue, granting, allotment, acceptance, endorsement, renewal, processing, variation, transfer of ownership or repayment of a financial instrument,\n...\n(l) the agreeing to provide, or the arranging for, a service that is\n(i) referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (i), and\n(ii) not referred to in any of paragraphs (n) to (t),\n...\nbut does not include\n(r.4) a service (other than a prescribed service) that is preparatory to the provision or the potential provision of a service referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (i) and (l), or that is provided in conjunction with a service referred to in any of those paragraphs, and that is\n(i) a service of collecting, collating or providing information, or\n(ii) a market research, product design, document preparation, document processing, customer assistance, promotional or advertising service or a similar service,\n\u2026\n[24] For the purposes of this appeal, the services in question must fall within paragraphs (d) and (l) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d while falling outside paragraph (r.4) of the definition, in order to be exempt from tax. It is undisputed by the parties that the CAMI and CSI products in question are financial instruments, so paragraph (d) of the definition is not in issue.\nDiscussion and analysis\n[25] The parties agree that Westminster made a single compound supply to CAMI and CSI, respectively. In other words, the elements of the supply are integrally connected and a single consideration was received in return.[43]\n[26] Beginning with Global Cash Access (Canada) Inc. v. Canada,[44] the Federal Court of Appeal has stated on numerous occasions that where there is a single supply comprised of multiple elements, the analysis consists of two steps:\na)determine what services were provided for the consideration received, i.e. all services and not just the predominant ones;[45] and\nb)determine whether the supply falls within the statutory definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d. To do so, one must identify the predominant elements of the supply and consider only those when applying the definition. In other words \u2013 what is the recipient really paying for?[46]\nStep one: What was provided?\n[27] The parties agree that the specific financial service in question is captured in paragraph (l) of the definition, i.e. agreeing to provide, or arranging for, the service referred to in paragraph (d) (regarding financial instruments). They also agree that the issue is ultimately whether paragraph (r.4) applies to disqualify the providing\/arranging service as a financial service.[47]\n[28] Although expressed differently, the parties also agree that Westminster\u2019s single supply consisted of the following elements:[48]\na)completing a \u201cdiscovery\u201d process with the member to determine their goals, risk tolerance, time horizons, etc.\nb)with respect to CAMI mutual funds, a risk tolerance questionnaire was completed;\nc)collecting\/gathering the necessary personal information from the member;\nd)making investment recommendations to the member; and\ne)signing the new-account paperwork and submitting it to CAMI\/CSI.\nStep two: What are the predominant elements of the supply?\n[29] To answer this question, one must determine what gives the arrangement commercial efficacy, i.e. what is at the heart of the transaction?[49]\n[30] The fees received by Westminster from CAMI\/CSI were directly related to purchases made by members and the amount of the fees increased proportionately with sales made. Westminster would also not be paid for uncompleted transactions. In other words, even if Westminster gathered all the relevant personal information and completed the necessary forms\/questionnaires, it would not be paid by CAMI\/CSI without a completed sale.[50] On their own, these services are preparatory and provided in conjunction with the financial service in paragraph (d) of the definition (regarding financial instruments), i.e. they fit squarely within paragraph (r.4).\n[31] However, in the present situation, the dual employees\/investment advisors attended CAMI\/CSI training courses which were paid for by Westminster and intended to enable them to meet regulatory standards. They also had to be licenced by the respective regulatory bodies (MFDA for mutual funds and IIROC for securities) to deal with, advise as to, and sell these products, and Westminster paid the licensing fees.[51]\n[32] The training gave the dual employees\/investment advisors the expertise and knowledge to take the information gathered from a member respecting goals, risk tolerance, and time horizons, interpret it, and apply it by giving advice as to which products might be most suitable for the member in the circumstances. The licensing in turn gave them the legal authority to do so, as well as to close the transaction.\n[33] Regarding remuneration of the dual employees\/investment advisors, they were paid by Westminster under the respective employment agreements. The CAMI agreement also provided that CAMI would pay each dual employee an annual nominal amount of $1 which appears to have never been paid, based on Ms. Lovell\u2019s and Mr. Dombrova\u2019s testimony. The dual employees\/investment advisors reported exclusively to Westminster on their day-to-day activities and the respective participation agreements show that Westminster provided the physical space to conduct\/promote the sale of these products.[52] Therefore, although the participation agreements stated that these employees were hired jointly, the day - to - day reality suggests otherwise.\n[34] The Department of Finance Technical Notes [June 2010] say that with respect to paragraph (l) of the definition:\nThe term \u201cagreeing to provide\u201d is generally intended to refer to activities of a principal to a transaction of agreeing to provide a service referred to in any of paras. (a) to (i). The term \u201carranging for\u201d is generally intended to include intermediation activities (or activities of bringing together the parties to a service referred to in any of paras. (a) to (i) that are normally performed by financial intermediaries described in subpara. 149(1)(a)(iii) such as agents, brokers and dealers in financial instruments or money. In determining if an intermediary\u2019s service is included in para. (l), all the facts surrounding the transaction, including the degree of direct involvement of the intermediary in the supply of the service referred to in any of paras. (a) to (i), the time and effort expended by the intermediary, the reliance of either or both the supplier and the recipient on the intermediary in the course of a supply of a financial service, the intention of the intermediary and, where applicable, the normal activities of an intermediary in a given industry, must be considered (including whether the intermediary is engaged in a financial services business). Para. (l) is amended to provide, for greater certainty, that it does not include the agreeing to provide, or the arranging for, a service that is referred to in any of paras. (n) to (t). [my emphasis]\n[35] With respect to paragraph (r.4) of the definition, the same Technical Notes say that:\nNew para. (r.4) clarifies that the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d does not include a service that is preparatory to a service referred to in any of paras. (a) to (i) and (l) of the definition \u201cfinancial service\u201d, or that is provided in conjunction with such a service, and that is\na service of collecting, collating or providing information, or\na market research, product design, document preparation, document processing, customer assistance, promotional or advertising service or a similar service.\nWhere an intermediary provides a number of services as part of an agreement to provide, or arrange for financial services, only those services that are described in the two bullets above would either be preparatory to a service referred to in any of paras. (a) to (i) and (l) and would be excluded from the definition \u201cfinancial service\u201d by para. (r.4).\n[36] In considering the factors set out in these excerpts from the Finance Technical Notes, the present circumstances in their entirety show that while the preparatory aspects were certainly essential to close a transaction, they were neither the predominant element nor the only services supplied by Westminster. More specifically:\na)Westminster provided an intermediation activity by bringing together CAMI\/CSI as sellers and its own members as purchasers of the financial instruments;\nb)Westminster arranged for (but was not directly involved in) the supply of the service in paragraph (d) of the definition;\nc)the dual employees\/investment advisors operated under Westminster\u2019s umbrella with respect to remuneration, training, day-to-day supervision,licencing, and errors & omission insurance (for the dual employees), so the time and effort expended by Westminster was considerable. This makes sense in light of the quantum of the fees paid to Westminster by CAMI\/CSI during the period under appeal; and\nd)the dual employees\/investment advisors met with members, recommended suitable CAMI\/CSI products, completed the necessary paperwork, and submitted it to CAMI\/CSI, so the mutual reliance by CAMI\/CSI and the members on Westminster was considerable.\n[37] The predominant element was the sale of CAMI\/CSI mutual funds\/securities to Westminster\u2019s members, carried out by way of the dual employees\/investment advisors using their training\/licensing to recommend and sell CAMI\/CSI products to Westminster members, commensurate with the members\u2019 particular investment profiles.\n[38] Westminster arranged for the issue, granting, allotment, acceptance, endorsement, renewal, processing, variation, transfer of ownership or repayment of financial instruments, being CAMI mutual funds and CSI securities. It is the heart of the transaction and what CAMI\/CSI really paid for. Therefore, Westminster provided the exempt financial service described in paragraph (l) of the definition by arranging for the financial service described in paragraph (d).\nConclusion\n[39] The appeal is allowed, with costs.\n[40] The parties shall have until June 15, 2023 to reach an agreement as to costs, failing which the appellant shall file written submissions by July 14, 2023 and the respondent shall file a written response by August 14, 2023. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten pages in length. If the parties do not advise the court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received by these dates, then costs shall be awarded to the appellant in accordance with Tariff B.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of May 2023.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 65\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-1578(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nProspera Credit Union v.\nHis Majesty the King\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nVancouver, British Columbia\nDATE OF HEARING:\nApril 19 and 20, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nMay 10, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nJoel A.

Graham\nSubjects\nIncome Tax Act\nDecision Content\nCitation: 2023 TCC 66\nDate: 20230510\nDocket: 2021-912(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nTHE ESTATE OF VENENCE COTE,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\n(Edited from the transcript of Reasons for Judgment delivered orally from the Bench on July 6, 2022 at Toronto, Ontario for punctuation, capitalization, spelling, paragraph breaks, and accuracy; to remove repetitive phrases; to add headings, citations and paragraph numbers; and to remove submissions from the parties regarding both the timing of amendments to the reply and costs as those submissions do not form part of the Reasons for Judgment)\nGraham J.\n[1] When Mr. Cote filed his tax returns for his 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax years, he claimed donation tax credits in respect of gifts that he claimed to have made through a tax shelter known as the Global Learning Gifting Initiative (\u201cGLGI\u201d). The Minister of National Revenue reassessed Mr. Cote to deny those credits. Mr. Cote has since passed away. His estate, the Applicant in this matter, appealed the reassessments. The parties have filed their pleadings and the Applicant has brought a motion to strike more than 200 different paragraphs from the Reply on various grounds.\nA. Bases for Striking\n[2] The Applicant raises five primary bases upon which it says the relevant paragraphs should be struck. The Applicant argues that many of the paragraphs should be struck under more than one of these bases.\n[3] I will provide an overview of the five different bases before moving on to an analysis of specific paragraphs.\nIrrelevant Information\n[4] The first basis that the Applicant raises is that many of the paragraphs in the Reply contain irrelevant information about the GLGI Program that would not assist the trial judge in understanding the transactions in issue.\n[5] It is not my role as motions judge to determine the relevance of facts or assumptions of fact. As set out in Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corp. v. The Queen (2007 TCC 742) and Niagara Helicopters Ltd. v. The Queen (2003 TCC 4), that task is best left to the trial judge who will hear the entirely of the evidence. In fact, as described in Jolly Farmer Products Inc. v. The Queen (2008 TCC 124), it would be improper for the Respondent to parse the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and not disclose those that the Respondent considered irrelevant. Unless it is plain and obvious to me that a fact could never be relevant, I will not strike it.\n[6] The Applicant raised relevance in respect of many paragraphs. Except as specifically set out below, the Applicant has not convinced me that it is plain and obvious that those paragraphs could never be relevant.\nInflammatory and Prejudicial Language\n[7] Moving to the second point raised by the Applicant, the Applicant says that certain paragraphs contain inflammatory, vexatious, scandalous or prejudicial language. I will not address all of the specific instances that the Applicant has referred to.\n[8] The Applicant complains that the words \u201ctax shelter\u201d are prejudicial. I do not understand how this description could be prejudicial. The Respondent has specifically pled that the Program was registered as a tax shelter.\n[9] The Applicant also objects to the use of the word \u201cpurported\u201d to describe the donations claimed by Mr. Cote and other taxpayers. The Applicant says that the word is prejudicial. In essence the Applicant is saying that the Respondent should accept defeat and admit that Mr. Cote and the other taxpayers made valid donations. There is no merit to this position. The issue before the Court is whether Mr. Cote made donations. Of course the Respondent will want to describe them as purported donations, just as the Applicant will want to describe them as donations. There is nothing prejudicial about either of them doing so.\n[10] It may be that many members of the public would find it immoral to attempt to profit through the use of a charitable donation scheme. If the purpose of the paragraphs dealing with the alleged sham and the Applicant\u2019s purported lack of donative intent were simply to paint the Applicant in a bad or immoral light, then it would be entirely appropriate to strike those paragraphs. However, that is not their purpose.\n[11] The situation is entirely distinguishable from that in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. The Queen (2013 FCA 122) where pleadings that went to the morality of the transaction in question were struck. Those pleadings were struck because the morality of the transaction in question had nothing to do with their taxation.\n[12] I am not saying that morality is an issue in this appeal, but the sham and the purported lack of donative intent are at issue in this appeal.\nMixed Fact and Law\n[13] The third issue raised by the Applicant is that certain paragraphs contain arguments or conclusions of mixed fact and law. The Applicant raised this issue in respect of a number of different paragraphs.\n[14] In certain circumstances, dealt with in more detail below, the Applicant makes a very relevant point as the Respondent has pled conclusions of mixed fact and law relating to very key issues. However, in most cases, the Applicant is simply being difficult, seeking to find conclusions of mixed fact and law where it is clear that the Respondent is simply using legal language as a simplified way of pleading what appears to be non-controversial points. Other than as set out below, I do not find any merit to this argument.\nOverly Broad and Repetitive:\n[15] The fourth point raised by the Applicant is that certain paragraphs are overly broad or repetitive. The Applicant disputes all or virtually all of the 201 assumptions of fact pled in the Reply. The Applicant makes the general complaint that the Reply is overly broad and that is unfair that the Applicant has to demolish so many assumptions of fact. It argues that doing so will cost significant amounts of money and will delay the fair hearing of the appeal and involve significant judicial resources.\n[16] I agree that, unless the parties are able to agree to a significant number of facts, the trial will be very lengthy. However, the assumptions are extensive because Mr. Cote participated in a very complex program.\n[17] The 2004 and 2005 GLGI Program was already extensively litigated in Mariano v. The Queen (2015 TCC 244). The Reply suggests that the Program in the years in question was not materially different. The Notice of Appeal provides no insights as to why the Applicant believes that the Program was materially different in the years in question or what new argument it intends to raise that has not already been canvassed in Mariano. Without any such guidance, the Respondent has no choice but to plead every fact and assumption of fact that it could possibly need to support the reassessments.\n[18] Accordingly, other than the specific instances of repetitiveness set out below, I find there is no merit to the argument.\nInformation Relating to Years Not in Issue:\n[19] Finally, the Applicant submits that many of the paragraphs in question contain information that relates to the operation of the GLGI Program in years other than the three years that the Applicant participated in the Program.\n[20] I agree with the Applicant in respect of facts pled in respect of years after the years in question. I cannot see how those facts could ever be relevant.\n[21] The Applicant also argues that since Mr. Cote only participated in the Program in 2006, 2007 and 2008, assumptions about the operation of the Program in 2004 and 2005 are both irrelevant and unfair. Here I must disagree.\n[22] While I have serious concerns regarding whether the Applicant should be required to demolish assumptions of fact relating to the operations of the GLGI Program in the years prior to the years in question, I accept the Respondent\u2019s submissions that the case law, namely the Tax Court decisions in Teelucksingh v. The Queen (2010 TCC 94) and Mudge v. The Queen (2020 TCC 77), clearly state that the question of burden, like questions of relevance, should be left to the trial judge.\n[23] Not only is the trial judge in the best position to determine relevancy, but the trial judge is also in a far better position than a judge hearing a preliminary motion to consider what effect should be given to assumptions not within the knowledge of the Applicant. It is for the trial judge to decide whether these assumptions are irrelevant or direct that the Respondent bear the onus of proving them.\n[24] On that basis, I will leave assumptions of fact regarding the operation of the GLGI Program in 2004 and 2005, assumptions of fact regarding the treatment of insiders under the Program from 2004 to 2008, and assumptions of fact relating to the operation of a similar program prior to 2004 in place. The Applicant is free to raise questions of burden in respect of these assumptions with the trial judge.\nB. Disputed Paragraphs\n[25] With that background I will now turn to analyzing the specific paragraphs in dispute, starting with paragraphs 1 to 6.\nParagraphs 1 to 6:\n[26] These paragraphs are part of an overview of the Respondent\u2019s position. In a Reply that spans 40 pages, an overview can be a useful section. It is neither inappropriate to use an overview, nor inappropriate for that overview to contain a summary of the relevant facts and arguments. Other than as set out below no changes need to be made to these paragraphs.\nParagraph 1:\n[27] Paragraph 1 introduces the defined term, \u201cthe Program.\u201d This term is then used throughout the Reply to variously refer to the GLGI Program from 2004 to 2013, from 2004 to 2008, and from 2006 to 2008. As such, it results in pleadings that are confusing or vague. I will strike the word \u201cProgram\u201d wherever it appears in the Reply.\n[28] The Respondent shall have leave to amend the Reply to add a more clearly defined term or terms that are appropriate to the contexts in which they are used.\nParagraph 2 and 18.4:\n[29] Turning then to paragraph 2, as well as paragraph 18.4, both of those paragraphs contain the phrase, \u201c56% to 112%.\u201d Because of the problem with the word \u201cProgram,\u201d it is unclear what time period these percentages cover. I will strike this phrase in both paragraphs, with leave to amend to add the appropriate percentages for the GLGI Program from 2004 to 2008.\nParagraphs 3 and 20:\n[30] Turning then to paragraph 3 and, as it is related, paragraph 20. The last sentence of paragraph 3 and all of paragraph 20 relate to the operation of the GLGI Program in 2014 and its ongoing audit. This is clearly irrelevant. I will strike these parts of the Reply without leave to amend.\nParagraph 18.5:\n[31] Paragraph 18.5 contains a chart summarizing, among other things, the number of participants, purported cash donations and purported in kind donations for the GLGI Program for each year from 2004 to 2008. The Applicant has no way of knowing how many other taxpayers participated in the Program either in the years in question or in 2004 and 2005. This information is exclusively or peculiarly within the knowledge of the Minister. However, as set out above, the case law indicates that that goes to the issue of burden and that burden should be left to be dealt with by the trial judge. Accordingly, I will not strike this paragraph.\nParagraphs 18.12, 18.13, 18.28, 18.30 and 18.67:\n[32] Paragraphs 18.12, 18.13, 18.28, 18.30, and 18.67 refer to things that started before the years in question, continued throughout those years and ended sometime thereafter. I find that it is clearly irrelevant at which point these things ended. I will strike the words, \u201cuntil April 2011,\u201d in paragraph 18.12; the words, \u201cuntil May 9, 2011,\u201d in paragraph 18.13; the words, \u201cuntil April 1, 2011,\u201d in paragraph 18.28; the words, \u201cearly 2011,\u201d in paragraph 18.30; and the words, \u201cto 2011,\u201d in paragraph 18.67.\n[33] The Respondent shall have leave to amend these paragraphs to clarify that the things in question continued throughout the years in issue.\nParagraphs 18.37 to 18.39:\n[34] Turning to paragraphs 18.37 to 18.39. As they are currently phrased, these paragraphs appear on their face to either be the Minister\u2019s opinion or a conclusion. They do not appear to be assumptions of fact. I will strike them but will grant leave for the Respondent to amend.\nParagraphs 18.65, 18.160, 18.165, 18.170 and 18.172:\n[35] As currently phrased, paragraphs 18.65, 18.160, 18.165, 18.170 and 189.172 appear to be argument, not assumptions of fact. I will strike these paragraphs but will give the Respondent leave to amend.\nParagraphs 18.73, 18.161, 18.162, 18.174 and 18.191:\n[36] As currently phrased, paragraphs 18.73, 18.161, 18.162, 18.174 and 18.191 appear to be conclusions of mixed fact and law. I will strike them but will give the Respondent leave to amend.\nParagraph 18.171:\n[37] Turning then to paragraph 18.171, the Respondent has conceded that that paragraph should be struck. The heading that appears immediately before it shall also be struck but with leave to amend.\nParagraph 18.175 to 18.190:\n[38] Turning then to paragraphs 18.175 to 18.190, these paragraphs all deal with the purported sham. I am satisfied based on the decision in Chad v. The Queen (2021 TCC 45) that these paragraphs have been appropriately pled.\n[39] The phrase, \u201cin the sham,\u201d appears in paragraph 18.191. This is an inappropriate conclusion of mixed fact and law. That phrase is struck with leave to amend.\nParagraph 18.196:\n[40] Turning to paragraph 18.196, that paragraph is repetitive. I will strike it without leave to amend.\nParagraph 19\n[41] Paragraph 19 contains a chart setting out the number of participants, their purported cash donations, their purported in kind donations and the average ratio of cash to in kind donations for each year of the GLGI Program from 2004 to 2013. The information in the chart from 2004 to 2008 is the same information that appears in paragraph 18.5. As I have not struck paragraph 18.5, the information is repetitive. The information from 2009 to 2013 falls after the period in question. I find that it is clearly irrelevant. Based on the foregoing I will strike the whole of paragraph 19 without leave to amend.\n[42] This is the end of my reasons.\n[43] So we will say to September 9, 2022 to amend.\nC. Costs\n[44] I am torn here. I think both parties raise good points. There was merit to a number of the points, clearly, that the Applicant raised, but as the Respondent says, the Applicant appeared to throw everything at the wall and hope to see what would stick, which is not an efficient way of dealing with matters. Given the parties\u2019 mixed success, although I am displeased with the manner in which the Applicant proceeded, I am going to award costs in the cause.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Appellant, Garg Investments, appeals from the Minister\u2019s denial of their claim for the New Residential Rental Property Rebate (the \u201cNRRPR\u201d) pursuant to subsection 256.2(3) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] In 2017 the Appellant sought to purchase two home properties for rental purposes. The seller of these properties refused to sell to the Appellant, a corporation, but agreed to sell the homes to the shareholders of the Appellant. The Appellant eventually took sole title to the properties and applied for the NRRPR.\n[3] The NRRPR allows an individual, identified in the Act as a \u201cparticular individual\u201d, to recover a portion of the GST or HST imposed pursuant to ss. 165(1) of the Act in respect of newly constructed or substantially renovated residential rental accommodations. The claims in issue were made for two side-by-side residential rental properties purchased in Kitchener, Ontario (the \u201cWatermill properties\u201d).\n[4] The Act includes, as one of the requirements for this claim, that the particular person be the recipient of the supply. The Minister denied the Appellant\u2019s application for this rebate on the basis the Appellant was not the recipient of the supply.\nII. FACTS [5] The Appellant was incorporated under the laws of Ontario. It has three shareholders:\nSatish Kumar Garg (\u201cSatish\u201d)\nAdarsh K. Garg (\u201cAdarsh\u201d)\nVidushi Garg (\u201cVidushi\u201d)\n[6] Satish and Adarsh are spouses, and Vidushi is their daughter.\n[7] The Appellant called evidence, which was for the most part uncontested. There is very little dispute concerning the facts in this matter.\n[8] On or about July 22, 2017, the Appellant attempted to enter into an agreement of purchase and sale with Mattamy (Monarch) Limited (herein referred to as the \u201cSeller\u201d).\n[9] The Seller expressly refused to agree to a purchase and sale agreement with the Appellant, a corporation, and instead required that the transaction take place between themselves and one or more non-corporate individuals.\n[10] As such, Vidushi signed the purchase and sale agreement for a home located at 56 Watermill, Kitchener, Ontario.\n[11] Shortly after, on July 24, 2017, Vidushi entered into another purchase agreement for the neighbouring home at 58 Watermill, Kitchener, Ontario.\n[12] Adarsh was added shortly after to both purchase and sale agreements by way of an amendment to each agreement.\n[13] In both transactions, the agreements of purchase and sale only listed Vidushi and Adarsh as the buyers.\n[14] Two trust agreements (herein referred to as the \u201cTrust Agreements\u201d), one per property, were executed between the Appellant, Vidushi and Adarsh on August 2, 2017, each stating that Vidushi and Adarsh were to hold the Watermill properties for the sole benefit of the Appellant. Furthermore, the respective Watermill properties were to be transferred to the Appellant on its demand, and at all material times, the rental income, profits and losses, rights, and liabilities were to be born by the Beneficiary (the Appellant).\n[15] On November 30, 2018, both agreements of purchase and sale were amended to include Satish as one of three purchasers.\n[16] Also on November 30, 2018, the Trust Agreements were amended to include Satish as one of the three bare trustees.\n[17] On December 5, 2018, a Direction re Title was signed by all three Trustees, stating that title was to be registered under the Appellant\u2019s name. It was sent to the Seller\u2019s counsel, who issued a Statement of Adjustments to the Appellant\u2019s counsel.\n[18] The Statement of Adjustments issued by the Seller lists the Appellant\u2019s name as the purchaser.\n[19] On or about December 6, 2018, as per the parties\u2019 intention, the titles on the Watermill properties were transferred to the Appellant.\n[20] Pursuant to the Trust Agreements, the Appellant proceeded to pay the consideration and closing funds from its own account to the Seller\u2019s counsel.\n[21] Pursuant to the Trust Agreements, the Appellant also paid the GST\/HST on new housing units as is required by the Act.\n[22] The Appellant has since rented out the Watermill properties to tenants. All rent cheques have been deposited into the Appellant\u2019s corporate bank account. Additionally, the Appellant pays all the expenses such as mortgage payments, insurance premiums, property tax bills, etc., from its corporate bank account.\nIII. ISSUE [23] The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is properly the recipient of the supplies in the purchase of the Subject properties, as required by subsection 256.2(3) of the Act in order to be eligible for the NRRPR.\nIV. APPELLANT\u2019S POSITION [24] The Appellant\u2019s position is that Vidushi, Adarsh and Satish were parties to the agreement of purchase and sale only as a formality, as required by the seller. Titles to the properties were transferred to the Appellant immediately upon the completion of the purchase and sale agreement. Therefore, a denial of the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to this credit would be based upon a reliance on a mere technicality. The Appellant emphasized that Satish, Adarsh, and Vidushi never wavered in their intent for the Watermill properties to be owned and managed by the Appellant.\n[25] The Appellant also relies upon the fact that upon purchase, the Trustees (Vidushi, Adarsh and Satish) were bare trustees, holding the Watermill properties for the Appellant beneficiary until the first moment they could transfer title to the Appellant. On this basis, it is argued that the Appellant should therefore be eligible for the NRRPR.\nV. RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION [26] The Respondent argues that, pursuant to subsection 256.2(3) of the Act, only the recipient of the supply under the purchase agreement is entitled to claim the NRRPR. Since the Appellant is not the purchaser under the purchase agreements, the Appellant is also not the recipient of the supply of the subject properties. Pursuant to the definition of recipient found in subsection 123(1) of the Act, Satish, Adarsh, and Vidushi were the recipients of the supply as they had the liability to pay the consideration under the purchase and sale agreements. The Appellant is therefore not eligible for the NRRPR.\n[27] The Respondent further argues that since Satish, Adarsh and Vidushi never held legal title to the Watermill properties, they could not be holding the properties in trust for the Appellant.\nVI. ANALYSIS: [28] The relevant statutory framework is primarily set out in subsection 256.2(3) of the Act, under the heading, \u201cRebate in respect of land and building for residential rental accommodation\u201d. Subparagraph 256.2(3)(a)(I) provides, (with underlining added for emphasis) in abbreviated form:\nRebate in respect of land and building for residential rental accommodation\n(3) If\n(a) a particular person, other than a cooperative housing corporation,\n(i) is the recipient of a taxable supply by way of sale...from another person of a residential complex or of an interest in a residential complex and is not a builder of the complex, or \u2026\nthe Minister shall,\u2026, pay a rebate to the person \u2026\n[29] In determining whether the Appellant was a \u201crecipient\u201d, it should be noted that the term is defined at section 123 of the Act. Clause (a) of that definition provides:\nRecipient of a supply or property or a service means\nwhere consideration for the supply is payable under an agreement for the supply, the person who is liable under the agreement to pay that consideration...;\n[30] Based upon the wording of the legislation set out above, it was Satish, Adarsh and Vidushi who signed the purchase and sale agreement, obliging them to pay the purchase prices for the Watermill properties. They were therefore the recipients of the supply. As such, the Appellant does not qualify for the rebate.\n[31] Of course, the above analysis does not consider the Appellant\u2019s argument concerning the role that the trust agreement between itself and Satish, Adarsh and Vidushi should play as part of the analysis.\n[32] The Federal Court of Appeal, in the Cheema[1] case has considered an argument very similar to the one put forth by the Appellant dealing with the use of trusts. It is worth setting out the facts and conclusion set out in Cheema in my analysis.\n[33] In Cheema, the Appellant and his friend, Dr. Akbari, signed an agreement of purchase and sale providing for the construction of a house in Vaughan, Ontario. While the house was for Mr. Cheema and his family, Dr. Akbari signed the purchase and sale agreement only to help Mr. Cheema obtain mortgage financing. Dr. Akbari did not pay any part of the purchase price, nor for any of the ongoing expenses related to the house.\n[34] At closing, Mr. Cheema and his spouse acquired 99% interest in the house and Dr. Akbari acquired a 1% interest. On the same day, Dr. Akbari signed a trust declaration acknowledging that he was holding this 1% interest in trust for Mr. Cheema and his spouse. This trust declaration was not provided to the mortgage lender, and probably not provided to the builder.\n[35] Dr. Akbari later transferred his 1% interest to Mr. Cheema\u2019s son, who had been approved by the mortgagee.[2] Mr. Cheema and his spouse moved into the house as their primary place of residence immediately after closing.\n[36] The Minister denied Mr. Cheema the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate on the basis that Dr. Akbari was not the \u201cparticular individual\u201d for purposes of subsection 254(2) of the Act.[3] Dr. Akbari, who is not related to Mr. Cheema, signed the agreement of purchase and sale for the home in question, but did not intend to occupy the home.[4]\n[37] In order to qualify for the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate under section 254 of the Act, seven conditions, set out in paragraphs 254(2)(a) through (g) of the Act, must be satisfied. The main criteria in issue in the Cheema decision is found in paragraph 254(2)(b), summarized below:\nparagraph 254(2)(b): at the time the particular individual assumes liability under the agreement of purchase and sale of the complex, the particular individual must be \u201cacquiring the complex...for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual\u201d;\nMajority: Stratas J.A., and Nadon J.A.[5] [38] At the FCA, the majority of the Court found that Mr. Cheema was not entitled to the New Housing Rebate because the requirement in paragraph 254(2)(b) was not met. Because the supply of the complex was made to multiple individuals, the references to \u201ca particular individual\u201d must be read as references to all of those individuals as a group (see ss. 262(3) of the Act). When Mr. Cheema and Dr. Akbari assumed liability under the agreement of purchase and sale, only Mr. Cheema was acquiring the residential complex as a primary place of residence. Dr. Akbari never intended to occupy the complex as his primary residence. The fact that Dr. Akbari acquired the residential complex only as a trustee was found to be of no consequence as the agreement of purchase and sale does not distinguish between Dr. Akbari and Mr. Cheema as purchasers, nor does section 254 provide any exception for trustees.\n[39] The trust arrangement between Mr. Cheema and Dr. Akbari was found to be extraneous to paragraph 254(2)(b) of the Act because subsection 254(2)(b) does not distinguish between beneficial and legal ownership. Rather, paragraph 254(2)(b) focuses on the individual who was legally liable to the builder under the agreement of purchase and sale. In order for any purchaser to receive the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate, all purchasers must meet the criteria under paragraph 254(2)(b) of the Act, and intend to occupy the complex as their primary residence.\n[40] Of assistance in this matter, the Court wrote, \u201cIt is the relationship of the person acquiring the complex to the builder -one of purchase and sale- that is relevant, not the relationship between co-purchasers.\u201d[6]\n[41] The Appellant, as part of their submissions, urged the Court to rely upon the dissent of Justice Webb in Cheema.\n[42] In his dissent, Justice Webb wrote that Mr. Cheema should be entitled to the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate because he was the only person who acquired a beneficial interest in the property from the builder, for purposes of subsection 254(2) of the Act.[7] He concluded that if a person has signed an agreement of purchase and sale but has not acquired a beneficial interest in the residential complex, that person is not a particular individual for the purposes of subsection 254(2) of the Act. Since Dr. Akbari did not acquire a beneficial interest in the residential complex, Dr. Akbari\u2019s was not a particular individual, and there was no supply by way of sale of a residential complex to Dr. Akbari. Dr. Akbari 1% acquisition of the house as bare trustee should be ignored for the purposes of paragraph 254(2).\n[43] Returning now to the matter before me, as stated, the issue is whether the Appellant is entitled to the NRRPR.\n[44] While the issue in Cheema was whether the taxpayer was eligible for the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate under section 254, the principles in Cheema still assist me in deciding this appeal. Based on both Cheema and the wording found in paragraph 256.2(3)(a) of the Act, the Appellant is not the recipient of the supplies of the Watermill properties, and as such, is not entitled to the NRRPR. Similar to section 254, subsection 256.2(3)(a) does not distinguish between beneficial and legal ownership, so it is of no consequence that the three related individuals acquired the Subject Properties as bare trustees of the Appellant. Paragraph 256.2(3)(a) required the Appellant to have acquired the Subject Properties (i.e., acquired legal title by signing the purchase and sale agreements) to claim the NRRPR.\n[45] Similar to the Cheema decision, it is the relationship between the purchaser and the seller that is relevant to the entitlement to the NRRPR rebate, not the relationship between the co-purchasers.\n[46] Since the Appellant was not the recipient (as defined in the Act) of the Watermill properties, the Appellant unfortunately does not meet the requirements of ss. 256.2(3)(a) of the Act. The Appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 17th day of May 2023.\n\u201cR.

Introduction [1] With the assistance of Fiscal Arbitrators tax preparers, Darren Jamieson claimed almost $400,000 in fictitious business losses to obtain refunds of tax already withheld from his employment income in 2009 and previous taxation years.\n[2] The Minister of National Revenue disallowed the claimed fictitious business losses and assessed Mr. Jamieson a penalty under subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act for the false information contained in his income tax return. In the present appeal, the Respondent bears the burden of establishing that the Minister correctly assessed that penalty.\n[3] After considering the facts and evidence presented, I have determined that Mr. Jamieson is liable for the penalty because he was wilfully blind to the false statements in his income tax return. Applying the framework identified by this Court in Torres,[1] the determinative factors in this case are the blatantness of the false statements and the incomprehensible explanations provided by his tax preparers. Mr. Jamieson had sufficient education and experience to heed the warning signs that further, independent inquiries were necessary before signing and filing his income tax return.\nII. Analysis - Wilful blindness under the Torres framework [4] The only issue in this appeal is whether Mr. Jamieson knowingly, or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made false statements in his 2009 income tax return. That knowledge can be imputed by wilful blindness, where a taxpayer turns a blind eye to the truth and accuracy of statements in their return.[2]\n[5] Mr. Jamieson was forthcoming in his testimony, and acknowledged that his income tax return contained false statements. However, his evidence was not consistently credible or reliable. He could not explain why he ignored the significant warning signs of the blatant false statements in his income tax return, based on an \u201calternative tax filing method\u201d that made little sense.\nEducation and experience\n[6] Mr. Jamieson had sufficient education and experience to recognize the false statements and understand that further inquiries were necessary.\n[7] He obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Commerce from the University of Windsor in 1994. Shortly thereafter, he began his career with Ford Motor Company as a contract Production Supervisor, then moved on to the position of Maintenance Supervisor. He was promoted to Maintenance Manager in 2002, and held that position for ten years.\n[8] As supervisor, Mr. Jamieson was responsible for approximately seven to twelve employees. As manager, he was responsible for three shift supervisors and their employees. His responsibilities included ensuring that these groups worked within a given budget.\n[9] Mr. Jamieson understood business concepts, including profit and loss. Despite his knowledge and experience, he ignored the clear warning signs of the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method.\nThe blatantness of the false statements\n[10] Mr. Jamieson signed his income tax return, with attached Statement of Business or Professional Activities and Request for Loss Carryback forms, containing the following significant and blatant false statements:\n(i)gross business income of $135,537.77 income from \u201cRECEIPTS AS AGENT\u201d;\n(ii)total business expenses of $534,801.89 from \u201cAMT TO PRINCIPAL FR AGENT\u201d expenses;\n(iii)a net business loss of $399,264.12; and\n(iv)a loss of $284,401.60 as total income.\n[11] He signed the income tax return, even though he had never operated a business.\n[12] Mr. Jamieson recalled looking through his income tax return and asking questions about the numbers that were there, but he was satisfied by his contact\u2019s responses that it was part of the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method. He further stated that he believed he understood those numbers at the time.\nIncomprehensible explanations from tax preparers\n[13] Mr. Jamieson outlined how he became involved with his tax preparers and the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method. A colleague introduced him to Bruce Blair, a former Ford Motor Company employee, who left to work with his brother, Roger Blair, at DSC Lifestyle Services (\u201cDSC\u201d).\n[14] Mr. Jamieson was unhappy with his investments and his interest was piqued by Bruce Blair\u2019s presentation on \u201ccash flow liquidity\u201d. He subsequently attended five or six DSC educational meetings and joined the membership to gain access to various investment vehicles.\n[15] DSC also introduced Mr. Jamieson to Fiscal Arbitrators in late 2009. Mr. Jamieson attended a couple of Fiscal Arbitrators presentations before signing on to the filing method.\n[16] He signed a document called \u201cApplication and Agreement (Alternative Tax Filing Educational Information)\u201d on November 27, 2009. Although this document referred to \u201ccustomized educational information, materials, products or services which show alternative tax filing methods\u201d, Mr. Jamieson did not provide the Court with any supporting documentation.\n[17] More importantly, Mr. Jamieson\u2019s explanation for the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method made little sense. He provided the following descriptions at various times during his cross-examination:\n\u2026 So the way it was explained to us was this tax model was a reciprocal relationship whereby the taxpayer could recover -- use this filing process to recover -- pay taxes over the four-year period to unlock cash in over short-term debt obligations or investments, but at a future date, it would have to be repaid back to the government.\n\u2026\nThis was an article -- it was explained to us that it was an article in the Tax Code that could be used to unlock or get back previous years\u2019 tax income on a short-term basis that would have to be paid back at a later date, almost like -- well I guess you could call it an industry loan back to yourself on your tax money you\u2019d already paid to the government. That was how they -- but they made it clear that at some point, you would have to pay it back.\n\u2026\nSo with the way our membership sold us was we would unlock our previous years\u2019 tax dollars and we would use that in investment vehicles, create liquidity and cash flow, and then once we -- you know, assuming those were successful, one way or the other, you\u2019d have to pay the government back in previous tax filings -- or sorry, in future year tax filing.\n\u2026\nNo, I mean, yeah, they said -- they said, basically, you know, through the -- your filing process, you\u2019re basically applying for this ability to get your income tax back, but you had to -- based on your income, your age, the amount of dependents you have in your family, that you had to qualify for. So this was a process where you filed -- if you qualified for it, you would get that income tax back. And then you could go back to future years at some point to also apply for that income tax back, but you could use that money for income strategies or short-term debt obligations, but ultimately you would have to pay it back. That\u2019s the way it was explained to us.\n[18] Ultimately, he used the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method to obtain a tax refund of $33,000, to \u201cunlock it as a cashflow strategy to be paid back at a later date.\u201d In doing so, he ignored basic accounting principles and common sense.\nFailure to make proper inquiries\n[19] Mr. Jamieson stated that he told his father and former tax preparer about the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method. Unsurprisingly, he was unable to explain it in a way that they could understand. I agree with counsel for the Respondent that this constituted a red flag.\n[20] Despite the difficulties in understanding and explaining the method, Mr. Jamieson did not contact the Canada Revenue Agency to verify that the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method was in fact based on existing tax provisions. Furthermore, although Mr. Jamieson stated that he received a copy of the \u201cTax Code article\u201d in question, he did not show it to a lawyer or an accountant.\n[21] Counsel for Mr. Jamieson argued that his client was convinced by the quality sales pitch, made over the course of several meetings and presentations.\n[22] I do not accept that submission. Regardless of how convincing the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method may have been at the outset, what Mr. Jamieson described has no relationship to the false statements in his 2009 income tax return.\n[23] His return does not refer to any government loan program related to taxes already paid. It did not include supporting documentation or forms with respect to any CRA-endorsed program that would allow Mr. Jamieson to borrow against taxes he already paid in 2009 and previous years. Instead, the return referred to a fictitious business, with fictitious income and fictitious losses.\n[24] Mr. Jamieson should have consulted with third parties to determine whether the application of the Fiscal Arbitrators filing method in his 2009 income tax return was valid or accurate. However, he failed to discuss the specific information in his return with accounting or tax professionals, or the CRA.\n[25] His conversations with his father and former tax preparer were not sufficient inquiries. They were not tax professionals,[3] and more importantly, he did not provide them with any written materials to allow them to properly assess the filing method.\n[26] Mr. Jamieson chose not to meaningfully consult tax professionals or the CRA because he did not want to know the truth.\nIII. Conclusion [27] Mr. Jamieson is liable for the penalty because he had the knowledge, experience, and resources to know that he was making false statements in filing his 2009 income tax return. He chose to ignore significant warning signs because his objective was to make money through the \u201ccash back process\u201d promoted by Fiscal Arbitrators. In doing so, he disregarded his obligations under our self-assessing tax system.\n[28] The appeal is therefore dismissed, with costs payable to the Respondent in accordance with the Tariff.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 18th day of May 2023.\n\u201cJoanna Hill\u201d\nHill J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 69\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2012-3804(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDARREN JAMIESON v.

Graham\u201d\nGraham J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 70\nDate: 20230517\nDocket: 2019-1307(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nBRANDON OSADCHUK,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nGraham J.\n[1] The Appellant based his entire appeal on the type of organized pseudolegal commercial arguments described in Meads v. Meads (2012 ABQB 571).\n[2] I struck the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal and answer in their entirety. I gave the Appellant the chance to convince me why I should allow him to file an amended notice of appeal. I warned the Appellant that if he did not comply with my order, I would dismiss his appeal. He did not comply. Accordingly, I am dismissing his appeal.\nI. Background [3] The Appellant participated in a charitable donation scheme known variously as Canadians Care or Trinity Global. He claimed to have made a charitable donation of $37,486 in his 2008 tax year. The Minister of National Revenue reassessed the Appellant to deny the donation. The Appellant appealed that reassessment.\n[4] I am the case management judge for the Trinity Global group of appeals. In that role, I reviewed the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal and answer.\nII. The Appellant\u2019s Pleadings [5] The Appellant\u2019s pleadings are a classic example of the type of pleadings used by organized pseudolegal commercial argument litigants:\n(a)When spelling his name, the Appellant uses unusual punctuation and avoids capital letters. He spells it \u201cbrandon: osadchuk\u201d.\n(b)The Appellant argues that he is not a \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the Income Tax Act based on the nonsensical assertion that human beings are not people.\n(c)The Appellant attaches a birth certificate to the answer and asserts that it \u201cproves without question that [he is] in [his] capacity as a human being\u201d. He continues and states, \u201cI have waived my right and refuse to be recognized as a legal person before the law, and claim my right to be recognized as a human being before the law.\u201d\n(d)The Appellant refers to documents being \u201csigned in wet ink\u201d.\n(e)There are repeated references to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Clearly, referring to these documents does not make one an organized pseudolegal commercial argument litigant. However, asserting that these documents prevent human beings from being taxed under the Income Tax Act certainly does.\n(f)The answer places great emphasis on what the Appellant understands to be a distinction between \u201cthe inherent side of the Tax Court of Canada\u201d and its \u201cstatutory side\u201d.\n(g)The Appellant seeks repayment of all income tax, CPP and EI that he has ever paid. He also seeks an order that he not have to pay tax in the future.\n[6] Ultimately, the only reference to the Trinity Global donation scheme in the 15 pages of pleadings is a single line at the end of the notice of appeal which states \u201cThe amount in dispute for the 2008 Canadians Care PROGRAM is $37,486\u201d and a statement at the beginning of the answer that the Appellant filed an appeal \u201cin respect to the 2008 Canadians Care Donation Program\u201d.\n[7] Neither the notice of appeal nor the answer state any material facts regarding the donation scheme, rely on any statutory provisions to dispute the donation scheme or raise an argument in respect of the donation scheme.\nIII. Striking Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument Pleadings [8] Section 53 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) states that this Court may, on its own initiative, strike out all or part of a pleading with or without leave to amend on the basis that it is an abuse of the process of the Court or that it discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal.\n[9] If a taxpayer files a notice of appeal that is clearly based on organized pseudolegal commercial arguments, the Court should consider whether it is appropriate for the Court to strike those arguments from the notice of appeal on its own initiative. To do that, the Court must first determine at what stage in the process the arguments arose. The Court may not be able to make that determination until after the Respondent has filed a reply.\nArguments that formed the basis of how the taxpayer reported his or her income\n[10] If the organized pseudolegal commercial arguments formed the basis of how the taxpayer reported his or her income, then it would generally be inappropriate for the Court to strike the arguments from the notice of appeal on its own initiative. The Court should leave it to the Respondent to bring a motion to strike as the Respondent may, in fact, want the notice of appeal to remain intact. For example, if the Minister has imposed penalties under subsection 163(2), the Respondent may be relying on the taxpayer\u2019s ludicrous arguments to support the imposition of those penalties.\nArguments used to defend against an assessment or reassessment\n[11] If, however, the organized pseudolegal commercial arguments are something that the taxpayer has raised for the first time in response to an assessment or reassessment, then it would be entirely appropriate for the Court to strike the arguments from the pleadings on its own initiative.[1]\n[12] In that circumstance, asking a taxpayer to make submissions as to why the organized pseudolegal commercial arguments should not be struck from the notice of appeal would be a waste of judicial resources. Asking the Respondent to make submissions as to why such arguments should be struck would be a similar waste of the Respondent\u2019s time. It is plain and obvious that such arguments have no merit. Nothing an organized pseudolegal commercial argument litigant says will change that.\n[13] As long as the Court gives the taxpayer a chance to file an amended notice of appeal that raises legitimate arguments, the taxpayer will have received due process. The taxpayer will not have been deprived of his or her right to appeal, only of an opportunity to spew more nonsense.\nIV. Striking the Appellant\u2019s Pleadings [14] I reviewed the Appellant\u2019s pleadings in my role as case management judge. It was plain and obvious to me that the notice of appeal and answer were both an abuse of this Court\u2019s process and disclosed no reasonable grounds for appeal. The arguments raised therein had been considered and rejected numerous times by this Court for the simple reason that they are nonsensical gibberish and completely without merit.\n[15] The Appellant did not rely on those arguments to file his return, but rather raised them as a defence when he was reassessed to deny the charitable donations he had claimed.\n[16] It would have been a waste of judicial resources and an abuse of this Court\u2019s process to allow the appeal to continue based on the issues raised in the notice of appeal and the answer.\n[17] Accordingly, by order dated February 10, 2023, I struck the notice of appeal and answer in their entirety and gave the Appellant until April 14, 2023 to file a written argument which explained why I should grant him leave to amend the notice of appeal. I ordered the Appellant to attach a proposed amended notice of appeal to his argument.\n[18] I specifically ordered that the proposed amended notice of appeal:\n(a)not raise any arguments currently raised in the notice of appeal or the answer;\n(b)not question whether the Appellant is a \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the Income Tax Act; and\n(c)not request any relief other than that the reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2008 tax year be sent back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment and that costs be awarded to the Appellant and, for greater certainty, not seek relief in the form of:\n(i)damages;\n(ii)apology letters;\n(iii)relief from future income tax, CPP or employment insurance payments; or\n(iv)the return of previous contributions allegedly taken from the Appellant by \u201cthreat of force and or coercion\u201d.\n[19] I warned the Appellant that, if he failed to file a written argument and proposed amended notice of appeal by the deadline or filed a proposed amended notice of appeal that did not comply with my order, I would dismiss his appeal.\nV. Appellant\u2019s Argument [20] The Appellant filed a written argument by the deadline. Contrary to my order, he did not attach a proposed amended notice of appeal.\n[21] The Appellant demonstrated the obstinacy commonly seen in organized pseudolegal commercial argument litigants. Rather than using his written argument to explain why he should be given a chance to file an amended notice of appeal dealing with the Trinity Global donation scheme, he instead doubled down on his arguments regarding the Court\u2019s supposed \u201cinherent side\u201d and his not being a person.\n[22] For good measure, he also asserted that if the Court \u201ccontinues to keep this case in its statutory jurisdiction, [he] will claim Habeas Corpus and challenge the jurisdiction of the court and under which these alleged charges are brought against [him].\u201d A misunderstood reliance on habeas corpus is another common organized pseudolegal commercial argument.\nVI. Inherent Jurisdiction vs. Implied Jurisdiction [23] Despite the Appellant\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the Tax Court of Canada does not actually have any inherent jurisdiction. It is purely a statutory court. While, in the past, some have referred to the Court having the inherent jurisdiction to control its own process, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently made it clear that what the Court has is the implied jurisdiction to do so.[2]\n[24] Ironically, it is that implied jurisdiction that allows the Court to dismiss appeals where taxpayers, such as the Appellant, are abusing the Court\u2019s process by obstinately making nonsensical arguments and ignoring the Court\u2019s orders. That is exactly what I am going to do.\n[25] I gave the Appellant a chance to correct the error of his ways. He chose to not to take it. He did not even attempt to explain why he should be given leave to amend his notice of appeal let alone attach the required proposed amended notice of appeal.\n[26] The Appellant\u2019s written argument makes it clear that he has no intention of either following this Court\u2019s orders or focusing his appeal on the denial of the purported charitable donations that gave rise to the reassessment of his 2008 tax year.\nVII. Previous Decisions [27] This is not the Appellant\u2019s first time raising these same organized pseudolegal commercial arguments before this Court.\n[28] When I issued my February 10, 2023 order striking the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal, I was aware that the Appellant had another matter before the Court. Deputy Judge Jorr\u00e9 had just issued an order setting the Appellant\u2019s application for extension of time to appeal a reassessment of his 2007 tax year down for hearing.[3]\n[29] The proposed notice of appeal in that application contained the same nonsensical gibberish that the Appellant has used in this appeal. For some reason, the Respondent had consented to the extension of time. The application came before Deputy Judge Jorr\u00e9 in his role as duty judge. He refused to grant the extension because \u201c[o]n its face, the proposed notice of appeal\u2026appears to be without merit and does not demonstrate reasonable grounds for the appeal.\u201d He ordered that the application be set down for hearing.\n[30] I recently became aware that the Appellant had also used the same ridiculous arguments to appeal his 2009 and 2010 tax years and that, in an unpublished oral decision, Justice Hogan had struck the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal without leave to amend.[4] I learned this because, as I was finalizing these reasons, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the Appellant\u2019s appeal of Justice Hogan\u2019s decision.[5]\n[31] A search of the Tax Court\u2019s registry also reveals that, on December 20, 2022, the Appellant attempted to file another notice of appeal of his 2007, 2009 and 2010 tax years despite the fact that he already had an application for extension of time to appeal in process for his 2007 tax year and an appeal of his 2009 and 2010 tax years before the Federal Court of Appeal. The Registry rightly rejected the filing.\n[32] If the Appellant learns from the Federal Court of Appeal decision, Justice Hogan\u2019s decision, Deputy Judge Jorr\u00e9\u2019s order and my decision, he will stop filing meritless appeals in this Court. He will also prepare a proper notice of appeal for his application for extension of time to appeal - one that does not rely on organized pseudolegal commercial arguments.\n[33] If the Appellant fails to heed these warnings, he may find that his application for extension of time is denied and that costs are awarded against him.\nVIII. Conclusion [34] The Appellant has taken up more than enough of the Court\u2019s resources and patience. His appeal is dismissed.\n[35] Costs are awarded to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 17th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

CONTEXT\n[5] The Appellant appeals from reassessments made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under the Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985, c.-1 (5th Supp.), (the \u201cAct\u201d)) with respect to its taxation years which ended on December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017.\n[6] By notices dated June 20, 2020, the Minister reassessed the Appellant to add unreported income totalling $17,232,046 for the taxation year ended December 31, 2012, $15,131,666 for the taxation year ended December 31, 2013, $27,778,318 for the taxation year ended December 31, 2014, and $28,997,389 for the taxation year ended December 31, 2015, and assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act for these years. The Minister also disallowed additions to the Appellant\u2019s cumulative eligible capital account and deductions claimed by the Appellant with respect to capital cost allowance and interest expenses. The Minister, consequently, reduced non-capital loss balance and denied the Appellant\u2019s requests for loss carry forward. Further, another issue raised by the reassessments is whether the Minister was allowed to reassess the Appellant outside the normal reassessment period for the taxation years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\n[7] The Reply contains an overview of the matter and reads as follows (pp.1-2):\nIn its 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years the appellant sold and implemented a tax plan that enabled its customers to sell assets without paying tax on the proceeds of disposition received from the sales. The tax plan involved a series of transactions, ending with the allocation of purported losses from a sham partnership to offset the gains received from the asset sale. The appellant received a fee from its customers for the services it provided, which the appellant did not report as income. Instead of reporting the fees as income, the appellant purported to borrow money from certain corporations that it used to sell its customers\u2019 assets when implementing the tax plans. The amount of the purported loan was equal to the appellant\u2019s fee for selling and implementing the tax plan. In connection with the purported loan, the appellant issued purported promissory notes in favour of the lender. These promissory notes were shams that were created to mislead the Minister of National Revenue into believing that the appellant had received loan proceeds when in reality, the amounts were the appellant\u2019s unreported income earned from selling and implementing the tax plans.\nAdditionally, in the 2012 taxation year, the appellant purchased assets from 4092325 Investment Ltd. Specifically, the appellant purchased 4092325 Investment Ltd.\u2019s unbilled revenues as work-in-progress for significantly less than fair market value, and did not include those revenues in computing its income for the 2012 taxation year. The appellant also purchased 4092325 Investment Ltd.\u2019s other business assets. The appellant purported to pay for these assets by issuing two purported promissory notes. These notes were shams created to fabricate tax attributes, specifically, inflated capital cost allowance and cumulative eligible capital expenditures. The appellant deducted interest purportedly payable on the sham notes.\nAs a result of its grossly under-reported income and the deductions for interest, inflated capital cost allowance and eligible capital expenditures, the appellant claimed substantial non-capital losses in the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years, to which it was not entitled. At all material times, the appellant\u2019s non-capital loss balance was nil, and accordingly the appellant was not entitled to the loss carry-forwards it claimed in the 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\n[8] According to the Appellant, the promissory notes it issued created a valid creditor-debtor relationship. It then follows that the principal amount of these promissory notes should not be included in the computation of the income of the Appellant. Further, the Appellant is entitled to claim non-capital loss carry forward, interest expenses deduction, capital cost allowance and addition to its cumulative eligible capital account. Finally, penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act should be vacated.\n[9] This appeal is at an early stage. There has not yet been any exchange of lists of documents or discovery examinations.\nIV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n[10] According to the Appellant, the Reply has the following defects: law disguised as assumptions of facts, improper inclusion of evidence, immaterial facts, disclosure of confidential information and is vague, repetitive, ambiguous and misleading. The numerous deficiencies undermine the parties\u2019 ability to proceed to a hearing of the appeal in a timely and orderly fashion. The Reply is also scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and constitutes an abuse of the Court\u2019s process prohibited by section 53 of the Rules. According to the Appellant, due to the numerous defects of the Reply, the only appropriate remedy and sanction for the judicial time and Appellant\u2019s resources that are lost over this remarkably defective pleading is for this Court to strike the Reply in its entirety, without leave to amend, and to allow the Appeal.\n[11] According to the Respondent, while the Reply is partially defective, the defects are not as numerous as contended by the Appellant. The Reply can be cured by amendments, and thus, the Reply should not be struck.\nV. ANALYSIS\n5.1 Applicable principles\nA. Rules of pleadings\n[12] The purpose of pleadings is \u201cto define the issues in dispute between the parties for the purposes of production, discovery and trial\u201d (see Zelinski v. R (2002) DTC 1204, [2002] 1 CTC 2422, at para 4 (aff\u2019d 2002 FCA 330) [Zelinski]; see also Beima v. The Queen, 2016 FCA 205, at para 17 and Husky Oil Operations Limited v. The Queen, 2019 TCC 136 [Husky Oil], at para 11).\n[13] Pleadings should contain a concise statement of the material facts a party relies on.\n[14] As explained by this Court in Zelinski (paras 4 \u2013 5):\nMaterial facts are those facts which, if established at the trial, will tend to show that the party pleading is entitled to the relief sought.\nThe applicable principle is stated in Holmsted and Watson:\nThis is the rule of pleading: all of the other pleading rules are essentially corollaries or qualifications to this basic rule that the pleader must state the material facts relied upon for his or her claim or defence. The rule involves four separate elements: (1) every pleading must state facts, not mere conclusions of law; (2) it must state material facts and not include facts which are immaterial; (3) it must state facts and not the evidence by which they are to be proved; (4) it must state facts concisely in a summary form.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[15] Pleadings should be concise. Repetition should be avoided, as pleadings should only contain material facts relied upon for a claim or defense, which provide an overview of the case (Strother v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 251 [Strother], at paras 39-40).\n[16] It is also important that pleadings be balanced and that there must be a sense of fairness in the pleadings (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 568 [CIBC, TCC], at para 38).\n[17] Subsection 49(1) of the Rules provides the requirements as to what a reply should state and reads as follows:\n49(1) Subject to subsection (1.1), every reply shall state\n(a) the facts that are admitted,\n(b) the facts that are denied,\n(c) the facts of which the respondent has no knowledge and puts in issue,\n(d) the findings or assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment,\n(e) any other material fact,\n(f) the issues to be decided,\n(g) the statutory provisions relied on,\n(h) the reasons the respondent intends to rely on, and\n(i) the relief sought.\n49 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (1.1), la r\u00e9ponse indique :\na) les faits admis;\nb) les faits ni\u00e9s;\nc) les faits que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne conna\u00eet pas et qu\u2019elle n\u2019admet pas;\nd) les conclusions ou les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait sur lesquelles le ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 en \u00e9tablissant sa cotisation;\ne) tout autre fait pertinent;\nf) les points en litige;\ng) les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives invoqu\u00e9es;\nh) les moyens sur lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9e entend se fonder;\ni) les conclusions recherch\u00e9es.\n[18] The facts referred to in paragraphs 49(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules are the facts set out in a particular notice of appeal (see Husky Oil, at para 8). When the respondent admits or denies a fact (paragraphs 49(1)(a) and (b) of the Rules), it should not add comments or other conclusion of law (Strother, at para 16 and Xu v. R, 2006 TCC 695 [Xu], at para 5).\n[19] More recently, the Court reviewed these principles (see Husky Oil, at paras 20-21):\n-the respondent must admit only those facts alleged by the appellant;\n-the admission must stand alone without the respondent\u2019s own allegations relating to the subject;\n-it is inappropriate in a reply to purport to admit certain facts when those fact were not alleged in the notice of appeal; and\n-it is not permissible in the reply, when purporting to admit the particular fact, to interpret an imprecise word by substituting some other word for it.\n[20] Once the respondent has denied or admitted a fact, or has stated that it had no knowledge of a fact, there are only two more statements of facts to be pleaded by the respondent: the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment (para 49(1)(d) of the Rules) and any other material facts (para 49(1)(e) of the Rules).\n[21] As stated by this Court in Strother:\n[15]\u2026 All these statements of fact are to be statements of material fact, not immaterial facts, not statements or principles of law and not statements mixing fact with law. Subparagraphs f), g) and h) of Rule 49 accord the respondent opportunity to describe the issues, state the statutory provisions in play and submit the reasons she is relying on in this appeal.\nB. Striking of a pleading\n[22] The Rules specifically provide at Section 53 for the striking out of pleadings. The Court may strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading on the ground that the pleading may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal, is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, is an abuse of the process of the Court or discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal. Section 53 of the Rules sets out a high standard for striking out pleadings or part of pleadings. It reads as follows:\n53 (1) The Court may, on its own initiative or on application by a party, strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document,\n(a) may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal;\n(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;\n(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court; or\n(d) discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal or opposing the appeal.\n53 (1) La Cour peut, de son propre chef ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, radier un acte de proc\u00e9dure ou tout autre document ou en supprimer des passages, en tout ou en partie, avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier parce que l\u2019acte ou le document:\n(a) peut compromettre ou retarder l\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable de l\u2019appel;\n(b) est scandaleux, frivole ou vexatoire;\n(c) constitue un recours abusif \u00e0 la Cour;\n(d) ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucun moyen raisonnable d\u2019appel ou de contestation de l\u2019appel.\n[23] In Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corporation v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 742, [Sentinel Hill], the Court propounded the well-established principles to be applied in a motion to strike under section 53 of the Rules:\n[4] \u2026 There are many cases in which the matter has been considered both in this court and the Federal Court of Appeal. It is not necessary to quote from them all as the principles are well established.\n(a) The facts as alleged in the impugned pleading must be taken as true subject to the limitations stated in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. Canada, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at 455. It is not open to a party attacking a pleading under Rule 53 to challenge assertions of fact.\n(b) To strike out a pleading or part of a pleading under Rule 53 it must be plain and obvious that the position has no hope of succeeding. The test is a stringent one and the power to strike out a pleading must be exercised with great care.\n(c) A motions judge should avoid usurping the function of the trial judge in making determinations of fact or relevancy. Such matters should be left to the judge who hears the evidence.\n[24] The test to be applied for the striking out of pleadings or parts of pleadings is whether it is plain and obvious that it discloses no reasonable claim (Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, at para 3).\n[25] In the context of a motion to strike a reply in an income tax appeal, the motion will be granted only if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts as pleaded in the reply are true, that the reply fails to state a reasonable basis for concluding that the reassessment under appeal is correct (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. R, 2013 FCA 122 [CIBC, FCA], at para 7).\n[26] More recently, the Federal Court of Appeal in Ereiser v. Canada, 2013 FCA 20, reviewed those principles:\n[17] There is no dispute as to the test for striking pleadings. It was recently restated by Chief Justice McLachlin, writing for the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 at paragraph 17:\n... A claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action: Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 15; Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 980. Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial: see, generally, Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83; Odhavji Estate; Hunt; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735.\n\u2026\n[27] A pleading may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal, if it is plain and obvious that the alleged pleading is irrelevant to the issues to be resolved.\n[28] It has also been held that pleadings which state irrelevant and improper facts or are so deficient in material facts that they do not raise a ground of appeal can be struck on the ground that they would prejudice the fair hearing of the appeal (Gauthier v. R, 2006 TCC 290). As stated in Heron v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 71 (aff\u2019d in 2017 FCA 229):\n[12] When a party states that the allegation is not relevant, the \u201cirrelevancy must be quite clear and, so to speak, apparent at the first glance. It is not enough that on considerable argument it may appear that they do not afford a defence.\u201d\n[29] A pleading will be considered frivolous or vexatious when \u201cit was so deficient that the defendant could not know how to answer the claim. As well, the Court would be unable to regulate or manage the proceeding\u201d (Simon v. Canada, 2011 FCA 6 [Simon], at para 9). It should be reserved for the plainest and most egregiously senseless assertions (Sentinel Hill, at para 11).\n[30] Pleadings may also be struck if \u201c\u2026they were inserted for colour, or simply as they are inflammatory\u201d (Mudge v. R, 2020 TCC 77 [Mudge], at para 20). Furthermore, a pleading will be considered frivolous if, assuming the facts to be true, it is plain and obvious that it cannot succeed (Canada v. Roitman, 2006 FCA 266, at para 15).\n[31] A pleading may be considered an abuse of the Court\u2019s process when it is unfair to a party or would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Toronto City v. CUPE Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, at paras 35-45). As stated by this Court in Marine Atlantic Inc. v. R, 2016 TCC 46:\n[47] In order for a party\u2019s conduct to amount to an abuse of process, the party must have deliberately failed to cooperate or comply with the rules or court orders causing delay and prejudice. In Yacyshyn v. Canada, [1999] 1 CTC 139 (FCA), the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed this Court\u2019s order to strike pleadings is based on the taxpayer\u2019s conduct, which in that case had caused \u201cdelay and prejudice\u201d amounting to an abuse of process.\n[32] However, as stated by this Court in Promex Group Inc. v. R, [1998] 3 C.T.C. 2128, 98 DTC 1588, it is not an abuse of the Court\u2019s process to fully disclose the basis of an assessment, regardless of the source of the information on which it is based, but it could well be an abuse of the process for the Minister to withhold facts central to the making of the assessment, or to conjure up assumptions that were not in fact made (at para 32).\nC. Remedy\n[33] Improper pleadings constitute an irregularity within the meaning of Section 7 of the Rules (reproduced in Appendix A to these Reasons) and do not render a proceeding a nullity.\n[34] Where the deficiencies in a pleading are extensive, lack specificity or are vague, the proper remedy is to set the pleadings aside with leave to file a new pleading that meets the requirements set out in the Rules. As stated by this Court, it is \u201cnot about striking out poor pleadings but rather about pleadings that will materially harm the litigation process\u201d (see 935475 Ontario Ltd v. R, 2009 TCC 196, at para 34).\n[35] The Court may grant all necessary amendment or relief to secure the just determination of the real matters in dispute. To strike a pleading without leave to amend, the defect must be incurable by amendment (see Simon, at para 8). Furthermore, the Federal Court determined that for a claim to be struck without leave to amend, there must not be a \u201cscintilla\u201d of a legitimate cause for action (Riabko v. R, [1999] FCJ No 1289, 173 FTR 239 [Riabko], at para 8).\n[36] When an appellant makes a motion to strike a reply, it has the burden of showing that \u201cit would be impossible for the Respondent to amend to support the reassessment\u201d (see Mont-Bruno C. C. Inc. v. R, 2018 TCC 105, at para 29).\n[37] This burden is a heavy one. As stated by this Court in Zelinski, \u201c[a]mendments to pleadings should generally be permitted, so long as that can be done without causing prejudice to the opposing party that cannot be compensated by an award of costs or other terms, as the purpose of the Rules is to ensure, so far as possible, a fair trial of the real issues in dispute between the parties\u201d (at para 4).\n[38] Upon examining the motion, I will now apply these principles.\n5.2 Overreaching denials and admissions\nA. Positions of the parties\n[39] According to the Appellant, the Respondent uses \u201coverreaching denials\u201d and \u201coverreaching admissions\u201d in the Reply numerous times, namely at paragraphs 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and subparagraph 7.3.\n[40] Paragraphs containing the alleged overreaching denials or admissions are in the part of the Reply that shall state the facts that are admitted (para 49(1)(a) of the Rules), the facts that are denied (para 49(1)(b) of the Rules) and the facts of which the Respondent has not knowledge of and puts them at issue (para 49(1)(c) of the Rules).\n[41] At the hearing, the Respondent made some concessions as described in Appendix A to the Respondent\u2019s written representations dated November 24, 2022 (Appendix A is attached to these reasons as Appendix B).\nB. Analysis\n[42] As stated by this Court in Xu \u201c[a] defendant in civil litigation is permitted to admit only those facts alleged by a plaintiff. The admission should be a \u201cstand alone\u201d event, not clouded by the defendant\u2019s own allegations in the subject area of the admission\u201d (at para 5).\n[43] Using overreaching admissions or denials is poor and improper pleadings (Strother, at para 16), and as such, the Court should strike these parts of the Reply and allow the Respondent to amend the Reply.\nParagraphs 4, 6, and 11 and subparagraph 7.3 of the Reply\n[44] The Respondent concedes overreaching denials and admissions at paragraphs 4, 6 and 11 and subparagraph 7.3 of the Reply. Amendments to paragraphs 4, 6 and 11 and subparagraph 7.3 of the Reply as proposed by the Respondent shall be made to the Reply.\nParagraph 4 of the Reply [45] The Respondent concedes that paragraph 4 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial and proposes to amend it by deleting the second sentence containing the overreaching denial, deleting the reference to paragraph 24 of the Notice of Appeal and adding the following at the end of the first sentence: \u201cbut denies that the loans exists\u201d.\n[46] Furthermore, the Respondent proposes to add subparagraph 8.1 in the Reply to deal with paragraph 24 of the Notice of Appeal, which will then read as follows:\nWith respect to paragraph 24 of the Notice of Appeal, the Attorney General of Canada admits only that documents titled promissory notes were created to evidence some purported loans, but denies that the loans existed. The Attorney General of Canada has no knowledge of whether a promissory note was created for every purported loan to the Appellant and puts it in issue.\nParagraph 6 of the Reply [47] The Respondent concedes that paragraph 6 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial and proposes to amend paragraph 6 by deleting the second sentence containing the overreaching denial and adding the following at the end of the first sentence: \u201cbut denies that $19,768,000 was the agreed purchase price for the acquisition\u201d and by changing the words \u201cpurported agreed\u201d by the word \u201cstated\u201d.\nSubparagraph 7.3 of the Reply\n[48] The Respondent concedes that subparagraph 7.3 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial and proposes to amend subparagraph 7.3 to read as follows: \u201cdenies that the appellant paid the purchase price\u201d.\nParagraph 11 of the Reply [49] At the hearing, the Respondent conceded that paragraph 11 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching admission, because paragraph 27 of the Notice of Appeal does not allege the Appellant claimed interest of $971,999. The Respondent proposes to remove paragraph 11 of the Reply and amend paragraph 2 of the Reply to include a denial of the facts alleged in paragraph 27 of the Reply.\nParagraphs 9 and 10 of the Reply\n[50] With respect to paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Reply, for the reasons below, I find that proposed amendments by the Respondent are not sufficient to answer the defects raised by the Appellant.\nParagraph 9 of the Reply [51] According to the Appellant, paragraph 9 of the Reply contains an overreaching denial, which reads as follows: \u201c\u2026the respondent denies that the appellant incurred any of the expenses related to the additions listed\u201d, which assertions were not alleged in paragraph 25 of the Notice of Appeal. I agree with the Appellant and that part of paragraph 9 has to be deleted.\n[52] The Respondent concedes that paragraph 9 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial because paragraph 25 of the Notice of Appeal does not allege that the Appellant incurred the expenses. The Respondent conceded that an amendment should be made to paragraph 9 by deleting that part of paragraph 9 as referred to by the Appellant and adding the following: \u201c\u2026the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s position is that the appellant did not incur any of the expenses related to the additions listed\u201d.\n[53] However, the addition proposed to be made by the Respondent at the end of paragraph 9 should not be allowed. Again, as stated in Strother and Xu, it is not proper to add comments of this sort in that part of the Reply. More specifically, in Xu (at para 5), this Court stated:\nA defendant in civil litigation is permitted to admit only those facts alleged by a plaintiff. The admission should be a \u201cstand alone\u201d event, not clouded by the defendant\u2019s own allegations in the subject area of the admission.\n[54] Hence, the proposed addition at the end of paragraph 9 is not allowed.\nParagraph 10 of the Reply [55] According to the Appellant, paragraph 10 of the Reply contains an overreaching denial, which reads as follows: \u201c\u2026but, for clarity, he denies that the appellant incurred those expenses\u201d, which assertions were not alleged in paragraph 26 of the Notice of Appeal. I agree with the Appellant and that part of paragraph 10 has to be deleted.\n[56] The Respondent concedes that paragraph 10 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial because paragraph 26 of the Notice of Appeal does not allege that the Appellant incurred the expenses. The Respondent conceded that an amendment should be made to paragraph 10 by deleting that part of paragraph 10 as referred to by the Appellant and adding the following: \u201c\u2026but, for clarity, the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s position is that the appellant did not incur those expenses\u201d.\n[57] However, the proposed addition at the end of paragraph 10 is not allowed. As indicated above, it is not proper to add comments of this sort in that part of the Reply.\nParagraphs 8 and 12 of the Reply\n[58] At the hearing, the Respondent did not concede on whether paragraphs 8 or 12 contained any overreaching denials or admissions.\nParagraph 8 of the Reply [59] The Appellant is of the view that paragraph 8 of the Reply contains an overreaching admission, because the Respondent added the following after admitting the facts stated in paragraph 21 of the Notice of Appeal: \u201c\u2026but for clarity adds that the promissory notes did not create a valid debtor-creditor relationships\u201d. Paragraph 21 of the Notice of Appeal reads as follows: \u201cAs part of the Acquisition, the 409 Notes were assumed by the Appellant (the \u201cAssumption\u201d).\u201d\n[60] I find that this is improper pleading (see Strother and Xu), and accordingly, that part of paragraph 8 of the Reply should be struck.\nParagraph 12 of the Reply [61] According to the Appellant, part of paragraph 12 of the Reply constitutes an overreaching denial as it was not alleged by the Appellant. That part of paragraph 12 reads as follows: \u201cbut for clarity, denies that there were non-capital losses available for carry forward.\u201d I agree with the Appellant.\n[62] I find that that is an unnecessary comment by the Respondent which should be avoided in that part of the Reply. The corresponding paragraph of the Notice of Appeal just stated that the Appellant carried forward and deducted non-capital losses. For these reasons, that part of paragraph 12 of the Reply should be struck.\n5.3 Assumptions of mixed fact and law and conclusions of law\n[63] Assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment can be found at paragraph 27 of the Reply. Paragraph 27 of the Reply contains 126 subparagraphs, and some subparagraphs contain their own subparagraphs. Furthermore, Schedules A to F of the Reply are part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment, being referenced within paragraph 27 of the Reply.\nA. Positions of the parties\n[64] According to the Appellant, numerous assumptions of mixed fact and law and conclusions of law contained in the part of the Reply stating the assumptions of fact the Minister relied upon to make the assessment should be struck since only assumptions of fact should be included within that part of the Reply.\n[65] At the hearing, the Respondent conceded, to some extent, that various assumptions should be amended to comply with these rules.\nB. Analysis\n[66] The findings or assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment are to be stated in every reply by virtue of paragraph 49(1)(d) of the Rules.\n[67] In Canada v. Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd., 2003 FCA 294, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that in pleading findings or assumptions of fact, the Minister could not plead conclusions of law. Further, the Minister should only assume the factual components of a conclusion of mixed fact and law as she must extricate the factual components of a conclusion of mixed fact and law:\n[25] I agree that legal statements or conclusions have no place in the recitation of the Minister\u2019s factual assumptions. The implication is that the taxpayer has the onus of demolishing the legal statement or conclusion and, of course, that is not correct. The legal test to be applied is not subject to proof by the parties as if it was a fact. The parties are to make their arguments as to the legal test, but it is the Court that has the ultimate obligation of ruling on questions of law.\n[26] . . . The Minister may assume the factual components of a conclusion of mixed fact and law. However, if he wishes to do so, he should extricate the factual components that are being assumed so that the taxpayer is told exactly what factual assumptions it must demolish in order to succeed. It is unsatisfactory that the assumed facts be buried in the conclusion of mixed fact and law.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[68] More recently, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed these principles in CIBC, FCA, at para 92.\n[69] In Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 SCR 748 at para 35, 144 DLR (4th)1, the Supreme Court of Canada distinguished between questions of law, questions of fact, and questions of mixed fact and law as follows:\n. . . Briefly stated, questions of law are questions about what the correct legal test is; questions of fact are questions about what actually took place between the parties; and questions of mixed law and fact are questions about whether the facts satisfy the legal tests. A simple example will illustrate these concepts. In the law of tort, the question what \u201cnegligence\u201d means is a question of law. The question whether the defendant did this or that is a question of fact. And, once it has been decided that the applicable standard is one of negligence, the question whether the defendant satisfied the appropriate standard of care is a question of mixed law and fact. . . .\n[Emphasis added.]\n[70] In other words, \u201c[q]uestions of mixed fact and law involve applying a legal standard to a set of facts\u201d (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, at para 26).\nDealing at arm\u2019s length\n[71] At the hearing, the Respondent conceded that subparagraphs 27.65 and 27.114 contain assumptions of mixed fact and law as to whether the parties are dealing at arm\u2019s length and proposes that subparagraph 27.114 be deleted in its entirety, and subparagraph 27.65 be amended to extract the factual elements to read as follows:\n27.65 \u201cNegus, directly or indirectly, controls the Abacus Group.\n27.65.1 \u201cThe TargetCos were controlled by Negus or the Abacus Group at the time the loans in respect of the Abacus Promissory Notes were purported to have been made\u201d.\n[72] I find that subparagraphs 27.65 and 27.114 contain assumptions of mixed fact and law and should be struck from that part of the Reply. The Reply should be amended as proposed by the Respondent.\nSham\n[73] According to the Appellant, the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment contain 104 references to the effect that documents or contracts were \u201csham\u201d, which is a conclusion of law. As stated by this Court in Chad v. R, 2021 TCC 45 [Chad]:\n\u2026the factual underpinnings (such as intention to mislead) may be pleaded as facts assumed by the Minister but the mention or use of the term sham or the drawing of a legal conclusion that there was a sham should be pleaded elsewhere in the particular reply\u201d (at para 42).\n[74] Conclusions of law should not be part of the assumptions of facts made by the Minister when making the assessment. For example, Schedules B-1 to B-42, which are part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister, each contain numerous references to the word \u201csham\u201d.\n[75] At the hearing, the Respondent conceded that a finding a sham is a conclusion of law and should not be part of the assumptions of fact, and proposed to amend all assumptions, including the schedules, to strike the word \u201csham\u201d.\n[76] I find that the word \u201csham\u201d should not be part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment as it is a conclusion of law. Hence, the word \u201csham\u201d has to be struck from the assumptions of fact found at paragraph 27 of the Reply, including the Schedules.\nValid creditor\/debtor or debtor\/lender relationship\n[77] According to the Appellant, subparagraphs 27.53 and 27.94 of the Reply, which deny a \u201cvalid creditor-debtor\u201d relationship, have to be modified as that is an improper conclusion of law or mixed fact and law. The Appellant also refers to paragraph 4, subparagraph 7.3 and paragraph 8 using the same terminology.\n[78] Firstly, paragraph 4, subparagraph 7.3 and paragraph 8 are not part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment. Hence, the ground raised by the Appellant to strike part of these paragraphs because they contain improper conclusions of law or mixed fact and law cannot stand.\n[79] As for subparagraph 27.53 of the Reply, it reads as follows: \u201cNeither party had any intention to create a valid debtor-creditor relationship\u201d. I find that whether someone has a specific intention is a question of fact; accordingly, I find that subparagraph 27.53 is an assumption of fact and should not be struck from that part of the Reply.\n[80] However, subparagraph 27.94 of the Reply, which reads as follows: \u201cthe parties to the APEL Promissory Note #1 and APEL Promissory Note #2 did not have a debtor\/lender relationship\u201d is a conclusion of law, and thus should be struck from that part of the Reply.\nTransfer of property\n[81] According to the Appellant, subparagraph 27.50 is a conclusion of law. It reads as follows: \u201cThere was no transfer of property from any of the TargetCos to 409 Ltd. or the appellant in connection with the Abacus Promissory Note\u201d.\n[82] I agree with the Appellant that subparagraph 27.50 is a conclusion of law, and this subparagraph should be struck from that part of the Reply.\nFair market value\n[83] Subparagraphs 5.3, 27.103 and 28.23 refer to the fair market value of the work-in-progress sold by 4092325 Investments Ltd. to the Appellant. According to the Appellant, these paragraphs represent improper conclusions of law.\n[84] I find that assertions as to value are a finding of fact and, thus, these subparagraphs are proper and should not be struck from the Reply.\nUnreported income\n[85] The Appellant puts in issue the following assumption found in subparagraph 27.28 which reads as follows: \u201cthe appellant\u2019s unreported income [\u2026] are the appellant\u2019s fees earned in course of selling and implementing the Abacus Tax Plan\u201d. According to the Appellant, this assumption is a conclusion of law or mixed fact and law.\n[86] For the following reasons, I do not agree with the Appellant. That a taxpayer failed to include an amount in income is factual. I agree with the comments found in Xu (at paras 8 and 9) where the appellant argued that the Minister\u2019s Reply should be struck for stating that the appellant \u201cfailed to include income in the amount of\u2026\u201d. As reasoned in that case, income is not a defined term in the Act. To allege that a taxpayer should have included an amount in income but did not is not a conclusion of law. If the Court was to strike such statements that would make drafting pleadings for this Court an arduous task.\n[87] Furthermore, I also find that \u201c\u2026the purpose of payments, the business carried on \u2026, the factual connection or absence of a factual connection between the two...\u201d are also proper assumptions of fact to be made by the Minister in making the assessment (CIBC, FCA, at para 93). I therefore find that this subparagraph is proper and should not be struck from that part of the Reply.\nBona fide loan\n[88] According to the Appellant, assumptions found in subparagraphs 27.46 and 27.93 of the Reply are conclusions of law or mixed fact and law which should not be included in the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment.\n[89] Subparagraph 27.46 reads as follows: \u201cThe purported loan agreement evidenced by the Abacus Promissory Notes were not bona fide loan.\u201d\n[90] Subparagraph 27.93 of the Reply reads as follows: \u201cAPEL Promissory Note #1 and APEL Promissory Note #2 were not bona fide loans.\u201d\n[91] According to the Respondent, these assumptions are proper because to determine whether someone is of good faith is a question of fact.\n[92] The Respondent refers the Court to the Federal Court decision of Sadique v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration and N. C. Beaton, [1974] C.F. 719, where the Court stated that whether an individual is bona fide is a question of fact, and not a question of law (at page 723). Also, the Respondent refers to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Dulac v. Nadeau, [1953] 1 SCR 164 at page 172, 1953 CanLII 58, where the Supreme Court stated that whether an individual is of good faith is generally a question of fact.\n[93] However, the impugned assumptions do not refer to the good faith of an individual, but as to whether specific documents are bona fide. The question as to whether a document is bona fide or not requires one to apply the proper legal test to a specific set of facts. Hence, it is an assumption of mixed fact and law, which should not be found in the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment. The Respondent has to extricate the factual components of what is being assumed, and all references to whether documents are \u201cbona fide\u201d should be struck from that part of the Reply.\n5.4 Repetitive, colorful and vexatious language\nA. Positions of the parties\n[94] According to the Appellant, the Reply contains excessive repetitions, which undermine the goals of conciseness and certainty in pleadings (Strother, at paras. 41-43).\n[95] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, several statements in the Reply constitute nothing more than a colorful and vexatious commentary, which should not be allowed in pleadings, namely the terms \u201chiding the income\u201d, \u201cavoid paying tax\u201d, \u201cextracted millions\u201d or \u201cdid not care whether the ITA was complied with\u201d.\n[96] The Respondent has made concessions as described below with regard to repetitiveness, but none was made regarding the alleged use of colorful and vexatious language. According to the Respondent, it is proper to plead the factual underpinnings to support a position of sham, including facts of an intention to mislead. As such, the Reply should remain as drafted.\nB. Analysis\nRepetitiveness\n[97] The Reply is very long: it consists of forty (40) pages plus eighty-five (85) pages of Schedules attached to the Reply. As mentioned above, all the Schedules are included by reference in the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment. Pages 8 to 29 of the Reply (paragraph 27, including subparagraphs 27.1 to 27.126) state the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment and pages 29 to 34 (paragraph 28, including subparagraphs 28.1 to 28.57) state the facts relied upon by the Minister to assess the penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act. The issues to be decided, the statutory provisions, grounds relied on and relief sought are found at pages 34 to 40.\n[98] A reply should not be struck for being lengthy, but repetitive pleadings are to be struck (CIBC, FCA, at para 83). The purpose of pleadings are to give an overview and the parties will have the opportunity at trial to communicate their entire version of events (Strother, at paras 39-43). As stated by this Court, repetition creates uncertainty and impedes the objectives of conciseness and certainty in pleadings (Husky Oil, at para 31).\n[99] The Respondent has made the following concessions regarding repetition in the Reply, and the Reply shall be amended accordingly:\ni)Remove subparagraph 28.17 and keep subparagraph 27.29;\nii)Remove subparagraph 28.22 and keep subparagraph 27.27;\niii)Remove subparagraph 28.40 and keep subparagraph 27.123; and\niv)Remove subparagraph 27.86 and modify subparagraph 27.23 to read as follows:\n27.23 The purpose of advertising itself as being in the business of mergers and acquisitions was to\n27.23.1 deceive the Minister into believing that 409 Ltd. and the Appellant, as applicable, reported the funds received from the Abacus Tax Plans as borrowed funds, and not income; and\n27.23.2 deceive the Minister as to the true nature of its business by suggesting the existence of a continued business for TargetCo when there was none.\n[100] The Appellant has brought to the Court\u2019s attention what it sees as other repetitions in the Reply.\n[101] I find that some of the impugned paragraphs are not repetitive, but others are.\n[102] More specifically, I find that the following subparagraphs are repetitive: subparagraphs 27.28 and 27.43; subparagraphs 28.14, 28.20 and 28.54; subparagraphs 28.8 and 28.20; subparagraphs 27.61 and 28.6 (Negus signed many of the promissory notes); and subparagraphs 28.8 and 28.14. As stated above, repetitive pleadings should be struck. For these reasons, the Respondent shall amend the Reply to remove all the above-mentioned repetitions.\n[103] Moreover, I wish to address subparagraphs 27.29 to 27.32.3, 27.33 to 27.68, 27.69 to 27.86 and Schedule C, which give explanations concerning the Abacus Tax Plan.\n[104] Firstly, I will deal with Schedule C. Schedule C is referred to in subparagraphs 27.32 and 27.33 of the Reply, which read as follows:\n27.32 \u201c The Abacus Tax Plan, described in Schedule \u201cC\u201d attached, involved a series of transactions that was promoted to the Abacus Group\u2019s customers to ultimately result in \u2026\u201d\n27.33 \u201cThe outlines of the Abacus Tax Plan, as described further in Schedule \u201cC\u201d involved a series of transactions that included the following steps\u2026\u201d\n[105] Schedule C, entitled \u201cOverview of the Abacus Tax Plan\u201d, is an outline pictographic representation of the step transactions involved in implementing an Abacus Tax Plan. It is drafted on a no-name basis and is eight (8) pages long.\n[106] According to the Respondent, Schedule C sets out the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact about the general steps in the series of transactions involved in implementing Abacus Tax Plans sold by 4092325 Investments Ltd. and the Appellant during the years under appeal. More specifically, it sets out the Minister\u2019s understanding of the steps in the transactions used to implement Abacus Tax Plans. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the diagrams found in Schedule C do not prove the transactions.\n[107] At the hearing, the Respondent argued that \u201c\u2026there is certainly a benefit for the judge who will have to understand all of these things to be able to be given the broad overview of the ... a picture of what is going on and there is absolutely no problem in putting that sort of aid as part of the pleadings.\u201d (Transcripts, November 25, 2022, pp.49-50).\n[108] For the following reasons, I find that Schedule C shall be struck. In addition to being repetitive, Schedule C does not contain any material facts as it is drafted with generic words, and thus, it does not belong in the pleadings (Section 49 of the Rules). I agree with the Appellant that it would be impossible for the Appellant to provide any answer, if the Appellant wishes, in respect of Schedule C.\n[109] With respect to subparagraphs 27.29 to 27.32.3, which give a second overview of the Abacus Tax Plan, the first overview being in the preamble to the Reply, they are allowed to remain in the Reply.\n[110] Subparagraphs 27.33 to 27.68 describe the series of transactions involved in the implementation of an Abacus Tax Plan, on a step-by-step basis, and are not referring to a particular Abacus Tax Plan. Subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.81 describe the series of transactions involved in the implementation of a particular Abacus Tax Plan called the REA Abacus Tax Plan, on a step-by-step basis. The REA Abacus Tax Plan is the first Abacus Tax Plan referred to in Schedule B, listing all the Abacus Tax Plans in the years under appeal.\n[111] I find that subparagraphs 27.33 to 27.68 and subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.81 are not repetitive, and hence these subparagraphs should not be struck for being repetitive, because subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.81 refer to a particular Abacus Tax Plan and subparagraphs 27.33 to 27.68 do not.\n[112] I also find that subparagraphs 27.82 and 27.83 dealing with other plans are not repetitive, nor are subparagraphs 27.84, 27.85 and 27.86 of the Reply, which are allowed to remain.\n[113] The Appellant alleges also that the Schedules are inherently repetitive.\n[114] I find that Schedules A, D, E and F are not repetitive. Further, Schedule B, which details numerous \u201cplans\u201d, cannot be considered repetitive. These Abacus Tax Plans are similar to each other and so on a cursory view Schedule B could be seen as repetitive. However, as particular Abacus Tax Plans are described, there is no repetition per se. The description of each plan includes numbers and names unique to the transactions involved under each plan.\n[115] Further, I find that the following subparagraphs are not repetitive: subparagraphs 27.48 and 27.64; subparagraphs 27.54, 27.56, 27.92, and 28.12; subparagraphs 27.21 and 27.22; subparagraphs 27.58, 27.59, 27.60 and 27.61; subparagraphs 27.46 and 27.93; subparagraphs 27.85, 28.7 and 28.19; subparagraphs 28.20 and 28.46. Therefore, these subparagraphs are allowed to remain in the Reply.\nColorful and vexatious language\n[116] As stated by this Court in CIBC, TCC, a balance needs to be found in pleadings. Pleadings might be struck because they were inserted for colour, or simply as they are inflammatory. Regarding the words \u201cscandalous, frivolous and vexatious\u201d, this Court found that they are \u201cstrong, emotionally charged and derogatory expressions denoting pleading that is patently and flagrantly without merit; their application should be reserved for the plainest and most egregiously senseless assertions\u201d (see Sentinel Hill, at para 11).\n[117] More recently, this Court stated that pleadings should be struck for being \u201cscandalous, frivolous or vexatious\u201d only in the most obvious of cases (see Mudge, at para 20).\n[118] Moreover, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that words or phrases that express the Crown\u2019s disapproval or evaluate the morality of a taxpayer can be properly struck as being scandalous or prejudicial (see CIBC, FCA, at para 89).\n[119] As stated above, this Court has held that \u201cin the context of an alleged sham, the factual underpinnings (such as an intention to mislead) may be pleaded as facts assumed by the Minister\u201d (see Chad, at para 42).\n[120] I find that the use of phrases such as \u201chiding the income\u201d or \u201cavoid paying taxes\u201d would be appropriate; these are the factual underpinnings of the sham alleged in this appeal. Most of the assumptions the Appellant wishes to be struck as being colorful and vexatious fit into this category and should not be struck.\n[121] Hence, the following subparagraphs are appropriate in that respect: title \u201cHiding the income\u201d between subparagraphs 27.74.43 and 27.74.44, the use of \u201cavoid paying tax\u201d in subparagraphs 27.30 and 27.84, the use of the expression \u201chide the reality\u201d in subparagraph 27.64, the second overview of the Abacus Tax Plan in subparagraphs 27.29 to 21.32.3 referring to the avoidance of tax, subparagraph 27.66 which refers to the funds being available through purported loans, subparagraph 27.84 which refers to the fact that the TargetCos were avoiding paying tax, and subparagraph 27.110 which provides that \u201cOne purpose of selling 409 Ltd\u2019s business to the appellant was to prevent the Minister from taking steps to collect 409 Ltd\u2019s debts\u201d, subparagraphs 27.79 to 27.81 in respect of CardioRX Partnership.\n[122] However, I find that subparagraph 27.67 which states that \u201cFunds received by Negus were used to pay for Negus\u2019 living expenses\u201d should be struck. Furthermore, footnote 8 referred to in subparagraph 27.74.38 should also be struck since it makes reference to the word \u201csham\u201d and it gives the Minister\u2019s position, which is not appropriate in that part of the Reply.\n[123] In addition, I do not find that Schedule D should be struck for using colourful or vexatious language.\n[124] Other paragraphs the Appellant alleges use colorful and vexatious language are found in the part of the Reply stating the facts relied on by the Minister to assess penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act.\n[125] According to the Appellant, subparagraphs 28.4 (\u201cNegus\u2026extracted millions..\u201d), 28.5 (\u201cNegus started implementing tax plans beginning in 1996\u201d), 28.10 (\u201cNegus is responsible for directing corporate funds to himself for his personal use and enjoyment\u201d), 28.50 (\u201cNegus did not care whether the ITA was complied with\u201d), 28.51 (\u201cNegus ordered the appellant\u2019s employees to not report the income it earned\u201d), 28.55 (\u201cIn 2012, the appellant paid $1.3 million of Negus\u2019s personal expenses\u201d), 28.56 (\u201cIn 2013-2015, over $11 million was directed to Negus\u2019s agent corporation Forbes &Thompson\u201d), and 28.57 (\u201cNegus did not report as income any of the funds received from the appellant\u201d) should be struck on that basis.\n[126] As the Minister bears the burden of establishing the facts justifying the assessment of penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act (subs. 163(3) of the Act), namely that the Appellant knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made a false statement or omission in a return or other form, statement or answer for the purposes of the Act, the Minister has to plead sufficient facts to meet its burden. I therefore find that all subparagraphs of the Reply stating the facts relied upon by the Minister to assess penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act should remain in the Reply, as they do not meet the clear and obvious test required for striking pleadings on the basis of being colorful or vexatious.\n5.5 Vagueness, immateriality and disclosure of confidential information\nA. Positions of the parties\n[127] According to the Appellant, the Reply is unusually lengthy, vague and convoluted and is replete with irrelevant statements of facts and law. It does not fulfill its purpose, namely to define the issues in dispute for the purposes of production, discovery and trial (Zelinski, at para 4). A pleading should state facts concisely in a summary form (Husky Oil, at para 31).\n[128] Further, according to the Appellant, the Reply improperly discloses confidential information pertaining to both the Appellant and third parties, which bears no relevance to the appeal. The Appellant refers to Schedule B-12 of the Reply that contains a bank account number. Moreover, the Appellant refers to Schedules A to F that contain information which should not be disclosed as the information goes far beyond what is relevant and necessary at this stage of the appeal process for the Respondent to make its case.\n[129] According to the Respondent, the Reply is not vague, ambiguous or misleading, nor does it fail to define the factual and legal issues in dispute. Further, it does not state immaterial facts. The Respondent argues that the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment are completely, precisely and accurately stated in the Reply. All assumptions of fact contained in the Reply, including Schedules A to F, are relevant to the Respondent\u2019s position that the Appellant earned unreported income during the years under appeal, and are relevant to the Respondent\u2019s arguments related to sham. Further, the issues set out in the Reply are substantially similar to the issues described by the Appellant in the Notice of Appeal.\n[130] At the hearing, however, the Respondent conceded that the bank account number indicated in Schedule B-12 should have been redacted. Otherwise, the Respondent takes the view that the Reply and all the Schedules do not disclose irrelevant confidential information of the Appellant or third parties.\n[131] Furthermore, according to the Respondent, as discoveries have not yet taken place, the Appellant is not in a position to know which assumptions of fact were or were not made by the Minister in issuing the assessment because the Appellant does not have proper evidence from a deponent in this litigation. Hence, there is no basis to strike the Reply in its entirety for any alleged failure to disclose assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment.\nB. Analysis\n[132] I agree with the Respondent that the case law is clear: there is a high bar for striking pleadings for being immaterial. Generally, matters of relevancy and materiality are better left to the Trial Judge who will hear the appeal and not to the Motion Judge (Kopstein v. R, 2010 TCC 448 [Kopstein], at paras 22-23; Mudge, at para 15; Mungovan v. The Queen, 55 DTC 691, [2001] 3 CTC 2779 [Mungovan] at para 12).\n[133] More precisely, courts have held that challenges about immateriality of assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment should not be determined at an early stage but are best determined after discovery, and ultimately, are best made by the Trial Judge (Mudge, at para 34).\n[134] The case law has also holds that third party information can be included in a pleading when it is relevant (see Heining v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 47; R\u00e9millard v. Canada (National Revenue), 2021 FC 644 at para 55). For that purpose, the reply must show how this information is relevant (see Kopstein, at para 60):\n[60] This is an opportune place to mention a different point raised by the appellant with respect to assumptions related to third parties. Where there are assumptions related to the actions of third parties, the reply must show how those assumptions relate to the assessment in issue.[29] This is a question of relevance. In determining whether the reply complies with this, one must look at the reply as a whole.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[135] At this stage of the appeal process, I find that the Reply is not vague, nor ambiguous nor misleading, but rather fully discloses the basis of the assessment of the Appellant made by the Minister. Further, the Reply is not so immaterial on its face as to require a Motion Judge to strike it, without leave to amend, but, for the reasons below, for Schedules A and D.\nSchedule A\n[136] Schedule A entitled \u201cAbacus Group Organization Structure in the Years Under Appeal\u201d is an organizational chart showing the relationships between the various entities, part of the Abacus Group, of which the Appellant is part of.\n[137] Subparagraphs 27.1 to 27.21 of the Reply describe the organization of the Abacus Group. Schedule A is referred to in subparagraph 27.6 of the Reply, which reads as follows:\nIn the years under appeal, the appellant was a member of a group of entities (\u201cAbacus Group\u201d), which was organized as set out in Schedule \u201cA\u201d, attached.\n[138] The Respondent argues that Schedule A will help the Trial Judge understand the structure of the group.\n[139] I agree with the Respondent that Schedule A will help the Trial Judge understand the group structure. However, Schedule A discloses confidential information about third parties. The Chart found in Schedule A refers to individuals and to corporations other than individuals and corporations referred to in the body of the Reply. I find that the Reply does not show how that information is relevant to the assessment of the Appellant. Furthermore, the Appellant could not properly answer a diagram, should it wish to do so. For these reasons, I find that Schedule A, as drafted, should be struck; the Respondent should extricate the relevant material facts from Schedule A and include these material facts in the body of the Reply.\nSchedule D\n[140] The Appellant takes specific issue with Schedule D entitled \u201cThe Cardio Rx Partnership\u201d for disclosing confidential information about third parties. The Appellant also takes issue with Schedule D as being evidence, which issue will be dealt with in the following section. Schedule D contains 87 paragraphs and is eleven (11) pages long.\n[141] Schedule D is referred to in subparagraph 27.79 of the Reply, which reads as follows:\nFollowing steps 1-11, the REA Promissory Notes #3 held by REA against 790 Canada Ltd. was assigned to the purported Cardio RX Partnership, which was used as part of the Abacus Tax Plan, the details of which are described in Schedule \u201cD\u201d attached.\n[142] Steps 1-11 referred to in subparagraph 27.79 are the steps involved in implementing the particular Abacus Tax Plan called the REA Abacus Tax Plan (subparagraphs 27.74 (including 27.74.1 to 27.74.49) to 27.78). The title above subparagraph 27.79 reads as follows: \u201cCardio RX Partnership (Steps following the REA Abacus Tax Plan)\u201d.\n[143] I agree with the Appellant that Cardio RX Partnership is a third party and that Cardio RX Partnership\u2019s assessment is not the subject of the present appeal, but the Appellant\u2019s assessment is. There is generally nothing wrong in having assumptions of fact in pleadings describing the relationship between an appellant and third parties, when that relationship bears some relevance to the assessment of the appellant, and specifically, when the Minister is alleging an appellant participated in a \u201cscheme\u201d (see Standfield v. R, 2007 TCC 480, at para 44). One can argue that that is more so in the present appeal where the Minister is alleging that the Appellant sold these Abacus Tax Plans to its various clients for a fee.\n[144] Here, the Minister had assumed that Cardio RX Partnership is part of Abacus Tax Plans (see subparagraph 27.79, and also subparagraphs 27.80 and 27.81). However, even if the Minister had assumed that Cardio RX Partnership is part of Abacus Tax Plans, upon examining the Reply as a whole, I find that Cardio RX Partnership is not relevant to the assessment of the Appellant. As stated in the Reply, Cardio RX Partnership is relevant for steps following the implementation of an Abacus Tax Plan. According to the Reply, following the implementation of an Abacus Tax Plan, the corporation (referred to as TargetCo in the Reply), that sold assets (shares) and realized a capital gain on their disposition, became a partner of the Cardio RX Partnership and was allocated enough losses from that partnership to offset the capital gain. However, the Reply does not show how Cardio RX Partnership is relevant to the assessment of the Appellant. Issues described in the Reply, which are essentially the same as the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal, do not result from operations between the Appellant and Cardio RX Partnership. I also agree with the Appellant that debate about Cardio RX Partnership relates to the assessment of the TargetCos and not that of the Appellant.\n[145] Furthermore, Schedule D, as worded, states clearly that \u201cThe Minister made the following assumptions of fact relative to the Cardio RX Partnership\u201d. According to para. 49(1)(d) of the Rules, that part of the Reply should indicate the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment. Neither Schedule D nor any other part of the Reply indicate how the assumptions found in Schedule D are relevant to the assessment of the Appellant. For these reasons, Schedule D should be struck. However, subparagraphs 27.79 to 27.86 are allowed to remain.\n[146] Finally, the Appellant has not brought the Court\u2019s attention to other specific violations of third-party confidential information, but merely broadly point to all of the Schedules to the Reply.\n[147] I find that as there is nothing on the face of the Schedules that appears confidential, there is nothing to be struck on this ground, apart from Schedules A and D and the indication of the bank account number in Schedule B-12.\n5.6 Inclusion of evidence\nA. Positions of the parties\n[148] According to the Appellant, Schedules B to F should be struck because they contain improper inclusion of evidence, which will be impossible for the Appellant to admit or deny, as well as arguments and conclusions of facts and law, and they provide analysis of issues. These Schedules \u201c...include dozens of pages of \u201cworking papers\u201d, some of which reference third parties and which were created by, one can only assume, unnamed Canada Revenue Agency auditors\u201d (Appellant\u2019s notes and authorities dated November 23, 2022 (the \u201cAppellant\u2019s Submissions\u201d), at para 12). The Appellant argues that the Respondent cannot stealthily insert facts and evidence as schedules to the Reply. Any evidence the Respondent intends to put to the Court should be presented at the trial rather than improperly included in the Reply.\n[149] Moreover, according to the Appellant, if the Schedules were to remain, the Appellant could not formulate a proper answer. The Appellant will be unfairly prejudiced, as it will bear the burden to rebut \u201call assumptions of fact\u201d made in the Reply (see paragraph 15 of the Appellant\u2019s Submissions).\n[150] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86 of the Reply should be struck for the same reasons.\n[151] According to the Respondent, the Schedules to the Reply are generally not in the nature of evidence, and there is no basis for striking of the Schedules in full, without leave to amend because the defects in the Schedules can be cured by amendments. However, the Respondent concedes that parts of Schedules B-1 to B\u201142 do contain evidence; hence, they should be amended.\n[152] At the hearing, the Respondent offered to amend Schedules B-1 to B-42 to remove what it feels were incorrectly pleaded in the assumptions of facts. The Respondent provided a representative sample of proposed draft amendments to be made to Schedules B-1 to B-42. Some of the amendments made were to remedy the inclusion of evidence.\n[153] As for the other Schedules and for subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86 of the Reply, the Respondent is of the view that no amendments are required as these Schedules and subparagraphs do not contain evidence.\nB. Analysis\n[154] Evidence does not belong in pleadings. The case law is clear: \u201cit is not proper to refer in a pleading to evidence upon which a party intends to rely\u201d (Okoroze v. R, 2012 TCC 360, at para 12). As stated by this Court, \u201c[F]acts as to how an allegation will be proved are basically facts as to evidence and so should not be pleaded\u201d (Mudge, at para 20).\n[155] It can be prejudicial to an appellant when evidence is pleaded as assumptions of facts due to the onus to disprove these assumptions at trial. There is, however, no bright line to distinguish pleaded facts from pleaded evidence (Mudge, at para. 51).\n[156] In order for a Motion Judge to strike part of a pleading as being evidence, it must be clear and obvious that the facts as alleged are evidence (Algoma Central Corp. v. R 2009, TCC 314, at para 23). Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that the Minister has the responsibility to set out the case they are making against a taxpayer by fully setting out the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment.\n[157] In this appeal, the Minister alleges a complicated tax scheme put in place by the Appellant for the benefit of numerous clients to allow them to sell assets without paying tax on the proceeds of disposition, in consideration for a fee, which was not reported by the Appellant as income. Instead of reporting the fees as income, the Appellant is taking the view that it had borrowed money from certain corporations, and issued promissory notes in that respect. Thus, in that regard, the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment will be more fulsome.\n[158] Furthermore, as mentioned above, other issues are raised by this appeal, namely whether unbilled revenues of 4092325 Investments Ltd. acquired by the Appellant as work-in-progress were taxable income, whether capital cost allowance and cumulative eligible capital expenditures were created, and whether interest were deductible. The Minister is also pleading sham and assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act for some taxation years.\n[159] Determining whether to strike a pleading, specifically assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment, on the basis that it includes evidence involves the balancing of two factors: the first being that, in general, the Trial Judge will be in a better position to determine whether an assumption is fact or evidence and the second is that pleading evidence as assumptions puts the onus on the appellant to disprove the assumptions.\n[160] With these principles in mind, I will turn now to the various Schedules attached to the Reply (except Schedule A, which was dealt with in the previous section of these Reasons for Order) and to subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86 of the Reply.\nSchedule B and Schedules B-1 to B-42\n[161] Schedule B entitled \u201cAbacus Tax Plans in the years under appeal\u201d is a chart of 5 columns detailing the 42 Abacus Tax Plans allegedly put in place by the Appellant for the years under appeal: column 1 contains the name of the tax plan, column 2 contains the year the plan was implemented, column 3 contains the total income received from the plan, column 4 contains the amount of the purported promissory notes which are challenged by the Minister, and column 5 contains details of the plan and makes a respective reference to Schedules B-1 to B-42 that contain specific details on the various tax plans.\n[162] Schedule B is referred to in the following three subparagraphs of the Reply:\ni)in subparagraph 27.25 of the Reply, which reads as follows: \u201cIn the years under appeal, the Abacus Group earned income implementing Abacus Tax Plans for various customers, described further in Schedule B\u201d;\nii)in subparagraph 27.27 of the Reply. which reads as follows: \u201cIn the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years, the appellant earned the following amounts of income from the Abacus Tax Plans, which it did not report, the further details of which are set out in Schedule \u201cB\u201d, attached: ...\u201d;\niii)in subparagraph 27.83 of the Reply, which reads as follows: \u201cOther than the minor variations such as those described in paragraph 27.82, above, there are no material differences between the REA Abacus Tax Plandescribed in paragraph 27.74 and the Abacus Tax Plans identified in Schedule \u201cB\u201d, that were completed in the years under appeal.\u201d\n[163] According to the Respondent, Schedule B is not evidence; it sets out the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact in respect of the revenues the Appellant earned from its clients in the years under appeal. Whether the Appellant earned fees from its clients in the years under appeal as well as the amount of the various promissory notes created in the course of implementing the various Abacus Tax Plans are questions of fact.\n[164] As mentioned above, at the hearing, the Respondent conceded that portions of Schedules B-1 to B-42 contain statements of evidence, as well as conclusions of law. The Respondent proposed to amend these schedules to delete references to the word \u201csham\u201d, to elements of evidence and to conclusions of law (see Appendix C to these Reasons for Order for a representative sample of amendments). As these defects can be cured by amendments, there is no reason to strike the Schedules in their entirety.\n[165] As mentioned above, Schedule B is part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment. I find that Schedule B can remain in the Reply without column 5 entitled \u201cDetails\u201d, which column is evidence and does not belong to pleadings.\n[166] I also find that Schedules B-1 to B-42 contain various element of evidence, as well as arguments and conclusions of law or mixed facts and law and provide analyses of issues. I agree with the Appellant that these Schedules look like working papers as they give details of transactions, provide analyses of issues and conclusions of law or mixed facts and law. Being part of the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment, it is inappropriate for these Schedules to include evidence, analyses of issues or conclusions of law or mixed fact and law. These schedules contain details of the various Abacus Tax Plans allegedly sold by the Appellant (and 4092325 Investments Ltd.) to its clients and are already listed on Schedule B. I find that Schedules B-1 to B-42 as worded shall be struck in their entirety as being evidence. Concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing are not sufficient to address the inclusion of evidence in the Schedules B-1 to B-42.\nSchedule D and subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86\n[167] According to the Appellant, subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86, together with Schedule D \u2013 The Cardio RX Partnership, are evidence, and on that basis, they should be struck from the pleadings. According to the Respondent, Schedule D is not evidence \u2013 it sets out the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact regarding the creation of the Cardio RX Partnership and the role that the Cardio RX Partnership played in implementing Abacus Tax Plans. The Respondent argues that striking Schedule D would leave a gap in the Reply.\n[168] As mentioned above, Schedule D entitled \u201cThe Cardio Rx Partnership\u201d contains the assumptions of facts relative to Cardio Rx Partnership and is referred to in subparagraph 27.79 of the Reply. I agree with the Appellant that Schedule D is evidence, and should also be struck on that basis.\n[169] Subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.81 titled \u201cThe REA Abacus Tax Plan \u2013 a representative example\u201d describe the steps transaction involved with respect to the implementation of an Abacus Tax Plan for one particular client called the REA Abacus Tax Plan. The REA Abacus Tax Plan is the first plan listed on Schedule B. Subparagraphs 27.82 and 27.83 stated the variations from the REA Abacus Tax Plan and other Abacus Tax Plans listed in Schedule B. Subparagraphs 27.84, 27.85 and 27.86 contain other assumptions of fact.\n[170] I do not agree with the Appellant that subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86 are also evidence. I find that subparagraphs 27.69 to 27.86 should not be struck on that basis. At this stage of the appeal process, it is not clear and obvious that the facts as alleged in these subparagraphs are evidence. Furthermore, the Minister has to fully set out the case they are making against a taxpayer by fully setting out the assumptions of fact made by the Minister when making the assessment. The Trial Judge will be in a far better position to make that determination.\nSchedule E\n[171] Schedule E entitled \u201cParticulars of the Assumed 409 Notes\u201d is a chart containing 3 columns; column 1 lists the name of the specific Abacus Tax Plan, column 2 lists the name of the Note Holder(s), and column 3 lists the amount assigned to APEL. It is referred to in subparagraph 27.106, which reads as follows:\nThe details of the Assumed 409 Notes that were purportedly assumed to pay the balance of the 409 Purchase Price are attached as Schedule \u201cE\u201d.\n[172] According to the Respondent, Schedule E is not evidence. Schedule E sets out the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact in respect of purported promissory notes that were assigned to the Appellant in purported satisfaction of the purchase price for 4092325 Investments Ltd.\u2019s assets. Whether a particular note was assigned to the Appellant is a question of fact; the name of the person who holds the promissory note is a question of fact and the stated value of the note is a question of fact.\n[173] I agree with the Respondent. I find that Schedule E is not evidence. Schedule E is relevant and is allowed to remain.\nSchedule F\n[174] Schedule F entitled \u201cAppellant\u2019s CCA for the years under appeal\u201d is a chart which sets out the Capital Cost Allowance adjustments made by the Minister in the years under appeal. It is referred to in paragraph 27.111 of the Reply, which reads as follows:\nIn the years under appeal, the appellant reported CCA schedules as set out in Schedule \u201cF\u201d, attached.\n[175] According to the Respondent, this Schedule is not evidence. At the hearing, the Respondent argues that it Schedule F represents the capital cost allowance as claimed by the Appellant over the years under appeal. The Respondent recognized that Schedule F is a bit tedious to read but it was decided to be done this way in order to achieve concision in the pleadings.\n[176] Schedule F contains 14 columns, and refers to five different classes for depreciation. For each class, there is an indication as to the capital cost allowance reported by the Appellant for each year under appeal, and the revised amount of capital cost allowance I assumed was allowed by the Minister.\n[177] The problem I have with Schedule F is the columns indicating the revised amount of capital cost allowance I assume was allowed by the Minister. This is not an assumption of fact made by the Minister in making the assessment. Hence, part of Schedule F is evidence. Accordingly, Schedule F is allowed to remain but shall be amended to remove these columns. Alternatively, the Respondent can choose to extricate the material facts assumed by the Minister in making the assessment, and insert them in the body of the Reply.\n5.7 Remedy\n[178] The Appellant submits that the Reply as a whole must be struck as it cannot be cured by amendment and is unanswerable. Further, the Appellant states that with the Reply as it now stands discovery would be unmanageable.\n[179] I agree with the Appellant that given the extent of the deficiencies found in the Reply, the Reply cannot be cured by simple amendment. If the Reply were to stand, the scope of discoveries would be unmanageable (Simon, at para 49). The Reply has to be struck as, for the reasons detailed above, it will either prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal, or is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious, or is an abuse of the process of this Court.\n[180] However, I do not agree with the Appellant that the Reply should be struck without leave to amend and that this Court should allow the Appeal. The proper remedy is to strike the Reply and allow the Respondent to file a fresh reply that meets the requirements set out in the Rules and by this Court. I find that the Reply shows a reasonable basis for the Respondent to argue that the reassessments under appeal are correct, and thus, the Court should grant the Respondent leave to amend the Reply. As indicated above, for a claim to be struck without leave to amend, there must not be a \u201cscintilla\u201d of a legitimate cause for action (Riabko, at para 8), which is not the case in the present appeal.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 18th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J.\nAppendix A\n7 A failure to comply with these rules is an irregularity and does not render a proceeding or a step, document or direction in a proceeding a nullity, and the Court,\n(a) may grant all necessary amendments or other relief, on such terms as are just, to secure the just determination of the real matters in dispute, or\n(b) only where and as necessary in the interests of justice, may set aside the proceeding or a step, document or direction in the proceeding in whole or in part.\n7 L\u2019inobservation des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles constitue une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 et n\u2019est pas cause de nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019instance ni d\u2019une mesure prise, d\u2019un document donn\u00e9 ou d\u2019une directive rendue dans le cadre de celle-ci.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Minister made a decision that a certain post-doctoral fellow (\u201cPDF\u201d) was an employee of the Appellant, the University of New Brunswick (the \u201cUniversity\u201d), during March, 2018 until August, 2020 (the \u201cperiod\u201d).\n[2] The University appeals that decision. Four witnesses testified at the hearing. The PDF herself, Dr. Suzanne Lanery, was called as a witness by the Respondent and two faculty professors and the manager of the Office of the VP Research were called by the University.\n[3] Post-Doctoral Fellows (\u201cPDFs\u201d) are PhD recipients hired by, through and at universities to pursue studies, research and experimentation, as the case may be, in their respective fields of intellectual expertise. In doing so, PDFs sharpen their scholastic skills and enhance the University\u2019s general environment of higher learner. As is seen in these reasons, within this exalted platitude rests a more base questions: who benefits most from the PDF work?\nII. FACTS [4] The factual evidence was largely uncontested. The disparity lay in the emphasis and interpretation of the simple, unvarnished question posed above.\nPDF\u2019s right to stay and study in Canada\n[5] In this appeal, the PDF, Dr. Lanery, was neither a Canadian nor a resident of Canada. Hence, she needed a work permit. Her immigration work permit was produced at trial. The work permit skirts the issue of the nature of status and duties at the University. Particularly, was the contract one \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cof\u201d service. Its title, \u201cwork permit\u201d, and the described occupation \u201cPost-Doctoral Fellow\u201d beg the very question. On the permit, the pre-printed information of \u201cEmployer\u201d and employment location both apply to foreign workers engaged in contracts \u201cof\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d service. Interestingly, the PDF was issued a University identity card which labelled her \u201cfaculty\/staff\u201d.\nWhat the work of a PDF entails according to the written agreement?\n[6] The vague and anachronistic world of academia also provides indeterminate guidance. The relevant agreement does not provide much more assistance. The original PDF offer and extension contained elements of both employment and a contract for service. The expanded description of \u201cpost-doctoral fellowship\u201d harkens of communal brainstorming. Remuneration is described as an annual award. In contrast, deductions were made from income by the University and a T4 information slip was issued.\n[7] The PDF \u201caward sum\u201d was specifically circumscribed: \u201cit does not constitute employment income, it is not subject to deductions for CPP, EI,.. or other [University] faculty benefits\u2026\u201d. PDFs receive credit and have responsibility for research and retain ownership of same. A royalty free licence to use such intellectual property (IP) is reserved by the University.\n[8] The PDF\u2019s specific contractual responsibility is to \u201ccontinue your work on conducting research in projective quantum field theory and applications to quantum theory\u201d, Dr. Lanery\u2019s field. Clearly, the PDF is responsible for the \u201cresearch\u201d; the questions for whom, when and to what end remain undescribed.\nWho pays the PDF\u2019s remuneration?\n[9] The source of the PDF \u201caward\u201d is not as simple as it seems. The University effects payment of each bi-weekly deposit to the PDF\u2019s bank account. Behind that curtain, the source of funds springs from various places at various times. In Dr. Lanery\u2019s first year, the tripartite source of funds from various funding agencies was different than in the second year. University administrators and faculty members were in a perpetual scramble to match sources of funds with the need to pay the PDF\u2019s \u201cannual award\u201d. Should funding not have been matched, the Court does not doubt that the PDF would otherwise have been paid, and afterwards the accounting \u201cchips\u201d would have fallen where they may. However vague, the source of funds was enumerated on a schedule to the PDF offer and agreement, accompanied by liberally applied illegible, handwritten arrows, figures and notations.\nWhat were the \u201cspecific\u201d tasks and who \u201csupervised\u201d the PDF\u2019s?\n[10] PDFs received minimal oversight and supervision. All witnesses were consistent on this. The range of descriptors of the position (aside from the teaching employment income) was broad. The gamut spanned aspirational goals: (i) opportunity for \u2026 [PDFs]\u2026 to carry on individual research; to participate fully in .. research, teaching and supervisory activities at the .. [University];\u2026 to enhance their future opportunities for research and teaching; and, conduct \u2026 research and disseminate the results through tasks and papers, and organizing weekly group meetings.\n[11] The witnesses used equally \u201cfluffy\u201d language updated to modern colloquia. PDF\u2019s were to \u201cfreely engage in blue sky research\u201d, to \u201cbroadly research without limitations on scope\u201d and be part of a research skills \u201cincubator\u201d which would \u201cgrow\u201d academic expertise generally.\n[12] A specific \u201csupervisor\u201d was assigned and supervised very little. Testimony made clear that unless there was an extended absence of effort -- no presence either on campus or otherwise and a gaping inattention to generic research -- then no criticism or consequences ever occurred. Unless these \u201cred flags\u201d appeared, the PDF was free to explore academic research as, when and how the PDF wished.\n[13] Consistent with this \u201cfree range\u201d approach, there were no academic \u201ctime clocks\u201d, hours of attendance or mandatory reviews. Weekly discussions were held to exchange concepts and findings derived from this open research environment.\n[14] The PDFs were not constrained from pursuing other work or activities: teaching roles were available, but not mandatory. Since working days were not defined, PDFs were free to pursue other opportunities and seek other input wherever and whenever each wanted.\nWho provided what to whom?\n[15] Briefly, PDFs received the benefits of an academy at which one could pursue open research (in one\u2019s chosen field of expertise) towards a goal of refining academic research skills and expression. This was achieved through academic collegiality with the academy comprised of faculty and other PDFs and staff. Each was paid an \u201caward\u201d by costed funding sources to afford the open research.\n[16] In contrast, the benefit to the University was the presence of more junior academics, graduate PhDs to provide heft to the faculty; young, agile thinkers who honed their craft through discussions and conferences, their thought and enhanced, scholarship and ideas. Practically, it also provided a stable of junior teachers and tutorial leaders, although these positions were separately contracted and remunerated.\nUnionization of PDF\u2019s: coincidence or corollary?\n[17] The curious twist to this appeal is that it is likely the last of its kind for the University. The appeal period applies to Dr. Lanery\u2019s work term of March, 2018 until August, 2020.\n[18] In September of 2020, the University executed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a collective bargaining unit (CBU) for PDFs. By such written agreement, the CBA unionized all PDFs with certain other employees at the University within the CBU. After that date, the CBA, in contrast to the previous PDF engagement letters, contractually states that all PDFs are employees.\n[19] Coincidentally, the Respondent\u2019s witness, Dr. Lanery, was a member of the negotiating team for the CBU and was a representative signatory to the CBA. Not surprisingly, her view is and has always been that PDFs are and were employees of the University.\nIII. THE ISSUE [20] The parties within their written submissions generally agree that the issue to be decided is the dominant characteristic or purpose of the payments made to Dr. Lanery during the period. Was the dominant characteristic of the payments paid to Dr. Lanery for:\n1. her work provided to, or for the benefit of, the University; or\n2. the furtherance of her academic studies or research?\nIV. THE LAW [21] The parties also agree that the correct test to be applied in this appeal is reflected in Caropreso v. HMQ, 2012 TCC 212 (\u201cCaropreso\u201d). At paragraph 20 in that appeal, specifically involving PDFs, Justice Woods states:\nThe root of the difficulty is that payments to postdoctoral research fellows often have dual elements. The payments further the education of research fellows and they also provide compensation for work performed. If the payments are received by virtue of employment, this takes precedence. However, in making this determination, it is relevant to consider the dominant characteristic of the payments, whether it is compensation for work or student assistance.\n[22] Interpreting Justice Wood\u2019s test has led to different outcomes. The task of this Court is to assess the evidence and determine whether the payments were either dominant:\na) in the nature of financial assistance, as was determined in Bekhor v. MNR, 2005 TCC 443 (\u201cBekhor\u201d); or,\nb) in the nature of income for work and services provided to the educational institution, as was determined in Chabaud v. HMQ, 2011 TCC 438.\n[23] In Caropreso, Justice Woods did not specifically list factors or indicia critical to determining which outcome was dominant, and deductively which was subsidiary. Various cases have analyzed, as the case may be, the sources of funding for PDF compensation, control over the PDF\u2019s activities, furtherance of education and the parties\u2019 intention (and the subsequent concordant or discordant reality). Further, the other usual factors of tools, chance of profit\/risk of loss and who benefits from the activities may also play a role in the analysis.\n[24] What the jurisprudence distills for this Court, in the absence of a definitive Federal Court of Appeal decision and preference, is the need for analysis of the evidence to achieve a decision on one of two dominant purposes: whether on balance the payments were made on account of monetary assistance to enhance the PDF\u2019s education and research skills or paid as income in consideration of various services provided by the PDF to the University.\nV. ANALYSIS Weight of certain evidence\n[25] On a preliminary note, the evidence of the witnesses was reliable and not meaningfully disputative, with one limited exception. Occasionally, in examination, Dr. Lanery, while not a party, transformed from witness to advocate in the area of the CBA and the CBU. Certain simple questions on cross-examination became protracted. Ultimately, this was of no consequence. The CBA did not legally include PDFs, such as Dr. Lanery, until September, 2020. By then, her term as a PDF and the period had ended. To the extent answers were otherwise advocated by the witness, the Court has appropriately weighted them, as it indicated it may be required to do to the witness and counsel during testimony.\nSource of funds\n[26] The Court now considers the evidence and the scalable factors to determine the dominant purpose and characteristic of the payments.\n[27] The University was avidly concerned with the source of funds for the payments. It engaged the PDF to apply for the funds. It reflected the sources, perhaps in its own internal code, but nonetheless, of the funds. And, if and when a potential risk to such full funding from any particular source arose, its financial administrative staff, in conjunction with faculty, filled the gap with alternative moneys from other funding sources.\nControl of work product\n[28] The control and ownership of the PDF\u2019s work product, whatever it came to be, always resided with the PDF. This was enumerated in the original agreement. The language merely reserved a limited licence to use such PDF owned IP in furtherance of the University\u2019s role as educational institution. There was no other evidence of a tangible benefit to the University, save for some collaborative contribution to a website platform development. Limited evidence was before the Court as to whether that contribution related to a non-academic skill set or a collaboration. In any event, from the evidence, the website work product comprised a comparatively limited amount of effort.\nSupervision and control\n[29] The supervisory and academic environment was very much \u201cfree style\u201d. The Minister\u2019s reply referred to the Vice President Research as the direct supervisor of the PDF. Not a scintilla of evidence confirmed this. His name may have been mentioned once in passing. Dr. Lanery\u2019s evidence itself conjured an overall laissez -faire approach to reporting: verbal when desired by the PDF at meetings held once a week; to attendance: there was no requirement; to absences: no need to justify unless for weeks a time; and, to evaluations: there were none. The constraints imposed on Dr. Lanery, by her own testimony, were self-imposed based upon her view of the University\u2019s unexpressed requirements, needs and expectations. The witnesses, best positioned to enumerate their views of such worker constraints concerning control, suggested the University sought no real control.\nIntention of the parties from the agreement\n[30] The first indication of the intention of the parties is the documents. These specified no obligation of the PDF to provide laboratory, tutorial, teaching or research assistance to the University. There was no linkage between the \u201caward\u201d and the provision of services or assistance to the University by the PDF. There was no requirement for attendance, presence or academic writing. The organization of the faculty seminars, held once a week, fell and were shared among various PDFs. PDFs and faculty attending the seminars mutually benefitted from the expressed exchange of ideas and discoveries. The ID card issued reflected a category of staff\/faculty, as opposed to student. No witness suggested Dr. Lanery was a student, but this does not contribute to the analysis of the dominant object of the payments. The agreement slightly militates towards the furtherance of education versus benefit to the University.\nIntention of the parties as reflected in actions\n[31] The second source of information concerning intention is the actions of the parties themselves. There is no evidence that services, assistance or activities of Dr. Lanery to University were connected, rendered or provided in consideration of the payments. There simply were no identifiable, direct or measurable services or activities delivered by Dr. Lanery to the University. On this issue of tools, the University provided a library and its associated services and facilities. It also provided the same to faculty, students, staff and alumni, some of whom were employees receiving income and some of whom were not. This benefit was not exclusive, unique or identifiable in relation to services provided by PDFs to the University. The library services are as essential to enhancing learning and research opportunities generally as they would be to any research assistant who is an employee.\n[32] The opportunity to profit\/risk of loss factor itself has an awkward fit. It is susceptible to arguments either way and is dependent upon the time horizon measured. Further, it is simply not relevant in the decision calculus in this appeal.\n[33] In conclusion, the most dominant object of the payments is furtherance of education or research skills for the PDF. The documents, intention, actions and conduct created, reflected and pursued by all actors in this appeal echo one sentiment: the University exhorted its PDFs, and Dr. Lanery in any event, to pursue research, discussion and research in order to enhance Dr. Lanery\u2019s long term academic skills for the benefit of her learning generally.\n[34] From the evidence in this appeal, the Court concludes that the furtherance of her education and research was the dominant object, goal and outcome of the PDF program and also the award payments made to entice Dr. Lanery to do just that during the period.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND COSTS [35] The annual award was paid with the dominant characteristic of furtherance of the education and learning of Dr. Lanery, the PDF, during the period March 1, 2018 to August 31, 2020. Consequently and based on the principles above applied to the evidence, Dr. Lanery was not an employee and the appeal is allowed.\n[36] In keeping with the jurisprudence on CPP and EI appeals, there shall be no costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 25th day of May, 2023.\n\u201cR.S.

ROBERT CHAD,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR ORDER ON COSTS\nSommerfeldt J.\nI. INTRODUCTION\n[1] These Reasons pertain to the award of costs in respect the Appellant\u2019s motion (the \u201cMotion\u201d) to strike that I heard on January 27-28, 2021, in the context of Appeal No. 2017-1458(IT)G.\nII. BACKGROUND\n[2] On January 27-28, 2021, by video conference, I heard the Motion, brought by the Appellant, S. Robert Chad, for an order to strike out or expunge a significant number of provisions (the \u201cImpugned Provisions\u201d) from the Respondent\u2019s Second Amended Reply. The Impugned Provisions, which were grouped into five categories, were numerous and extensive. I dismissed the Motion with respect to all but two of the Impugned Provisions, on the ground that the Appellant was precluded from bringing the Motion by reason of section 8 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d), commonly referred to as the fresh step rule.\n[3] To the extent that the Motion pertained to the two Impugned Provisions that were beyond the scope of the fresh step rule,[1] that part of the Motion was dismissed in accordance with the Reasons for Order (the \u201cMotion Reasons\u201d) that I issued on July 29, 2021.[2] In the Motion Reasons, notwithstanding that the Motion had been dismissed by reason of the fresh step rule, I also considered the substantive submissions that had been made by counsel for the Appellant and counsel for the Respondent. I noted that the Motion in respect of some of the Impugned Provisions could have been dismissed on other grounds, while the balance of the Motion, which related to other Impugned Provisions, could well have succeeded, but for the fresh step rule.\n[4] In dismissing the Motion, I directed that costs were to be paid by the Appellant to the Respondent. I also provided an opportunity to the Appellant and the Respondent (together, the \u201cParties\u201d) to reach an agreement in respect of costs, failing which they could make written submissions on costs. Being unable to reach an agreement on costs, each of the Parties has provided written submissions to me.\n[5] The Respondent takes the position that an award of enhanced costs, in the amount of $7,210.37 (representing 40% of its solicitor-client fees), should be paid forthwith by the Appellant in any event of the cause. While the Respondent submits that the awarded costs should exceed the amount calculated under the Tariff (which would be $1,400), the Respondent also acknowledges that the circumstances of the Motion do not warrant a recovery of costs on a full-indemnity basis. The Respondent provided affidavit evidence,[3] including copies of the statement of account kept by the Department of Justice (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) for the purpose of recovering the cost of legal services provided by the Department to the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d). On behalf of the Respondent, Stephanie Bourgon stated in her Affidavit that the total fees relating to the Respondent\u2019s response to the Motion were $18,025.93.[4] The Respondent requests costs in an amount equal to 40% of $18,025.93, which is $7,210.37.\n[6] The Appellant submits that there is no reason for the costs to be greater than those that would be calculated under the Tariff, and that the normal or usual practice should be followed here, which, according to the Appellant, is that costs for interlocutory matters are to follow the event. The Appellant did not provide any authority to confirm such a practice.\nIII. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. Rule 147\n[7] Pursuant to subsection 147(1) of the Rules, the Court has an implied discretion to determine the amount of costs to be awarded. The discretion under subsection 147(1) is broad.[5]\n[8] Subsection 147(3) of the Rules states that, in exercising its discretionary power under subsection 147(1), the Court may consider eleven factors, which are listed in subsection 147(3) and which are discussed below (to the extent that they are applicable here).\nB. Tariff B\n[9] It has been indicated that Tariff B, which is set out in Schedule II to the Rules, exists as the default standard for an award of costs.[6] If, in exercising its discretion, the Court decides to depart from the Tariff, the Court must exercise its discretion on a principled basis, without caprice, and having regard to the relevant factors set out in section 147 of the Rules.[7] Where the Court is inclined to depart from the Tariff in awarding costs, the ultimate goal should be to make an award that is fair and reasonable to the parties, while recognizing the success of the successful party.[8]\n[10] In recent years, a number of decisions of this Court have established that, even in a situation where there are no unusual or exceptional circumstances of misconduct or malfeasance, the Court is not bound to defer to the Tariff.[9] In other words, increased costs beyond the Tariff are not tied to exceptional circumstances, such as misconduct, malfeasance or undue delay.[10] While earlier decisions of this Court suggested that there should not be a departure from Tariff costs unless justified by special circumstances,[11] the jurisprudence has evolved since that time, particularly so as to give greater recognition to the work involved in tax litigation, as a factor in awarding costs.[12]\n[11] In discussing the place of the Tariff in a determination of costs, Justice Boyle stated the following in Univar:\n49. \u2026 The Tariff in our rule is not a starting point: it is only a default absent a Rule 147 determination otherwise being made, or an available option, in full or in part to the judge if a Rule 147 determination is being made. Our Tariff is not the starting point in a costs determination. It is the default if no costs determination is made, and it may be used as, or as part of, a costs determination\u2026.\n50. The notion that a principled basis or reason is necessary for me to depart from Tariff sounds like a throwback to the \u2026 Continental Bank era when it was oft stated that costs at Tariff were appropriate unless there were exceptional circumstances. As described earlier in these reasons and in the cases cited above like Velcro Canada Inc.[,] Daishowa-Marubeni, Sommerer, Blackburn Radio Inc., Teeluksingh and Spruce Credit that statement was wrong given the clear construction of our Court\u2019s Rule 147\u2026.[13]\nC. Costs of Motions\n[12] In the context of motions or other interlocutory proceedings, the general common law rule is that costs are typically paid at the conclusion of the litigation.[14] This rule has been followed in some jurisdictions in Canada, while in other jurisdictions in Canada the costs of an interlocutory motion are generally payable forthwith to the successful party.[15] A court may direct that costs of an interlocutory motion be payable forthwith for several purposes, including to discourage interlocutory applications that are frivolous or without merit, or to enforce compliance with the court\u2019s rules and orders, or where otherwise appropriate.[16] In Axton v. Kent, the Ontario Divisional Court stated:\nIt is a salutary practice to order costs payable forthwith on interlocutory matters unless the justice of the case suggests otherwise.[17]\n[13] The relevant portion of subsection 147(5) of the Rules states:\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, the Court has the discretionary power,\n(a) to award or refuse costs in respect of a particular \u2026 part of a proceeding,\n(b) to \u2026 award taxed costs up to and for a particular stage of a proceeding\u2026.\n[14] Justice Smith may have had the above provisions in mind when he stated:\nAs confirmed by section 147 of the Rules, costs can be awarded by the Court at any point in the proceedings in the exercise of its discretionary powers.[18]\nConsequently, after hearing and dismissing motions brought by two appellants, Justice Smith determined the respective amounts of costs to be paid by those appellants, and ordered that those costs were \u201cpayable forthwith\u201d.[19]\n[15] Other examples of cases decided by this Court in respect of costs pertaining to motions, where the costs were ordered to be paid forthwith, are Giannakouras,[20] Ruland Realty Limited [21] and Foroglou.[22]\nIV. ANALYSIS\nA. Application of Rule 147(3) Factors\n[16] The factors set out in subsection 147(3) of the Rules are considered below.\n(1) Rule 147(3)(a): Result of the Motion [17] The Motion was dismissed, i.e., the Respondent was entirely successful. However, it should be noted that the Appellant did succeed in identifying several assumptions of fact in the Respondent\u2019s Second Amended Reply that contained conclusions of law.[23] Nevertheless, by reason of the fresh step rule, I did not strike out the subparagraphs of the Second Amended Reply that contained conclusions of law.\n(2) Rule 147(3)(b): Amounts in Issue [18] The Appeal itself relates primarily to a disallowance by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) of a non-capital loss in the amount of $22,184,108.67, which the Appellant had deducted in computing his income for 2011. Initially, the Appeal also related to a capital loss in the amount of $6,289,014.93, which the Appellant had taken into consideration in computing his income for 2011. At the hearing of the Motion on January 27-28, 2021, the Respondent advised the Court that the Minister had decided to allow the capital loss.\n[19] The Motion identified numerous provisions that the Appellant sought to have struck from the Second Amended Reply. With respect to the assumptions of fact that had been pleaded by the Respondent in paragraph 15 (which contains 68 subparagraphs) of the Second Amended Reply, the Appellant sought to strike out some or all of 16 of those subparagraphs (representing almost a quarter of the subparagraphs setting out the assumptions of fact). In addition, the Appellant sought to strike out the words purported and purportedly from sixteen subparagraphs or clauses of paragraph 15 of the Second Amended Reply and from ten other paragraphs of the Second Amended Reply. Apart from seeking to strike out many of the assumptions of fact, the Appellant also sought to strike out all or part of six other provisions of the Second Amended Reply.\n(3) Rule 147(3)(c): Importance of the Issues [20] A significant portion of the Motion aimed at striking out many of the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and the Respondent\u2019s pleaded provisions that related to the Respondent\u2019s sham argument, which the Respondent states is one of his primary arguments. Accordingly, the Respondent takes the position that the issues considered during the hearing of the Motion were of high importance.[24]\n[21] The Appellant rightly notes that, for the purposes of paragraph 147(3)(c) of the Rules, the relevant question pertains to the importance of the issues raised in the Motion, and not the importance of the issues pertaining to the merits of the Appeal. However, the Appellant does not actually make any submission concerning the importance of the issues considered in the Motion. In the absence of any specific submissions by the Appellant on this point, I will simply note that the fact that the Appellant brought the Motion likely indicates that the Appellant considered the issues raised therein to be important.\n(4) Rule 147(3)(d): Any Written Offer of Settlement [22] There was no written offer of settlement, although the Appellant inquired by email as to whether the Respondent was willing to consent to any portion of the Motion, to which the Respondent declined, also by email.\n[23] The Respondent followed through with an earlier indication that it would concede the capital loss argument. The Parties ultimately signed a Consent to Partial Disposition of Appeal, and a Partial Judgment was issued on March 17, 2021.\n(5) Rule 147(3)(e): Volume of Work [24] The Appellant sought to strike out numerous provisions from the Respondent\u2019s Second Amended Reply. The hearing of the Motion required a day and half. The Respondent has advised that the Department\u2019s lawyers spent a total of 72.14 hours responding to the Motion.[25]\n[25] Concerning the volume-of-work factor, the Appellant submits that \u201cThe volume of work with respect to the Motion was hardly substantial nor did it warrant an important investment of time by the Respondent.\u201d[26] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s submission concerning the volume of work, particularly as I was required to spend many hours myself, endeavoring to ascertain the connection that the Appellant was trying to make between several interlocutory orders granted by Justice Favreau in respect of this Appeal and the arguments put forth by the Appellant as to why various provisions of the Second Amended Reply should therefore be struck out. Being cognizant of the amount of time that I was required to spend in understanding and deciding the Motion, I can appreciate the number of hours spent by counsel for the Respondent in responding to the Motion.\n(6) Rule 147(3)(f): Complexity of the Issues [26] The Appellant\u2019s attack on the Impugned Provisions raised arguments that may be grouped into five categories, as follows:\n(a) allegations of sham;\n(b) conclusions of law intermingled with the assumptions of fact;\n(c) a provision allegedly disregarding a previous court order;\n(d) incorrect assumptions that were corrected during discovery; and\n(e) abandoned arguments.\n[27] The Appellant\u2019s submissions in respect of the allegations of sham required an analysis of the concept of a judicial admission and the doctrine of issue estoppel. To understand the Appellant\u2019s attack on paragraph 5.1 and subparagraph 5.2(b) of the Second Amended Reply, it was necessary for the Respondent (as well as for me) to review several orders granted by Justice Favreau in 2020, and then to analyze the alleged connection between those orders and the Appellant\u2019s arguments for striking out paragraph 5.1 and a portion of subparagraph 5.2(b) of the Second Amended Reply. Based on the complexity that I encountered in that exercise, I accept the Respondent\u2019s representation that the Motion had \u201ca reasonable level of complexity.\u201d[27]\n[28] The Appellant\u2019s representation in respect of the complexity factor is set out below:\nThe Respondent recognized that \u201cThe majority of the Motion was disposed [of] on the basis of the fresh step rule, the application of which was easily determinable.\u201d That being so, there is no level of complexity warranting enhanced costs.[28]\n[29] The first three words of the last sentence quoted above could be read in either of two ways. I am not sure whether the Appellant was merely saying that the Respondent had made a submission to the effect that the application of the fresh step rule was easily determinable, or whether the Appellant was actually concurring with the Respondent that the application of the fresh step rule was easily determinable. As the Appellant began the above statement by saying that the Respondent \u201crecognized\u201d (rather than saying that the Respondent \u201csubmitted\u201d or \u201csuggested\u201d) that the application of the fresh step rule was easily determinable, for the purposes of these Reasons, it seems that perhaps one might view the Appellant\u2019s statement as indicating that the Appellant, like the Respondent, acknowledged that the application of the fresh step rule was easily determinable. However, as I am not certain that this was the Appellant\u2019s intended meaning, for the purposes of these Reasons, I do not consider the Appellant to have conceded that the application of the fresh step rule was easily determinable.\n[30] The only representation made by the Appellant in respect of the complexity factor relates to the fresh step rule. The Appellant did not make any representations in respect of the complexity of the issues raised by the five categories of Impugned Provisions listed in paragraph 26 above.\n(7) Rule 147(3)(g): Conduct of the Parties affecting the Duration of the Proceeding [31] As noted in paragraphs 28 and 29 and footnote 28 above, the Respondent states that the majority of the Motion was disposed of on the basis of the fresh step rule, whose application was easily determinable. The Respondent also submits that the duration of the Motion was lengthened by reason of the Appellant\u2019s attempts to use the Respondent\u2019s efforts at uncovering an inappropriate claim by the Appellant for solicitor-client privilege, in order to strike out the Respondent\u2019s sham argument.\n[32] The Appellant submits that the conduct-of-the-parties factor is a non-issue.\n[33] From my perspective, as the motion judge, I had no concern about the conduct of counsel for either Party during the hearing of the Motion, as all counsel conducted themselves professionally and courteously, and did nothing during the hearing that tended to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding.[29]\n[34] However, as noted in footnote 10 of the Motion Reasons, the Appellant should have sought leave of the Court, under section 8 of the Rules, before bringing the Motion. This would have raised the fresh step rule at the outset, such that it might not have been necessary to address the many other issues that were raised at at the hearing of the Motion, as formulated.\n(8) Rule 147(3)(h): Failure to Make Admissions [35] I am not aware of any denial, neglect or refusal by either Party to admit anything that should have been admitted in respect of the Motion.\n(9) Rule 147(3)(i): Improper, Vexatious, Unnecessary or Overly Cautious Steps [36] In my view, the Motion was not vexatious or taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution.\n[37] The Respondent submits that the Appellant, in a sense, misused Justice Favreau\u2019s order, relating to efforts by the Respondent to uncover an inappropriate claim by the Appellant for solicitor-client privilege, as a basis to move to strike out portions of the Second Amended Reply pertaining to the Respondent\u2019s sham argument. The Respondent submits that this aspect of the Motion served no purpose but to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding.\n[38] The Appellant submits that the Respondent did not claim during the hearing of the Motion, or during any other relevant stage in the proceedings, that the Motion was improper, vexatious, unnecessary or taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution.\n[39] In my view, it was inappropriate for the Appellant to make the Motion without first seeking leave of the Court, as contemplated by section 8 of the Rules. Had such leave been sought, it likely would not have been granted, meaning that the Motion, for the most part, would likely have been unnecessary.[30]\n(10) Rule 147(3)(i.1): Expense in Respect of an Expert Witness [40] No expert witness gave evidence in the context of the Motion. Accordingly, this factor is not relevant.\n(11) Rule 147(3)(j): Other Relevant Matters [41] The Respondent submits that the amount of costs requested, i.e., $7,210.37, represents an amount which the Appellant could reasonably expect to pay if unsuccessful on the Motion.[31] On the other hand, the Appellant submits that the \u201camount sought by the Respondent is simply not reasonable for the unsuccessful Motion.\u201d[32]\n[42] Both Parties concur that the amount of costs, if calculated in accordance with the Tariff, would be $1,400.\n[43] Paragraph 12 of the Affidavit indicates that the Respondent\u2019s total fees for the Motion were in the amount of $18,025.93. That paragraph of the Affidavit contains a partial breakdown of the computation of those fees, showing the fiscal year (2020-03-31 to 2021-03-31), the classification levels (LP-2, LP-3 and LP-4) of the various lawyers who worked on this matter, their respective hourly rates and the number of hours worked by the lawyers in the various classification levels. Although paragraph 12 of the Affidavit does not provide the dates on which specific legal services were provided, a description of those services, or the names of the lawyers who provided the services, Exhibit \u201cE\u201d to the Affidavit has been annotated so as to identify the time docket entries (including names of lawyers, hours worked, dates and descriptions of services rendered) that relate to the work performed in respect of the Motion. The hourly rates charged by the Department\u2019s lawyers who worked on the Motion were modest and reasonable.\nV. CONCLUSION [44] For the reasons expressed above, it is my view that costs in an amount greater than that determined under the Tariff should be awarded to the Respondent. However, as the Appellant did succeed in identifying several assumptions of fact in the Second Amended Reply that contained conclusions of law, it is my view that the amount of costs claimed by the Respondent, i.e., $7,210.37, should be discounted slightly. Accordingly, costs in the amount of $7,000 are awarded to the Respondent, payable by the Appellant on or before July 31, 2023.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 29th day of May 2023.\n\u201cDon R.

Introduction: [1] The appellant, Yin Li, appeals denial under the federal Income Tax Act (Act) of claimed employment expenses of $55,945 and $50,793 respectively for his 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\n[2] For each year Mr. Li claimed three categories of employment expenses, being:\n(a) $24,000 assistant\u2019s salary for a non-arm\u2019s length family member for each of 2015 and 2016;\n(b) motor vehicle expenses for 2015 totaling $15,857 for auto lease and parking, $7,240 for fuel and $5,998 for insurance; and for 2016 totaling $14,558 for auto lease and parking, $6,850 for fuel and $5,385 for insurance; and\n(c) office supplies (being an Apple Watch and an Apple laptop) totaling $2,850 for the 2016 taxation year.\n[3] At all relevant times Mr. Li resided with his wife, mother-in-law and children at his home in the GTA.\n[4] During his 2015 and 2016 taxation years, Mr. Li was employed by a numbered Ontario corporation that owned and operated an automobile dealership in Toronto. Mr. Li concurrently held two senior positions at that dealership - General Sales Manager and Financial Services Manager.\n[5] In these two years he annually earned employment income in the $110,000 range, including annual commission income in the $75,000 range.\nII. Legislation: [6] Section 8 of the Act addresses deductible employment expenses. Subsection 8(2) prohibits employment expense deductions other than those provided for in section 8.\n[7] Paragraph 8(1)(h.1), subparagraph 8(1)(i)(ii) and subsection 8(10) of the Act provide in relevant part (underlining added):\n8(1): Deductions allowed: In computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment, there may be deducted such of the following amounts as are wholly applicable to that source or such part of the following amounts as may reasonably be regarded as applicable thereto\u2026\n(h.1) motor vehicle travel expenses: where the taxpayer, in the year,\n(i) was ordinarily required to carry on the duties of the office or employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business or in different places, and\n(ii) was required under the contract of employment to pay motor vehicle expenses incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, amounts expended by the taxpayer in the year in respect of motor vehicle expenses incurred for traveling in the course of the office or employment, except where the taxpayer\n(iii) received an allowance for motor vehicle expenses that was, because of paragraph 6(1)(b), not included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year, or\n(iv) claims deduction for the year under paragraph 8(1)(f);\n(i) dues and other expenses of performing duties: an amount paid by the taxpayer in the year\u2026as\u2026\n(ii) office rent, or salary to an assistant or substitute, the payment of which by the officer or employee was required by the contract of employment,\n8(10): Certificate of employer: An amount otherwise deductible for a taxation year under paragraph (1)(c), (f), (h) or (h.1) or subparagraph (1)(i)(ii) or (iii) by a taxpayer shall not be deducted unless a prescribed form, signed by the taxpayer\u2019s employer certifying that the conditions set out in the applicable provision were met in the year in respect of the taxpayer, is filed with the taxpayer\u2019s return of income for the year.\nIII. Assistants\u2019 Salaries: [8] The first of the three noted expense claim categories is the expense claim for $24,000 for each of the two years as a salary for an assistant. In 2015 he engaged his mother-in-law, who lived in the same household, to do certain work using a home laptop computer with VPN connection to his office files. The work was to complete and close the file on each vehicle sale, lease or financing as they occurred, which included entry of confidential information of customers and of the dealership, before the completed file was conveyed to the dealership\u2019s accountant.\n[9] Mr. Li testified that with his two senior jobs at the dealership he did not have time to do this work himself, and that he needed someone, such as his mother\u2011in-law whom he could fully trust with this sensitive information, to complete the required closing of each transactional file, prior to submission to the dealership\u2019s accountant for posting. His mother-in -law did this work from home. There were busy and slow times during the automotive year and the work could take a varying number of part-time hours per week to complete. She understandably was slow at it at first but in time more quickly completed the file closures.\n[10] Mr. Li claimed a deduction of $24,000 of his 2015 employment income for salary paid to his mother-in-law for this work. He testified that he did not pay his mother-in-law the $2,000 per month. He instead credited the amount against monthly rent for her living in his house, and against food charges and transportation charges to her and unspecified credit card or other charges. No documentation corroborating such crediting was entered in evidence. The amount of the purported monthly rent was not stated, and Mr. Li\u2019s mother-in-law did not testify. No records as to hours worked were maintained. The evidence was that she was not paid by the hour.\n[11] It was suggested in cross-examination that his mother-in-law\u2019s knowledge of English was poor, to which Mr. Li responded that she had had some ESL training and that the work he had her do did not involve knowing the English language so much as just being able to add and subtract.\n[12] In 2016 this was repeated except in that year his assistant was his wife. It was explained that in 2015 she had not done this work as she had had a baby in July of that year. Her remuneration also was $2,000 per month, i.e., $24,000 in total. Again, no records were provided as to hours worked.\n[13] His wife was paid by way of the monthly amounts of $2,000 being in a joint account held by both spouses. Mr. Li was asked on cross-examination, \u201cIs it correct that you paid your wife through a joint account and that there was no actual transfer of funds?\u201d Mr. Li answered, \u201cCorrect.\u201d[1]\n[14] Mr. Li\u2019s wife did not testify. As with 2015, no records as to payment or as to hours worked were kept or in any event entered in evidence for this 2016 work.\n[15] Subsection 8(10) and subparagraph 8(1)(i)(ii) of the Act together provide that deduction for salary paid to an assistant requires that payment by the employee of the salary to an assistant be required by the employee\u2019s employment contract and also that a completed form T2200 (headed \u201cDeclaration of Conditions of Employment\u201d) be filed.\n[16] There is no evidence that Mr. Li\u2019s employment contract required that he pay a salary to an assistant. As well, neither of the T2200 forms for the two taxation years entered in evidence was, \u201csigned by the taxpayer\u2019s employer\u201d as subsection 8(10) explicitly requires. There was no evidence or suggestion that signed versions of same had been filed with Mr. Li\u2019s return for either of these two taxation years.\n[17] As well no documentary evidence was submitted, supporting actual payment of the alleged $24,000 salary for 2015 and 2016 respectively.\n[18] Does depositing the monthly amount into a joint account constitute a payment from one of the joint account holders to the other? In Blott v. Her Majesty, 2018 TCC 1, this situation was addressed. As to whether this constituted payment for purposes of subparagraph 8(1)(i)(ii), C. Miller J. wrote (paras. 11, 13):\n11. So, was $12,000 paid\u2026by Mr. Blott? There are no cheques to [Mr. Blott\u2019s spouse] Ms. Th\u00e9riault. Mr. Blott\u2019s income went into the joint account and Ms. Th\u00e9riault could simply access it. Is there any amount paid to Ms. Th\u00e9riault in such circumstances? I conclude there is not. Granted, Ms. Th\u00e9riault, as a joint holder of the account, could withdraw whatever she wanted, well in excess of $12,000 a year for that matter. Indeed, she and Mr. Blott could withdraw everything from the account. In these circumstances, I do not see how anything has been paid or expended to Ms. Th\u00e9riault. She has received nothing more than what she already had.\n13. To establish a working employer\/employee relationship in a non-arm\u2019s length situation, it is important that there be some evidence of a salary being paid, some evidence that the recipient of a wage has in fact received a benefit beyond what might arise in the ordinary course of a husband and wife sharing a joint account. Further, Mr. Blott provided no T4 for his wife. On balance, I conclude no salary was paid as contemplated by the Act, to Ms. Th\u00e9riault. (underlining added)\n[19] Thus, the answer in Blott was that having the salary amount put in a joint account held by the two spouses did not constitute payment from spouse A of a salary to spouse B qua assistant. I likewise so find in Mr. Li\u2019s situation vis-a-vis payment in 2016 of a salary to his wife as an assistant.\n[20] As for the crediting of amounts against his mother-in-law\u2019s expenses, there was no evidence submitted confirming that these payments were credited against such expenses. Nor was there any evidence that normally Mr. Li charged his mother-in-law for rent, food and transportation, etc.\n[21] In Burlando v. Her Majesty, 2014 TCC 92, V. Miller J. of this Court observed (paras. 12, 13, 16):\n12. There was no documentary evidence to support that the appellant paid Bonita any wages. His testimony that he paid her by setting off her wages against the amount she charged on his credit card was not supported by any receipts. It is my opinion that he randomly chose amounts from his bank statements and stated these amounts were Bonita\u2018s wages. For instance, some months he included his daughter\u2019s gym membership as part of Bonita\u2018s wages and other months the gym membership was not included as part of her wages. In 2008, the items he chose as Bonita\u2018s wages totaled $21,407.60 and in 2009 the items totaled $17,204.72. There were no documents to support that the credit card charges, the debit card payments or the cash withdrawals were made by Bonita.\n13. Counsel for the appellant stated that the circumstances of this appeal were similar to those in Noel v. R., 2011 TCC 27 (TCC [general procedure]). I disagree. In Noel, Hogan J. of this Court found that Ms. Noel had the skills to perform the duties for which she was responsible and that she was paid by cheque for her services to her spouse\u2019s law firm. It was never an issue whether Ms. Noel actually worked in her spouse\u2019s business.\n16. In conclusion, it is my view that the appellant has not satisfied the onus on him of showing that the reassessment was incorrect. He has not shown that Bonita actually worked for him or that he paid her any wages. In a situation such as existed in this appeal, where there is an alleged working relationship between non-arms length parties, there should have been some documentation or independent evidence to support that working relationship. In this case neither was given. (underlining added)\n[22] Following Burlando, and given the absence of documentary evidence here, plus also the lack of testimony from Mr. Li\u2019s mother-in-law, I am unable to conclude that the monthly $2,000 amounts were actually \u201cpaid\u201d to Mr. Li\u2019s mother-in-law. As well and as stated there is no evidence that the purportedly credited charges such as for rent, food and transportation were charges that Mr. Li otherwise or normally required his mother\u2011in\u2011law to pay.\n[23] As well, I question the reasonableness of these payments. How was the annual amount of $24,000 determined? It was not based on number of hours. In his direct examination Mr. Li was asked why the payment was $24,000. Mr. Li answered that, \u201cThat\u2019s what we predetermined, $2,000 a month to my wife.\u201d[2]\n[24] In the absence of evidence indicating otherwise, the $24,000 for each of the two years strikes me as being an arbitrary amount and overly generous for part\u2011time hours of computer laptop work throughout the year. I conclude that the annual $24,000 of salary was not reasonable in amount for either year.\n[25] Finally, in establishing that Mr. Li\u2019s mother-in-law and wife had done the claimed work, they should have testified. For this to be a valid basis for deducting an employment expense for each of the two years, records needed to be kept and produced and payments needed to be actually made and be reasonable in total amount. As well, as noted above, this employment expense of paying a salary to an assistant was not supported as required by a subsection 8(10) form T2200 signed by the appellant\u2019s employer; nor was payment of such salary by Mr. Li provided for in Mr. Li\u2019s own contract of employment.\n[26] Accordingly, each of the two years of claimed annual deduction of $24,000 as salary is denied.\nIV. Motor vehicle expenses: [27] The second category of claimed expenses is motor vehicle expenses. In this regard Mr. Li claimed lease charges, insurance, fuel and parking for each of two vehicles - a BMW and a Toyota.\n[28] In the course of cross\u2011examination, he conceded that the Toyota related charges (lease and parking, insurance, fuel) should be excluded as that vehicle was used basically for pleasure.\n[29] As for the BMW he ultimately conceded that 50% of related charges were personal and not for business, and thus should not have been claimed. As well he did not have a mileage log for the BMW. As for fuel and parking, he brought no receipts re same to Court.\n[30] The 50% for business was for the round trip of 20 kilometres that he testified he had to drive almost every day from the dealership to a provincial vehicle licensing office, to arrange for prompt licensing of vehicles the dealership had just sold, leased or financed. He insisted he needed to do this as someone less senior would not have the authority and knowledge to authorize amendments while at the licensing office in regard to questions and situations that could arise.\n[31] He testified also that there were other business errands to be run using the BMW but did not specify what they were. This 50% of business usage was just a round estimate on his part, in the course of the hearing. I am left unpersuaded that these 20 kilometres per day plus occasional other errands added up to 50% of total usage being business usage. For each such day he also would commute to the dealership from his home in the GTA, which of course is not business driving. The BMW also was used for recreational purposes. As above stated, there was no mileage log to consult. Also as stated there were no fuel or parking receipts entered in evidence.\n[32] Mr. Li received a monthly motor vehicle allowance of $400, totalling $4,800 annually for each of the two relevant taxation years, included in his T4s for these years.\n[33] In cross-examination Mr. Li agreed with the assertion that he had, \u201cclaimed [his] entire family\u2019s fuel expenses\u201d. He said this was because, \u201cmy family members [were] also partly involved in my work\u201d.[3] The only evidence in this regard was that his mother\u2011in-law and wife had carried out the above discussed computer laptop work at home, with no requirement for driving anywhere. Accordingly, there was no justification for claiming total fuel charges.\n[34] Motor vehicle expenses are claimable under paragraph 8(1)(h.1), set out above. But, per subsection 8(10), above, such expenses can only be claimed if provided for in a form T2200 \u201cDeclaration of conditions of employment\u201d signed by or on behalf of the employer. There is in evidence no T2200 that was signed by the employer.\n[35] For these reasons, the claimed motor vehicle expenses cannot be deducted.\nV. Office supplies: [36] Finally, under the heading \u201coffice supplies\u201d, Mr. Li sought deduction for expenses incurred to purchase an Apple watch and Apple laptop computer. Both were considered computers.\n[37] Apart from the question as to personal usage of, in particular the Apple Watch, both claimed Apple products are viewed by the respondent to be capital assets, and hence not deductible as claimed. I agree. Thus, the deduction of the actual expense in procuring each of these two items is denied.\nVI. Conclusion: [38] The appeal of the respective January 14, 2019 reassessments for Mr. Li\u2019s 2015 and 2016 taxation years will be dismissed.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 25th day of May 2023.\n\u201cB.

INTRODUCTION A. Context\n[1] The Appellant (\u201cJohn Doe\u201d) worked for RBC Dominion Securities in Vancouver, British Columbia until July 9, 2015.[1]\n[2] On December 13, 2013, John Doe filed an appeal in respect of his 2005 and 2006 taxation years. The Minister reassessed John Doe to deny business and employment expenses claimed by John Doe in both taxation years. The total amount of expenses at issue for 2005 and 2006 are $250,813.33 and $178,602.92, respectively.\n[3] On July 16, 2015, John Doe filed an appeal in respect of his 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years. The Minister assessed John Doe on the basis that he did not file his income tax returns for 2009, 2010 or 2011. The Minister assessed John Doe for owing federal and provincial taxes, penalties and arrears totalling $124,850.55, $117,759.90 and $112,107.35 for his 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years, respectively.\n[4] On August 30, 2019, John Doe filed an appeal in respect of his 2014 taxation year. The notice of appeal does not provide any details on the issue(s) in dispute or the facts that John Doe intends to rely on. The Court is not aware of the amount of tax at issue for the 2014 taxation year.\n[5] On November 21, 2019, John Doe filed an appeal in respect of his 2015 and 2016 taxation years. The notice of appeal does not provide any details on the issue(s) in dispute or the facts that John Doe intends to rely on. The Court is not aware of the amount of tax at issue for the 2015 and 2016 taxation years.\nB. Proceedings on Behalf of a Party Under Legal Disability in the Tax Court of Canada\n[6] Pursuant to section 29.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure)[2] (the \u201cTax Court Rules\u201d), unless the Court orders otherwise, the representative of a party under a legal disability shall institute or continue a proceeding on behalf of that party.\n[7] Pursuant to section 30 of the Tax Court Rules, unless the Court orders otherwise, a person who is the representative of a party under a legal disability in a proceeding shall be represented by counsel, except where that person is also counsel acting in such a capacity.\n[8] Consequently, pursuant to the Tax Court Rules, if John Doe is under a legal disability, he should be represented by counsel in all proceedings related to his appeals in the Tax Court of Canada.\nC. The Issue\n[9] The Court believes that John Doe might be under a legal disability based on numerous facts. These facts are the following:\n-John Doe has struggled with his mental health since at least 2012.[3] Since March 2013, John Doe has been receiving treatment for bipolar affective disorder from Dr. Babra Rana (\u201cDr. Rana\u201d), a psychiatrist at Burnaby Mental Health and Substance Use Services.[4]\n-Since 2013, John Doe has been an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act[5] of British Columbia.\n-John Doe lives in the community but has been hospitalized several times since 2012.[6]\n-Since 2013, John Doe has instituted four appeals with this Court with respect to the 2005, 2006, 2009 to 2011 and 2014 to 2016 taxation years. John Doe filed his first appeal in this Court on December 13, 2013. He has represented himself in all four appeals.\n-Since 2013, the progress of John Doe\u2019s appeals has been impeded by a number of factors, which include John Doe\u2019s numerous adjournment requests for medical reasons and adjournments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the adjournment requests for medical reasons were made by John Doe, by Dr. Rana or by a member of her team at Burnaby Mental Health and Substance Use Services.\n-Prior to January 2016, John Doe had informed the Court that he had been hospitalized, but he did not say why.[7] As a result, there was no reason for the Court to question John Doe\u2019s capacity to handle his appeals before then.\n-It was in January 2016 that the Court first became aware of John Doe\u2019s diagnosis and hospitalizations. During the following years, the Court received a total of ten letters from Dr. Rana and her team. These letters explained John Doe\u2019s diagnosis and symptoms and were always submitted in support of a request for an adjournment. The adjournment requests were made because John Doe was not well and\/or because John Doe needed time to recover, leading the Court to believe that he would recover eventually and therefore be able to represent himself in all of his appeals. Over the years, the content of these letters allowed the Court to gradually obtain more details on the nature and severity of John Doe\u2019s condition and on the impact that it may have on his ability to carry on his appeals.\n-Despite the numerous adjournment requests, the Court was able to hold status hearings, in person, in order to monitor the progress of John Doe\u2019s appeals. John Doe appeared at five of those hearings. He did not appear at two of them and on at least one occasion, it was because he was hospitalized. When he did appear, John Doe\u2019s participation was minimal and at times, he was barely responsive.\n[10] On the basis of these facts, the Court has concluded that if John Doe\u2019s appeals are to proceed, the Court must first determine whether he is under a legal disability.\nII. THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS [11] The relevant statutory provisions are as follows:\nTax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a\nProceeding on Behalf of Party Under Legal Disability\n29.1 Unless the Court orders otherwise, the representative of a party under a legal disability shall institute or continue a proceeding on behalf of that party.\nRepresentation by Counsel\n30(1) Subject to subsection (3), a party to a proceeding who is an individual may act in person or be represented by counsel.\n(2) Where a party to a proceeding is not an individual, that party shall be represented by counsel except with leave of the Court and on any conditions that it may determine.\n(3) Unless the Court orders otherwise, a person who is the representative of a party under a legal disability in a proceeding shall be represented by counsel, except where that person is also counsel acting in such a capacity.\nSupreme Court Civil Rules, BC Reg 168\/2009\nRule 20-2 \u2014 Persons under Disability\n1.

THE FACTS A. Summary of the Proceedings\n[12] The facts summarized below were taken into consideration by the Court for issuing this Order.\n2016 [13] On January 5, 2016, the Respondent filed a motion to quash John Doe\u2019s appeal with respect to the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years on the basis that John Doe had not met the requirements in order to file a valid appeal.[8] The hearing of the motion was scheduled for January 29, 2016, in Vancouver.\n[14] On January 22, 2016, the Court was made aware of the nature of John Doe\u2019s hospitalization. Counsel for the Respondent advised the Court that John Doe had left her a voicemail indicating that he was under the influence of medicine and had sent her a completed \u201cNotification to Involuntary Patient of Rights under the Mental Health Act\u201d form dated December 24, 2015.[9] Counsel for the Respondent stated that John Doe did not appear to be in the hospital at the time. The Court decided to proceed with the scheduled hearing. At the hearing, John Doe repeatedly told the Court that he was mentally disabled and on extended leave from Burnaby Mental Health and Substance Use Services. He described his condition as \u201cbipolar\u201d, \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cmania\u201d and told the Court that he had been admitted to a mental hospital at leave five times since 2012 for his mental illnesses. He also expressed his desire to hire counsel to assist him with his appeals. The Court adjourned the hearing for 90 days to give John Doe an opportunity to retain counsel.\n[15] On February 19, 2016, John Doe informed the Court that he was not capable of proceeding with his appeals because of his health and requested a three-month adjournment. John Doe provided the Court a letter from Dr. Rana and Wendy Isley (\u201cMs. Isley\u201d), Case Manager at Burnaby Mental Health and Substance Use Services, which stated the following:\nWe are writing at the request of the above named client. He has been hospitalized from Dec. 1\/15 until Dec. 18\/15 and then released on extended leave. He is now being closely followed and monitored at our outpatient department every two weeks. His condition is not yet at his baseline; and we recommend that he have a further three month adjournment from any court or legal procedure.[10]\nGiven the circumstances, the Court granted John Doe an adjournment and scheduled a status hearing for May 30, 2016 in order to assess whether there had been any progress with respect to John Doe\u2019s health and whether he had hired counsel.\n[16] On May 20, 2016, John Doe wrote to the Court and requested a three-month adjournment to give him time to recover.[11] He submitted a letter signed by Dr. Rana and Ms. Isley dated April 15, 2016, which stated:\nJohn Doe been [sic] followed by us for several years now, regarding his BiPolar Affective Disorder. He has had difficulty adjusting to his medications causing decreased concentration and focus; and increased hours of sleep to 14 per night. Once he is up he remains sedated for much of the day. He also has decreased motivation and is very anxious. This leaves him little time or ability to attend to his affairs regarding preparation for his pending court case related to his lawsuit with the Canada Revenue Agency.\nWe have requested one extension; and now we are supporting our client\u2019s request to extend same again due to his current cognitive\/mental status. We have also commenced a recent medication change; which will increase the time required for him to stabilize even more.[12]\n[17] On May 25, 2016, counsel for the Respondent advised the Court that she did not oppose John Doe\u2019s adjournment request. Counsel acknowledged that it appeared that John Doe may be unable to act on his own behalf because of his medical condition under section 29.1 and subsection 30(3) of the Tax Court Rules.[13] Counsel also acknowledged that John Doe\u2019s medical condition seems to be preventing him from taking concrete steps to advance his appeals, and requested that the Court require John Doe to take steps to obtain representation so that the appeals could be dealt with in a timely manner.[14] Given the circumstances, the Court adjourned the status hearing scheduled for May 30, 2016 and asked John Doe to obtain a letter from his doctor by June 30, 2016 explaining to the Court when he would be able to retain counsel and to attend to his affairs.[15]\n[18] On June 28, 2016, Ms. Isley wrote to the Court on behalf of Dr. Rana. In her letter, she explained in general terms that John Doe may never recover to the point where he could handle his legal affairs. She stated the following:\nJohn Doe has been followed by us since early March of 2013. He has had a severe mental illness, since 2012, and possible [sic] prior to that but his first known hospitalization was in 2012. Since then, he has not had any reasonable period of time when he was well. Due to his impaired judgement, and very poor insight, he has also stopped his medications at times. As a result he has had repeated hospitalizations and subsequently he has not been able to handle his affairs as his condition severely impairs his judgement, motivation, energy and insight.\nJohn Doe was seen this afternoon, and we are very concerned about his mental health and well being. He is at risk of possible self-harm. We are unable to provide you with a date that this client will be able to retain counsel as he has no income and is still unwell. Would it be possible for a complete adjournment of this case.[16]\n[19] On August 30, 2016, the Court wrote to Dr. Rana and Ms. Isley to inform them that the Court was unable to simply order a complete adjournment as requested. The Court asked Dr. Rana to answer the following questions by September 26, 2016:\n1. Is John Doe legally disabled? If so, who is authorized to represent John Doe and in what capacity?\n\u2026\n2. If John Doe is not legally disabled, is John Doe able to retain counsel and give instructions to counsel in the near future?\n3. If John Doe is not legally disabled and is unable to represent himself or retain counsel, who is authorized to retain counsel on his behalf?[17]\n[20] On September 6, 2016, Dr. Rana replied the following:\nJohn Doe is a person with a mental illness which is cyclical in nature and can recur. During times of recurrence, John Doe\u2019s functioning has been greatly impaired; requiring several hospitalizations during the past three to four years. These have caused him financial hardship.\nJohn Doe may have suffered with this illness for quite some time prior to being diagnosed. This illness frequently causes people to demonstrate poor financial judgement, which often leads them to have significant debts.\nI am not clear on what is meant by legally disabled. John Doe is currently handling his own affairs. He has disclosed that he has no income at this time; and cannot afford to retain counsel.\nJohn Doe would be able to give instructions to counsel when he is well, but he would not be able to give instructions to counsel when he is not well.\nJohn Doe continues to have residual symptoms, and is under significant stress; both of which leave him vulnerable to relapsing.[18]\n2017 [21] The Court scheduled a status hearing for February 21, 2017.\n[22] On January 13, 2017, Dr. Rana wrote to the Court requesting an adjournment of the February 21, 2017 status hearing. Dr. Rana wrote the following:\nAt this time, John Doe continues to be mentally ill. Due to his mental illness John Doe has memory problems, and his judgment is very poor. He is sleeping long hours; and his energy is low. His mood has been depressed with increased anxiety. In addition to this he has very limited money and no income with which to obtain legal assistance.\nEven if he were to obtain Legal Advice or Legal Aid, his thought processing is slowed and disorganized. Overall, at this time I cannot advise as to how long before his condition improves, or if it will improve.[19]\n[23] The Court denied the request to adjourn the status hearing.\n[24] At the February 21, 2017 status hearing, John Doe advised the Court that he had not retained counsel, citing lack of funds,[20] and that he did not have any family member or friend who could assist him in hiring counsel.[21] John Doe knew of Dr. Rana\u2019s letter of January 13, 2017, though he did not seem to understand the substance or consequence of that letter. He did not seem to fully appreciate that his capacity may be an obstacle to his appeals moving forward.[22] At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent submitted to the Court that she was aware of the issue regarding John Doe potentially being under a legal disability, but that she was uncertain about what actions she was authorized to take as counsel for the Respondent.[23] She admitted that, like the Court, she had not encountered this situation before.[24] The Court requested that counsel research the matter and provide the Respondent\u2019s position on how to proceed in light of the fact that the Court believed that John Doe might be legally disabled.[25] The Court suggested that counsel contact the Public Guardian and Trustee of British Columbia (\u201cPGT\u201d) and gather information on how to proceed[26] and urged the Respondent, as a party in these proceedings, to be proactive in assisting John Doe to move these appeals forward.[27] A status hearing was scheduled for March 13, 2017 in order to give counsel sufficient time to make the necessary inquiries and report to the Court at the hearing.\n[25] On March 13, 2017, John Doe appeared at the status hearing and was only able to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a few of the Court\u2019s questions. Otherwise, John Doe did not appear to understand the discussions between the Court and counsel. He repeated to the Court that he needed time to recover.[28] Counsel for the Respondent informed the Court that she had looked into the process set out by the PGT for having a legal guardian appointed for John Doe.[29] Counsel understood that anyone could notify the PGT that a person may be incapable of managing his financial affairs, though often that person was the person\u2019s doctor.[30] Counsel told the Court that she had not had any contact with Dr. Rana to ask whether she was prepared to make the referral.[31] She repeated her concerns regarding counsel for the Respondent being involved in this matter since these were not the Respondent\u2019s appeals and the Respondent was the opposite party.[32] Counsel also did not believe that she was in a position to make a referral to the PGT because she did not have all the relevant details with respect to John Doe\u2019s medical condition.[33] The Court asked counsel to contact Dr. Rana in the hope that she could initiate this process and John Doe acknowledged that he understood that this would be done.[34] The Court scheduled another status hearing for May 30, 2017.\n[26] By letter dated April 3, 2017, Dr. Rana sent a letter to the Court requesting a 12-month adjournment:\nIt is to my understanding that John Doe has his next hearing on May 30th 2017. This is a letter outlining John Doe\u2019s [sic] mental health diagnosis and the limitations he is currently facing at this stage in his recovery.\nJohn Doe is suffering from a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, where he is in early stages of recovery. Due to the number of hospitalizations he has had, the amount of time required for him to stabilize is much greater than if he has had only one acute episode.\nAt this point, John Doe continues to suffer with residual symptoms including poor concentration, decreased energy and slowed thought process. These symptoms impact his ability to focus on what he wants to achieve and significantly decrease his motivation.\nJohn Doe is not at his baseline functioning at this point in time and his current legal affairs are increasing his stress and vulnerabilities to a relapse. After discussion with John Doe, it is my recommendation that he would benefit from 12 months to focus on his own recovery before adequately representing himself in court, as he has declined options for alternative representation. Please consider a 12 month delay in proceeding with this hearing for John Doe to progress in his recovery.\nI am willing to attend his hearing and further answer questions regarding his mental health diagnosis and functional ability at this time if needed.[35]\n[27] Given this letter\u2019s contents, the Court adjourned the scheduled hearing for 12 months. The Court scheduled a status hearing for June 22, 2018.\n2018 [28] On June 19, 2018, Dr. Rana wrote to counsel for the Respondent to request a further six-month adjournment. This letter was forwarded to the Court and states the following:\nJohn Doe is suffering from a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. While John Doe\u2019s condition has improved over the past year, he continues to suffer with residual symptoms, such as impaired concentration, social isolation, and sleep disturbances. In particular, John Doe is significantly distressed by the upcoming Status Hearing, and reports losing sleep, increased anxiety, and poor concentration. His ability to tolerate stress is significantly reduced by his diagnosis, and he remains vulnerable to a relapse.\nIt is my recommendation that John Doe would benefit from a further six month deferral on his appeal in order to continue to work on improving his wellness and mental health.[36]\n[29] The adjournment request was denied by the Court.\n[30] On June 22, 2018, John Doe attended the scheduled status hearing. The Court was not satisfied that John Doe\u2019s condition had improved enough to the point that he could manage his legal affairs. The Court asked counsel for the Respondent to report to the Court with an update in October of 2018 and scheduled another status hearing for January 8, 2019.[37]\n[31] On ||||||||||||| |||||||||||||, counsel for the Respondent wrote to inform the Court that John Doe was the plaintiff in |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| and had retained and instructed counsel in that matter for nearly two and a half years.[38] Counsel informed the Court that the trial in the |||||||||| |||||||||| was scheduled ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||, that it was expected ||||||||||||| ||||||||||||| in duration, and that John Doe was expected to testify for at least six hours.[39]\n[32] Counsel for the Respondent informed the Court that she had reached out to Dr. Rana to inquire into John Doe\u2019s ability to conduct the ||||||||||| |||||||||||. She provided part of a letter that Dr. Rana sent her, which states the following:\nWe have contacted ||| ||| [John Doe\u2019s lawyer in the || ||], and obtained the update that this matter [the || ||] has been adjourned ||||||| |||||||, which I support as John Doe is not yet ready to proceed with a matter at that level of stress and complexity. \u2026 It is my opinion that at this time, John Doe is not yet functioning at a level to be able to proceed with his matters in Tax Court, and would benefit from a further deferral.[40]\nCounsel took the position that since John Doe could instruct counsel and arrange to testify in the |||||||||| ||||||||||, he could participate in his appeals in the Tax Court.[41]\n2019 [33] On January 8, 2019, the Court proceeded with the status hearing as scheduled. John Doe did not appear. Counsel for the Respondent brought a motion at the hearing to have the 2013 and 2015 appeals dismissed because of John Doe\u2019s failure to appear. The Court granted the motion, having been informed of the existence of the ||||||||||| ||||||||||| and because of the absence of John Doe at the hearing, which was a first, despite his medical condition.\n[34] On February 25, 2019, John Doe filed with the Court a notice of motion to have the judgment dismissing the 2013 and 2015 appeals set aside (the 2013 appeal was for the 2005 and 2006 taxation years, and the 2015 appeal was for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 taxation years). He stated that he was sick, that he had not had the mental capacity to attend that status hearing, and that he was an involuntary patient of the Burnaby mental health facility.[42]\n[35] On May 31, 2019, at the Court\u2019s request, Dr. Rana submitted a letter in order to assist John Doe and the Court in determining whether the judgment should be set aside and whether John Doe had a valid reason for not attending the status hearing of January 8, 2019. The medical report took the form of a letter from Dr. Rana:\nJohn Doe has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. While John Doe\u2019s condition has improved with medication management and case management, he continues to be symptomatic, experiencing difficulty with concentration, disorganized thinking, anxiety, low mood, poor insight, and social isolation. John Doe was last hospitalized in December of 2015, and remains an involuntary patient of the hospital on Extended Leave under the Mental Health Act. John Doe\u2019s certificate under the Mental Health Act was most recently renewed on April 26, 2019. John Doe remains vulnerable to relapse, especially given his multiple psychosocial stressors and his current limited insight into his illness.\nJohn Doe\u2019s diagnosis and current active symptoms are significant contributing factors in his recent failure to appear in Court.[43]\n[36] On June 27, 2019, the Court issued an order setting aside the judgment. The 2013 and 2015 appeals were therefore reinstated.\n[37] On August 30, 2019, John Doe filed an appeal with respect to the 2014 taxation year.\n[38] On November 21, 2019, John Doe filed an appeal with respect to the 2015 and 2016 taxation years. As previously mentioned, neither of the notices of appeal provides details or information regarding the issues on appeal or the facts relied upon by John Doe.\n[39] On November 26, 2019, the Court wrote to the parties to obtain their availability for a status hearing.[44] John Doe replied to the Court on the same day and stated that he needed more time to recover and that he would be out of town for some time attending to a family member who was sick.[45] He requested six months\u2019 time to recover.[46]\n[40] On December 18, 2019, John Doe wrote to the Court and reiterated that he was sick and would be physically unable to attend Court in January and requested a further six\u2011month adjournment.[47]\n2020\u20132021 [41] The Court scheduled a status hearing for January 16, 2020. John Doe did not attend this hearing.\n[42] On January 22, 2020, Marnie Smith, a social worker at the Burnaby Hospital, wrote to the Court regarding John Doe\u2019s absence from the status hearing:\nThe purpose of this letter is to confirm that John Doe \u2026 has been admitted to Burnaby Hospital since January 13, 2020 for treatment of a medical condition.\nI have been informed by [John Doe] that he had a court date scheduled for January 16, 2020 that he unfortunately had to miss due to his admission to hospital. Any assistance you could provide John Doe in rescheduling his court date would be greatly appreciated.[48]\n[43] The Court adjourned the status hearing and directed that another status hearing be held on January 19, 2021.\n[44] In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly curtailed the Court\u2019s operations. Because of the pandemic, the Court had to adjourn the status hearing scheduled for January 19, 2021.\n2022 [45] The Court scheduled a status hearing for May 9, 2022. In preparation for the hearing, counsel for the Respondent had by then issued subpoenas to Dr. Rana and to ||||||||||| ||||||||||| so that both could provide evidence regarding John Doe\u2019s medical condition and his ability to conduct his legal affairs.\n[46] On April 4, 2022, Dr. Rana wrote to the Court regarding the upcoming status hearing:\nThis letter is behalf [sic] of John Doe. He is unable to participate in the upcoming court proceedings on May 9, 2022 due to mental health concerns.[49]\n[47] The Court denied the adjournment request and the hearing proceeded as scheduled.\n[48] John Doe attended the May 9, 2022 status hearing. He appeared generally unable to understand or participate in the Court proceedings. The Court observed that John Doe remained seated in the same position from approximately 9:30 a.m., when the hearing began, until 1:30 p.m., when the hearing concluded. On very few occasions, he gave short answers to the Court\u2019s questions. During the hearing, John Doe told Dr. Rana that he had a headache that day due to stress.[50]\n[49] At the hearing, ||||||||||| ||||||||||| testified to John Doe\u2019s participation in the conduct of the ||||||||||| |||||||||||, including his ability to give him instructions in respect of the court process. ||||||||||| ||||||||||| told the Court that he represented John Doe in the ||||||||||| ||||||||||| which began in ||||||||||| |||||||||||[51] and was resolved out of court by |||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||.[52] He told the Court that John Doe was able to give him instructions at various points during that period.[53] He acknowledged that frequently John Doe had appeared depressed and that they were unable to discuss the case on those occasions.[54] He also stated that he did not constantly seek John Doe\u2019s instructions throughout |||||||||| |||||||||| because many of the steps that he took during the ||||||||||| ||||||||||| did not require John Doe\u2019s guidance.[55] He explained that he mainly sought and received instructions from John Doe one towards ||||||||||||| |||||||||||||, when he was attempting to resolve the case.[56]\n[50] At the hearing, Dr. Rana also testified. Dr. Rana provided the same information that she had previously provided to the Court in her numerous letters. She added that John Doe has been an involuntary patient of the hospital since 2020, but that he lives in the community on extended leave.[57] She explained that he was currently \u201cquite depressed\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t been functioning at all\u201d.[58] She also explained that each time she had submitted a letter to the Court indicating that John Doe was not well enough to attend court, she had previously assessed John Doe and had formed her opinion on his ability to participate.[59] Dr. Rana stated that she did not think that John Doe\u2019s condition would ever change or get better and that, in fact, his condition was getting worse.[60] She explained that John Doe\u2019s condition was cyclical and that his ability to understand or participate in court would depend on his stability on that particular day.[61]\n[51] On June 9, 2022, counsel for the Respondent sent a letter to Dr. Rana. The letter contained a summary of the steps that Dr. Rana had agreed to take at the status hearing of May 9, 2022. The letter stated that Dr. Rana had told the Court that she would do the following:\n-Speak to John Doe\u2019s brother to see if he could assist with hiring a lawyer for John Doe for his appeals and;\n-Have her office look into completing an assessment of whether or not John Doe is incompetent.[62]\n[52] In the letter, counsel for the Respondent asked Dr. Rana if she or her office had made a referral to the PGT in respect of John Doe. If a referral had not been made, counsel asked Dr. Rana whether she or her office intended to make a referral, and if not, the reason why.[63]\n[53] On June 28 or 29, 2022, counsel for the Respondent received a voicemail from Dr. Rana. In the voicemail, Dr. Rana stated that she had tried to have a psychiatrist from her hospital perform a confidential assessment of John Doe, but that nobody had been available. She indicated that the assessment would have to be done privately. She suggested that the Minister hire a private psychiatrist to do the assessment.[64]\n[54] On June 29, 2022, counsel for the Respondent left a voicemail for Dr. Rana in which she stated the following:\n-She explained that she represented the Respondent and not the Appellant;\n-She asked if there was somebody at Burnaby Mental Health who could be made available to do the assessment at some point;\n-She asked whether Dr. Rana could contact someone at another location to do the confidential assessment;\n-She asked whether Dr. Rana had contacted John Doe\u2019s brother; and\n-She asked Dr. Rana to provide the Court with updates on the foregoing.[65]\n[55] On July 13, 2022, counsel for the Respondent sent a letter to Dr. Rana that included a summary of her voicemail of June 29, 2022.[66]\n[56] On July 19, 2022, counsel for the Respondent received a letter. In the letter, Dr. Rana wrote:\nI tried to arrange for psychiatrist [sic] to see him for competency assessment [sic] at Burnaby Psychiatric Services. Unfortunately, we do not provide this service and therefore it will not be available to John Doe. It has been suggested that he can be seen by a private psychiatrist to do the capacity assessment. His family physician can refer him to private psychiatrist [sic] to obtain recommended assessment.\nWe attempted to contact his brother regarding hiring a lawyer for John Doe, and he agreed to the same. The case manager talked to John Doe\u2019s brother and I have advised her to send the information regarding her conversation to [sic] John Doe\u2019s brother to you.[67]\n[57] On July 25, 2022, the legal assistant helping counsel for the Respondent in these appeals (the \u201cLegal Assistant\u201d) contacted Dr. Rana\u2019s office to obtain the telephone number of ||||||| ||||||| (\u201c|||||| ||||||\u201d), John Doe\u2019s brother, and provided the number to counsel for the Respondent.[68]\n[58] On August 3, 2022, counsel for the Respondent, after having obtained ||||||| ||||||| phone number from Dr. Rana\u2019s office, called him numerous times but there was no answer each time.[69] Counsel for the Respondent left a voicemail for |||||| |||||| in which she asked him to attend John Doe\u2019s status hearing on September 13, 2022. Counsel also asked him whether he had retained the services of a lawyer or had a psychiatric consult done by a private psychiatrist for a competency assessment, as Dr. Rana had requested of him. Counsel left follow-up voicemails ||||||||||| ||||||||||| on August 22 and September 2, 2022. She called him again on September 6, 2022, but did not leave a voicemail.[70]\n[59] On August 25, 2022, the Legal Assistant called |||||| |||||| and left a voicemail to follow up on the voicemails left on August 3 and 22, 2022 by counsel for the Respondent.[71]\n[60] On September 6, 2022, the Legal Assistant spoke with Dr. Rana\u2019s assistant about whether Dr. Rana was aware of any actions taken by |||||| ||||||. Dr. Rana\u2019s assistant informed the Legal Assistant that she had just spoken to John Doe\u2019s case manager and that the case manager would call counsel for the Respondent. To the Court\u2019s knowledge, as of the date of this Order, counsel for the Respondent has not received a call back from John Doe\u2019s case manager.[72]\n[61] On September 13, 2022, a status hearing took place. John Doe was present and he was by himself. He told the Court that his brother would not help him and that he wanted to retain counsel but he did not have any money. He also told the Court that he would like to get a psychiatric evaluation but that he did not know how to proceed and questioned whether he would be able to pay for it.[73]\n[62] Unfortunately, the letters from Dr. Rana, John Doe\u2019s doctor, and her testimony at the 2022 status hearing, are not sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that John Doe is under a legal disability.\nIV. THE ISSUE [63] The issue is as follows:\n-Is John Doe under a legal disability pursuant to section 29.1 of the Tax Court Rules?\nV. ANALYSIS A. Rules Applying to an Appeal before the Tax Court of Canada when a Taxpayer is Under a Legal Disability\n[64] Pursuant to section 29.1 of the Tax Court Rules, the representative of a party under a legal disability shall institute or continue a proceeding on behalf of that party. Therefore, a taxpayer under a legal disability must have a representative for any proceeding before this Court. Section 29.1 reads as follows:\n29.1 Unless the Court orders otherwise, the representative of a party under a legal disability shall institute or continue a proceeding on behalf of that party.\n[65] Pursuant to subsections 30(1) and 30(3) of the Tax Court Rules, a party to a proceeding who is an individual may act in person or be represented by counsel. Unless the Court orders otherwise, a person who is the representative of a party under a legal disability in a proceeding shall be represented by counsel, except where that person is also counsel acting in such a capacity.\n[66] Section 30 reads as follows:\n30(1) Subject to subsection (3), a party to a proceeding who is an individual may act in person or be represented by counsel.\n(2) Where a party to a proceeding is not an individual, that party shall be represented by counsel except with leave of the Court and on any conditions that it may determine.\n(3) Unless the Court orders otherwise, a person who is the representative of a party under a legal disability in a proceeding shall be represented by counsel, except where that person is also counsel acting in such a capacity.\n[67] Consequently, pursuant to section 29.1 and subsections 30(1) and 30(3) of the Tax Court Rules, unless this Court decides otherwise, the representative of a taxpayer under a legal disability has to be represented by counsel, unless the representative is acting in such capacity. Therefore, a taxpayer under a legal disability cannot represent herself or himself in any proceeding before this Court.\n[68] In this case, after numerous status hearings where John Doe was not represented, this Court has serious reasons to believe that he might be under a legal disability. Consequently, in order for John Doe\u2019s appeals to proceed, this Court must determine whether John Doe is under a legal disability pursuant to the Tax Court Rules.\n[69] After a review of the jurisprudence under section 29.1 of the Tax Court Rules, it appears that this Court has never been faced with a situation similar to that of John Doe. If it has, no written reasons have been issued to my knowledge.\n[70] In cases where the Tax Court Rules and the case law do not provide the necessary direction, such as in this case, this Court has turned to the local rules of civil procedure for guidance.[74] John Doe resides in the province of British Columbia and his appeals are scheduled to be heard in British Columbia.\n[71] Consequently, in my view, the determination of whether John Doe is under a legal disability under the Tax Court Rules has to be made according to the law of the province of British Columbia.\nB. Rules Applying to Proceedings Before the Supreme Court of British Columbia When a Person is Under a Legal Disability [72] British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court Civil Rules (the \u201cBC Rules\u201d),[75] contain a rule that is very similar to section 29.1 and subsection 30(3) of the Tax Court Rules. Rule 20-2 of the BC Rules governs proceedings instituted or carried on by a person under \u201clegal disability\u201d. Pursuant to rule 20-2(8)(a) of the BC Rules, section 29 of the Interpretation Act[76], and section 1 of the Mental Health Act[77], a person under a \u201clegal disability\u201d is a \u201cperson with a mental disorder\u201d, meaning a person who has a disorder of the mind that requires treatment and seriously impairs the person\u2019s ability to react appropriately to the person\u2019s environment, or to associate with others.\n[73] In Rai v Rai,[78] the Supreme Court of British Columbia stated the following on the subject:\nI note that Rule 20-2(2) of the Supreme Court Civil Rules, B.C. Reg. 168\/2009 restricts the appointment of a litigation guardian to those suffering from a legal disability. The court has inherent jurisdiction to order a medical examination for the purposes of Rule 20-2: Boury v. Iten, 2019 BCCA 81 (B.C. C.A.) at para. 65.\nAccording to Rule 20-2(8)(a), persons under legal disability are infants or \u201cmentally incompetent\u201d persons. The phrase \u201cmentally incompetent person\u201d is defined in the Interpretation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 238, s. 29, to mean \u201ca person with a mental disorder as defined by s. 1 in the Mental Health Act\u201d.\nThe following definition appears in the Mental Health Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 288:\n\u201cperson with a mental disorder\u201d means a person who has a disorder of the mind that requires treatment and seriously impairs the person\u2019s ability to react appropriately to the person\u2019s environment, or to associate with others.[79]\nC. Question to be Answered by the Tax Court of Canada to Determine Whether a Taxpayer is Under a Legal Disability in British Columbia\n[74] In my view, if the appeal is heard in British Columbia, for this Court to conclude that a taxpayer is under a legal disability pursuant to the Tax Court Rules, this Court has to determine whether the person has a mental disorder, whether the disorder requires treatment and if so, whether the disorder seriously impairs the person\u2019s ability to react appropriately to the person\u2019s environment, or to associate with others. If the Court is provided which such evidence, the taxpayer will be legally disabled under the Tax Court Rules and therefore will have to be represented by counsel.\n[75] Therefore, it is this Court\u2019s view that in order for John Doe\u2019s appeals to proceed further, this Court must first determine whether he is a person who has a disorder of the mind that requires treatment and seriously impairs his ability to react appropriately to his environment, or to associate with others.\nD. Options Available to the Tax Court of Canada to have a Taxpayer\u2019s Medical Condition Assessed\n[76] In my view, when a taxpayer is not represented and the appeal is heard in British Columbia, in order to determine whether the taxpayer is under a legal disability under the Tax Court Rules, this Court has an implied jurisdiction and therefore the power to do the following:\n-Issue an order in which the taxpayer must provide a medical report advising whether the taxpayer is under a legal disability;\n-Issue an order to appoint a lawyer as an amicus curiae to represent the taxpayer, and then request that the amicus curiae obtain a medical report advising whether the taxpayer is under a legal disability; or\n-Issue an order that counsel for the Respondent notify the PGT. The PGTcan determine whether it should represent the taxpayer. If the PGTdetermines that it should represent the taxpayer, order the PGTto obtain a medical report advising whether the taxpayer is under a legal disability.\n[77] This Court is of the opinion that it has the implied jurisdiction to issue these orders based on the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada decision in Canada v Dow Chemical Canada ULC.[80] In that decision, the Federal Court of Appeal described the Tax Court of Canada\u2019s jurisdiction by necessary implication as follows:\nIn Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, at paragraph 33, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Federal Court does not have any inherent jurisdiction, but rather only the jurisdiction conferred on it by statute. Since the Tax Court is also a statutory court, this finding applies equally to the Tax Court. \u2026\nAlthough the Tax Court does not have any inherent jurisdiction, it does have an implied jurisdiction by necessary implication. In R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10, at paragraph 19, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that statutory courts have an implied jurisdiction by necessary implication to carry out the functions of a court. Since the Tax Court is a statutory court, it also has this implied jurisdiction. Therefore, \u201c\u2026 the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime \u2026\u201d (ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, at paragraph 51).[81]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[78] Consequently, even if this Court does not have the inherent jurisdiction of superior courts, that is, the authority to control its process, prevent abuses of process, and ensure that the machinery of the court functions in an orderly and effective manner,[82] it has the implied jurisdiction by necessary implication to carry out the function of a court. For that reason, in my view, this Court has the power to issue an order to obtain a medical report from a taxpayer, to appoint an amicus curiae to assist the Court or to direct counsel for the Respondent to notify the PGT if the Court believes that the taxpayer might be under a legal disability.\n(1) Issue an Order in Which the Taxpayer Must Provide a Medical Report Advising Whether He or She is Under a Legal Disability [79] The first option available to the Court is to order a taxpayer to provide a medical report advising whether he or she is under a legal disability. This option is not appropriate in the circumstances simply because it would not be fair to John Doe.\n[80] In the circumstances, more specifically because of John Doe\u2019s medical condition, the information provided by Dr. Rana with respect to the medical system, and the Court\u2019s interactions with John Doe during the course of the proceedings, the Court is of the view that it cannot ask John Doe to provide evidence that he is under a legal disability for the following reasons:\n-John Doe told the Court that he wants to get an assessment from a qualified health care provider to determine whether he is under a legal disability. He also told the Court that he does not know how to do it or who to ask for it;\n-John Doe told the Court that even if he was able to find a qualified health care provider who could do the assessment, he does not have the financial capacity to pay for the service;\n-John Doe\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Rana, has not been able to have John Doe assessed by a qualified health care professional. I have serious doubts that John Doe, on his own, would be able to find a qualified health care professional who could do an assessment in the circumstances; and\n-If John Doe was able to find a health care professional to do the assessment, the Court is of the view that he would not be able to give the necessary instructions to the professional for the assessment to be useful to this Court.\n[81] For all these reasons, this Court has concluded that the first option is not appropriate in the circumstances.\n(2) Issue an Order to Appoint a Lawyer as an Amicus Curiae [82] The second option is for the Court to appoint a lawyer as an amicus curiae, that is, a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d, to assist the Court. This can be done only in exceptional circumstances after certain conditions are met.[83] In Imona-Russell, the Supreme Court of Canada explained the source of a court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to appoint an amicus curiae as follows:\nA court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to appoint amicus in criminal trials is grounded in its authority to control its own process and function as a court of law. Much like the jurisdiction to exercise control over counsel when necessary to protect the court\u2019s process that was recognized in Cunningham v. Lilles, 2010 SCC 10, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 331 (S.C.C.), at para. 18, the ability to appoint amici is linked to the court\u2019s authority to \u201crequest its officers, particularly the lawyers to whom the court afforded exclusive rights of audience, to assist its deliberations\u201d (B. M. Dickens, \u201cA Canadian Development: Non-Party Intervention\u201d (1977), 40 Mod. L. Rev. 666, at p. 671).[84]\n[83] Although the above quotation refers to a court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction, which, as previously stated, the Tax Court lacks as a statutory court,[85] it is clear from the decision that statutory courts also have the power to appoint an amicus curiae through the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication.[86] Furthermore, on this issue, in Imona-Russell, the minority of the Supreme Court stated the following:\nIn the case of statutory courts, the power to appoint an amicus derives from the court\u2019s authority to control its own process in order to administer justice fully and effectively. Their authority to appoint amici is necessarily implied in the power to function as a court of law: Ontario v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 (S.C.C.), at paras. 70-71; Cunningham, at para. 19.[87]\n[84] In the Morwald-Benevides decision,[88] the Ontario Court of Appeal applied the principles enunciated in Imona-Russell in the context of a private family law case. The Court took the principles found in Imona-Russell and applied them with the necessary modifications.[89] These principles, as summarized in WAC v CAF, 2021 ONSC 5140, are the following:\n(a) The appointment of amicus is \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201crare\u201d. Trial judges routinely resolve family law disputes without counsel on one or even both sides. Self-representation, on its own, is an insufficient reason to appoint amicus;\n(b) Trial judges must consider whether they can personally provide sufficient guidance to an unrepresented party, in the circumstances of the case, to permit a fair and orderly trial;\n(c) The Court should also consider the availability of alternatives to appointing amicus. These might include the availability of legal aid or appointing the Children\u2019s Lawyer in a case involving a child. But the Court may also balance against these potential alternatives, how invoking them might create more delay;\n(d) Amicus may be appointed in rare or exceptional circumstances, when a judge requires assistance to ensure \u201cthe orderly conduct of proceedings\u201d, and \u201cthe availability of relevant submissions\u201d;\n(e) A party has a right to self-represent. Nevertheless, amicus might be warranted where the self-represented party is \u201cungovernable or contumelious\u201d, where the party refuses to participate or disrupts trial proceedings, or where the party is adamant about conducting the case personally but is \u201chopelessly incompetent to do so, risking real injustice\u201d;\n(f) The assistance of amicus must be essential to the adequate discharge of the judicial functions in the case. The stakes must be high enough to warrant amicus;\n(g) Amicus may assist in the presentation of evidence, but cannot control a party\u2019s litigation strategy;\n(h) \u201cVery rarely\u201d, amicus may mirror the duties of traditional counsel;\n(i) However it is defined, the role of amicus must be clear, detailed and precise. During the trial, the Court must monitor the amicus, to ensure that he or she stays on course and remains within the limits of the role;\n(j) The role may change or be refined as circumstances change during trial;\n(k) Once appointed, the amicus is bound by a duty of loyalty and integrity to the Court, not to any of the parties to the proceedings; and\n(l) A party may not discharge amicus; only the Court may do so.[90]\n[85] On the basis of these principles, the Court has concluded that it is too early to proceed with this option because there is an alternative option. The alternative option available to the Court in the circumstances is to report the situation to the PGT and if necessary, make a referral. While pursuing the alternative option might create more delay, given the information available to the Court, it is the appropriate option to pursue at this stage.\n(3) Order Counsel for the Respondent to Notify the PGT [86] In British Columbia, the PGT is the default statutory representative of a person declared to be under a legal disability.[91] The PGT can act as an adult\u2019s statutory property guardian under the Adult Guardianship Act. As statutory property guardian, the PGT may make decisions regarding an adult\u2019s financial affairs.[92] The expression \u201cfinancial affairs\u201d is defined in section 1 of the Adult Guardianship Act and pursuant to that definition, an adult\u2019s financial affairs includes the adult\u2019s legal affairs.[93]\n[87] Pursuant to paragraph 32(1)(a) of the Adult Guardianship Act, a health care provider who believes that an adult is incapable of managing his or her financial affairs can request that a qualified health care provider assess the adult\u2019s incapability. In this case, Dr. Rana told counsel for the Respondent that she could not have John Doe\u2019s medical condition assessed.[94] Consequently, and in any event, paragraph 32(1)(b) of the Adult Guardianship Act finds application in the circumstances.\n[88] Pursuant to paragraph 32(1)(b) of the Adult Guardianship Act, in any case, a person who believes that John Doe is incapable of managing his legal affairs can notify the PGT of their belief, and the PGT may then request a qualified health care provider to assess the adult\u2019s incapability.\n[89] Subsection 32(1) reads as follows:\nObtaining a statutory property guardian\n32 (1) If a person has reason to believe that an adult may be incapable of managing the adult\u2019s financial affairs, the person may\n(a) if the person is a health care provider, request a qualified health care provider to assess the adult\u2019s incapability, or\n(b) in any case, notify the Public Guardian and Trustee of the person\u2019s belief, and the Public Guardian and Trustee may request a qualified health care provider to assess the adult\u2019s incapability.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[90] Given the circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that the only person who can notify the PGT of the Court\u2019s belief that John Doe is incapable of managing his legal affairs is counsel for the Respondent. To the Court\u2019s knowledge, John Doe does not have any family member or any other person, including his psychiatrist it seems, who can or is willing to notify the PGT of this Court\u2019s belief that he might be incapable of managing his legal affairs.\n[91] Pursuant to section 32 of the Adult Guardianship Act, an adult assessment is a four-step process.\n[92] In step one, after being notified, the PGT may request that a qualified health care provider assess the adult\u2019s incapability.[95]\n[93] In step two, the qualified health care provider assesses the adult to determine whether he or she is incapable of managing his or her legal affairs. If this is the case, the qualified health care provider may report the adult\u2019s incapability to a health authority designate.[96]\n[94] In step three, if the health authority designate issues a certificate of incapability, the health authority designate will forward the certificate to the PGT.[97]\n[95] In step four, if the PGT is forwarded a certificate, it becomes the adult\u2019s statutory property guardian as of the date on which the certificate of incapability was signed by the health authority designate. Afterwards, the PGT will be able to make decisions regarding the adult\u2019s legal affairs.[98]\n[96] Consequently, after the PGT is notified by counsel for the Respondent, the PGT will become the representative of John Doe and in such case, represent John Doe in his Tax Court proceedings.\nVI.

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] The appellant purchased a new townhouse at 49 Dryden Way in Etobicoke, Ontario, and applied for the Ontario portion of the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate with respect to the property.\nII. Legislative framework\n[2] Subsection 254(2) of the Excise Tax Act provides for the partial rebate of the tax paid by an individual when buying a new home from a builder and sets out a list of prerequisite requirements. For the purposes of this appeal, I would paraphrase them as follows:\nthe builder makes a taxable supply by selling a single unit residential complex or a residential condominium unit to the individual;\nat the time the parties enter into the purchase\/sale agreement, the individual is acquiring the complex\/unit for use as the primary residence of the individual or their relation;\nthe total consideration is less than $450,000;\nthe individual has paid the GST\/HST on the purchase;\nownership of the complex\/unit is transferred to the individual after construction is substantially completed;\nduring the period between substantial completion of construction and possession under the purchase\/sale agreement,\ni. with respect to a single unit residential complex \u2013 no one occupied it; and\nwith respect to a residential condominium unit \u2013 only a purchaser under the purchase\/sale agreement occupied it;\nafter substantial completion of construction, the first person to occupy the complex\/unit is the individual or their relation.\n[3] In Ontario, there is still a new housing rebate available where the total consideration exceeds $450,000, due to the combined effect of subsection 256.21(1) of the Act and subsection 41(2) of the New Harmonized Value-Added Tax System Regulations, No. 2.[1] The rebate is limited to a maximum of $24,000 and the individual must still meet the remaining prerequisites in subsection 254(2).[2]\n[4] For the purposes of the rebate, a \u201crelation\u201d means an individual who is related to the particular individual, or the former spouse\/common-law partner of the particular individual.[3] Related persons by reason of subsections 251(2) to (6) of the Income Tax Act are also related for the purposes of the Excise Tax Act. The relevant portions of subsections 251(2) to (6) say that:\nrelated persons are individuals connected by blood relationship, marriage or common-law partnership or adoption;[4] and\npersons are connected by blood relationship if one is the child or other descendant of the other or one is the brother or sister of the other.[5]\nIII. Issue\n[5] The question in this appeal is whether the appellant met the residence requirements under subsection 254(2), to qualify for the Ontario portion of the new housing rebate under subsection 41(2) of the Regulations.\n[6] Specifically, the Minister of National Revenue denied the rebate on the basis that neither the appellant nor a qualified relation intended to or actually occupied the townhouse as a primary place of residence, pursuant to paragraph 254(2)(b).[6]\nIV. Factual background\n[7] The appellant purchased the three-bedroom townhouse at 49 Dryden Way in Etobicoke as a pre-build and signed the purchase\/sale agreement on July 7, 2014.[7] Before taxes, the purchase price was $574,327.43 and she took possession on May 8, 2017.[8]\n[8] The appellant is a yoga instructor and university-educated, with a Masters degree in Business. She testified that when she signed the purchase\/sale agreement in 2014, she had just discovered that her husband was cheating on her. She stated that including about five attempts to reconcile over a five-year period, they were married for a total of 22 years and by the time of this hearing, they were close to finalizing their divorce.\n[9] She testified that upon learning of her husband\u2019s infidelity, she moved into her parents\u2019 Caledon, Ontario home and thought about her next steps. She stated that at the time she purchased the townhouse, she did not own any other properties. The builder required an initial deposit of $15,000 in July 2014, followed by three additional consecutive monthly $15,000 deposits from August to September 2014.[9] The appellant\u2019s parents paid the four deposits by initial cheque and three post-dated cheques.[10]\n[10] The appellant stated that the mortgage loan for the townhouse was amortized over a 25- or 30-year period, resulting in monthly payments of about $800. She was not working between 2014 and 2017, and used her bank account from her marriage to guarantee the loan. She explained that the bank account held funds which came from her then-husband during their marriage, but that the money was hers.\n[11] The appellant testified that after taking possession of the townhouse, she lived there with her twin sister Jennifer. She stated that Jennifer was divorced and shared equal custody of her children, so Jennifer\u2019s children resided in the townhouse at times as well. The appellant explained that Jennifer lived there because she was renovating her own house and needed a place to stay during that period. The appellant acknowledged that her whole family works in the real estate field. She stated that her older sister works in real estate while Jennifer stages homes.\n[12] She stated that she did her undergraduate studies in Ohio and that she has owned a house at 624 Athens in Cincinnati since 2008. She testified that she goes there often and that her telephone number has always been an Ohio number. Her then-husband worked for Procter & Gamble and his job required him to work outside of Canada, including Panama in 2017 and 2018. In cross-examination, she acknowledged that she was in Panama often during 2017 and 2018 because they were undergoing marriage counselling and attempting to reconcile.\n[13] In 2019, the appellant purchased a house in Etobicoke and the sale closed in June 2020. She stated that she rented out the 49 Dryden Way townhouse at that point because her plan\/hope at the time was that she and her then-husband would live together in the Etobicoke house. She stated that when the global pandemic arose in 2020, he did not want to live in the recently purchased Etobicoke house because his job required him to work all over the world.\n[14] She stated that the Etobicoke house was too large to live in alone and that after the pandemic subsided, her then-husband was relocated to the U.S. by Procter & Gamble. She testified that since they were attempting to reconcile at the time, she went to the Cincinnati house in order to be together. However, their reconciliation efforts were ultimately unsuccessful and their marriage ended. She testified that since their divorce, she has returned to live with her parents in Caledon and decide her next steps, while her ex-husband resides in the 624 Athens house in Cincinnati. She also stated that she recently rented out the Etobicoke house.\n[15] The appellant tendered copies of receipts, invoices, and statements showing the following:\npurchase of a home alarm system in May 2017, billed to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way;[11]\npurchase of dwelling insurance on May 5, 2017, for the period from May 8, 2017 to May 8, 2018, for 49 Dryden Way and showing the appellant as purchaser;[12]\nopening of an Enbridge account (for natural gas) on May 9, 2017, with no name or address on the excerpt provided;[13]\nfirst-time TV, internet, and home phone charges from Bell billed on June 26, 2017, to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way;[14]\npurchase of a queen size bed and a double bed from Structube on June 28, 2017, billed to the appellant at 48 Dryden Way. Based on the receipt, \u201cbed\u201d means bed frame and not the mattresses. The appellant also explained that the townhouse is on Lot 48;[15]\nexchange of the queen size bed from charcoal color to linen color on July 6, 2017, billed to the appellant at Lot 48 \u2013 49 Dryden Way;[16]\n2017 Toronto property taxes for 49 Dryden Way assessed to the appellant as owner on December 20, 2017;[17]\ntwo dining chairs sold to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way on January 12, 2018;[18]\na 7-light brass ceiling light sold to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way on January 8, 2018, with an estimated ready date of March 31, 2018.[19] The appellant stated that this light fixture was for the foyer;\nan 8-light brass chandelier sold on April 10, 2018 to \u201cDesigner Studio\u201d at 49 Dryden Way.[20] The appellant stated that this light fixture was for the kitchen and recalled that she likely used her sister\u2019s staging business in order to receive a designer discount. Although the appellant\u2019s name does not appear on the invoice, I note that the purchaser\u2019s contact number is a Cincinnati area code;\na 13-piece knife block set and a pair of Waterford crystal glasses sold to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way on June 6, 2018;[21]\nutilities billed by Toronto to the appellant at 49 Dryden Way for water consumption and sewer services for the period from June 18 to October 15, 2018;[22]\nVisa credit card purchases made from December 19 to 24, 2018, at various establishments near 49 Dryden Way, including Sherway Gardens shopping centre, Pet Valu, Metro grocery store, Richview animal hospital, and Shoppers Drug Mart, among others. The statement shows the appellant as account holder at 49 Dryden Way;[23]\ninstallation of a central vacuum system billed to \u201cJanis\u201d at 49 Dryden Way on June 1, 2017.[24] The appellant testified that she has a Schnauzer breed of dog[25] and was accustomed to having central vacuum; and\nan Amazon order confirmation dated April 9, 2018 showing the purchase of resum\u00e9 paper by the appellant and 49 Dryden Way as the delivery address.[26] The appellant testified that she purchased the paper because she was looking for a job at the time.\n[16] The appellant tendered copies of smartphone photos showing various events that took place in the townhouse, including her niece\u2019s birthday celebration (date-stamped November 2017),[27] a New Year\u2019s eve gathering with her then-husband and in-laws (date-stamped December 31, 2017),[28] and a photo of her with her parents, sisters, and niece toasting the closing of her purchase of the townhouse.[29] She also tendered photos showing her dog at the living room window (date-stamped December 2017),[30] her nieces and nephew on the staircase, her garden that she planted in front of the townhouse;[31] and herself doing yoga poses in the lower-level rec room of the townhouse.[32] Some photos also showed in the background a large marble coffee table which the appellant said was purchased from Restoration Hardware and required four men to deliver.[33]\n[17] She also tendered photos of a drainage problem involving an external pipe (date-stamped December 2017),[34] an incorrectly installed closet door,[35] an improperly sanded\/painted wall,[36] and a misaligned external door frame.[37] She testified that these photos were taken in 2017 for the purpose of communicating deficiencies to the builder.\nV. Discussion and analysis\n[18] The respondent says that in order to qualify for the rebate, subsection 254(2) requires that: (i) the particular individual intend to use the property as their (or their relation\u2019s) primary residence, and (ii) proof of this intention in turn requires that the particular individual (or their relation) occupy the property as their primary residence. With respect to the latter aspect regarding proof, the respondent relies on the proposition that a person\u2019s statement of their subjective purpose or intent is not necessarily or always the most reliable basis on which to resolve the question of intent and that actual use is often the best evidence.[38]\n[19] The wording of subsection 254(2) does not support the respondent\u2019s latter contention that proof of intent requires the appellant (or her relation) to actually occupy the townhouse as their primary residence. Paragraph 254(2)(b) says that at the time of purchase, the purchaser must have intended to use the property as either their (or their relation\u2019s) primary residence. Paragraph 254(2)(g) then provides that after substantial completion of construction of a residential condominium unit, the first person to occupy it must be the purchaser or their relation, i.e. there is no requirement that it be used as their primary place of residence.\n[20] The proposition put forth in the case law says that a party\u2019s actions are often the best objective evidence of their stated subjective intent and I agree.\n[21] The appellant\u2019s testimony and timeline of events have the messy authenticity of a marital breakdown in which the couple has been together for a significant period of time and has the means in terms of resources, time, motivation, and support to attempt reconciliation in multiple cities. She acknowledged that her family works in the real estate field which likely contributed to her comfort level with buying the townhouse followed by the Etobicoke house in relatively short order; the balance of the explanation is likely attributable to emotional choices.\n[22] There was no evidence of a history of flipping properties or any profit-related motive on her part. On a balance, her actions were more consistent with an individual making personal choices rather than business decisions. For example, she had owned a house in Cincinnati since 2008 and it appears that during her marriage, she spent time in both Canada and the U.S. although the proportions were unclear. On learning of her husband\u2019s infidelity, she returned to Ontario and purchased the townhouse with the financial help of her parents; the choice to live closer to one\u2019s family in these circumstances does not seem unusual.\n[23] Reconciliation attempts are also not unusual during a marital breakdown. Given that her then-husband worked for a multi-national U.S. corporation, it is reasonable that the appellant lived in Panama with him for a period while still owning the townhouse and furnishing it to be her home. The subsequent purchase of the Etobicoke house appears to have been a hopeful and perhaps impulsive choice on her part but again, in the circumstances, it does not appear to be profit-motivated either.\n[24] The appellant\u2019s various purchases and their sequencing after taking possession of the townhouse also suggest that she intended to live there as her primary residence. Some examples are as follows:\nshe took possession of the townhouse on May 8, 2017, following which she had a home alarm system installed and set up the various utilities;\nshe purchased a bed (i.e. a bed frame) in charcoal color and then took the trouble to exchange it for another color, while sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the meantime;\nshe owns a dog and upon taking possession of the townhouse on May 8, 2017, she had a central vacuum system installed by June 1st.\n[25] When the more essential aspects of home ownership were set up, she then took longer to do non-essential tasks, examples of which are as follows:\nthe ceiling light for the foyer was purchased on January 8, 2018, with an estimated ready date of March 31, 2018, i.e. almost three months later;\nthe ceiling light for the kitchen was then purchased on April 10, 2018, from a different store;\nshe ordered resum\u00e9 paper on April 9, 2018, to be delivered to the townhouse address;\nshe purchased a solid marble coffee table; and\nshe planted a garden.\n[26] The fact that the appellant took smartphone photos of construction deficiencies for the builder is also reminiscent of the behavior of a purchaser who plans to live in the home in question. She habitually documented various events by taking smartphone photos and the magnitude of the events ranged from small (e.g. her dog at the living room window) to significant (e.g. taking possession of the townhouse). In cross-examination, the respondent suggested that the photos could have been taken in locations other than at the townhouse. I do not believe that to be the case here.\n[27] As a blood relative, the appellant\u2019s sister is a \u201crelation\u201d under the Act.[39] However, the evidence does not suggest that the appellant purchased the townhouse for her sister to use as a primary residence, nor that her sister was the first to occupy it after substantial completion of construction. Therefore, the fact that she may have resided in the townhouse is not relevant for the purposes of the rebate.\nVI. Conclusion\n[28] Based on the above findings, I am of the view that: (a) when the appellant purchased the townhouse, she intended to use it as her primary residence, and (b) after substantial completion of construction, she was the first person to occupy it. Therefore, she qualified for the Ontario portion of the new housing rebate with respect to her purchase of 49 Dryden Way.\n[29] The appeal is allowed, without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 2nd day of June 2023.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 81\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-1326(GST)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJANIS ROBB AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nToronto, Ontario\nDATE OF HEARING:\nJune 30, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nJune 2, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nCharles Haworth\nThomas Ritthaler (summer student)\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nAmin Nur\nSharon Lee\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nCharles Haworth\nFirm:\nRadnoff Law Offices\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] SOR\/2010-151\n[2] New Harmonized Value-Added Tax System Regulations, No. 2, SOR\/2010-151, subsection 41(2)\n[3] Subsection 254(1), Excise Tax Act\n[4] Paragraph 251(2)(a), Income Tax Act\n[5] Paragraph 251(6)(a), Income Tax Act\n[6] Exhibit R-1, Tab 17\n[7] Exhibit A-1, Tab 2\n[8] Exhibit A-1, Tab 7\n[9] Exhibit A-1, Tab 2\n[10] Exhibit A-1, Tab 1\n[11] Exhibit A-1, Tab 5\n[12] Exhibit A-1, Tab 6\n[13] Exhibit A-1, Tab 8\n[14] Exhibit A-1, Tab 9\n[15] Exhibit A-1, Tab 10\n[16] Exhibit A-1, Tab 11\n[17] Exhibit A-1, Tab 12\n[18] Exhibit A-1, Tab 14\n[19] Exhibit A-1, Tab 13\n[20] Exhibit A-2, Tab 28\n[21] Exhibit A-1, Tab 16\n[22] Exhibit A-1, Tab 21\n[23] Exhibit A-1, Tab 24\n[24] Exhibit A-1, Tab 3\n[25] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27 (page 8)\n[26] Exhibit A-1, Tab 28\n[27] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27\n[28] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27\n[29] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[30] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27\n[31] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[32] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[33] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27 (pages 7 and 11), Tab 29 (page 26)\n[34] Exhibit A-2, Tab 27\n[35] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[36] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[37] Exhibit A-2, Tab 29\n[38] Kandiah v.

Introduction\n[1] Citizens receive Notices of Assessment and Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency that are often four or five pages long. Not surprisingly, they often assume that all the different $ amounts that may be shown on the Notice have been \u201cassessed\u201d or \u201cdetermined\u201d by the Agency pursuant to the Income tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] This appeal turns on what exactly, as a mater of law, is \u201cassessed\u201d or \u201creassessed\u201d by a Notice of Assessment or Reassessment made pursuant to the Act.\nII. Background\n[3] There were no issues as to the documents or as to the facts.[1]\n[4] The Appellant appeals from an assessment of his 2020 taxation year that assessed more tax than he expected.\n[5] The increase resulted from the minister having concluded that the amount of net capital losses available to the Appellant was lower than the amount claimed by the Appellant, resulting in a higher taxable income and higher tax.\n[6] The respondent reduced the net capital loss balance because part of what was included in the balance was an amount of net capital loss incurred prior to the Appellant\u2019s discharge from bankruptcy in 1994. Pursuant to subparagraph 128(2)(g)(i) of the Income Tax Act losses incurred prior to the discharge from bankruptcy may not be deducted in taxation years after the discharge from bankruptcy.\n[7] The Appellant does not dispute the application of subparagraph 128(2)(g)(i).\n[8] The Appellant does not claim that the Notice of Assessment dated 6 May 2021 with respect to the 2020 taxation year is out of time.\n[9] What the Appellant does dispute is the Respondent adjusting the amount of capital loss carry forward so many years after his discharge.\n[10] Over the years, the Appellant has received Notices of Assessment that show a balance of his net capital loss that includes the amount of his net capital loss balance prior to his discharge from bankruptcy.\n[11] For example, this is the case 1) in the Notice of Assessment dated 23 August 2018 with respect to the 2017 taxation year[2] and 2) in the Notice of 13 May 2019 with respect to the 2018 taxation year[3].\n[12] In the Notice of Assessment of July 30, 2020 with respect to the 2019 taxation year, this changes. There is a statement that \u201cWe have reduced your net capital loss for other years to.... You cannot claim losses from before the year of your absolute discharge from bankruptcy on your return for that year or any later year.\u201d[4]\n[13] The Appellant never sought or received a Notice of Determination of a loss.\nIII. Analysis\n[14] The Appellant\u2019s position amounts to this: the net capital loss balances shown in the various Notices of Assessment prior to July 30, 2020 reflect a determination made in an assessment many years ago that the net capital loss balance included the losses that he had prior to his discharge from bankruptcy.\n[15] Further, he submits that, some 25 years after the fact, it was far too late on July 30, 2020 for the Minister to modify that determination and make an adjustment to his loss balance due to a discharge from bankruptcy in 1994. In effect, the Appellant is arguing that such an adjustment is statute barred by reason of the earlier determination contained in an earlier assessment.\n[16] The Appellant relies on the time limitations in subsection 152(4) of the Income tax Act and on the provisions of subsection 152(1.3) of the Income Tax Act. [5]\n[17] The key words of subsection 152(1.3)[6] are :\n(1.3) \u2026 where the Minister makes a determination of the amount of a taxpayer's \u2026, net capital loss\u2026 the determination is \u2026 binding on both the Minister and the taxpayer \u2026[7]\n[18] I do not agree.\n[19] The Income Tax Act is very specific in terms of what is assessed or determined. The key provision with respect to assessments and reassessments is in the opening words of subsection 152(1) of the Income Tax Act:\nThe Minister shall \u2026 examine a taxpayer's return of income for a taxation year, assess the tax for the year, the interest and penalties, if any, payable \u2026[8]\n(Emphasis added)\n[20] With respect to the determination of net capital losses the key provision is in subsection 152(1.1) of the Income Tax Act:\nWhere the Minister ascertains the amount of a taxpayer's \u2026, net capital loss, \u2026 and the taxpayer has not reported that amount as such a loss in the taxpayer's return of income for that year, the Minister shall, at the request of the taxpayer, determine \u2026, the amount of the loss and shall send a notice of determination...[9]\n(Emphasis added)\n[21] There are a number of other provisions of the Income Tax Act that provide for very specific determinations but none of them are relevant here.\n[22] In assessing a taxation year, the Minister proceeds on the basis of certain facts and a particular analytical framework. Those facts and that analysis are not \u201cassessed\u201d or \u201cdetermined\u201d in the sense referred to in sections 152(1) or 152(1.1) above. Some of the facts involve prior years. For example, if an asset is disposed of, it is necessary to consider its cost when acquired; similarly, in determining capital cost allowance for an asset, the amount of capital cost allowance claimed in prior years may be relevant.\n[23] The time limitations contained in subsection 152(4) of the Income tax Act only prevent reassessments of the tax, interest and penalties assessed for a particular year. They do not make all the other amounts shown in a Notice of Assessment binding.\n[24] Similarly, the effect of subsection 152(1.1) of the Income Tax Act is to render binding a specific loss determination requested by the taxpayer and conveyed to the taxpayer by a Notice of Determination. Subsection 152(1.1) does not go further than that.\n[25] As a result, it is well established that the Minister may consider the actual facts in the prior years even if in assessing a prior year the Minister had proceeded on a different factual basis.[10] Similarly, if in a prior year, the Minister makes an error in applying the law in a prior year, the Minister may correct the error when assessing a later year.\n[26] For example, in Coastal Construction & Excavating Ltd. v. R.[11], Justice Bowman, as he then was, says:\n24 Finally, the appellant contends that because the Minister, in prior years, had treated the operation as a \u201cfacility\u201d as defined in the RDIA he was not entitled to change the investment tax credit carry-forward from those admittedly statute-barred years to affect the taxable income of a year that was not statute-barred to conform to his view that the property was qualified and not certified. This interpretation would involve a conclusion that a determination of the balance of a carry-forward of investment tax credits for a statute-barred year was tantamount to an assessment. I do not read section 152 of the Income Tax Act as supporting such a conclusion. The Minister is obliged to assess in accordance with the law. If he assesses a prior year incorrectly and that year becomes statute-barred this will prevent his reassessing tax for that year, but it does not prevent his correcting the error in a year that is not statute-barred, even though it involves adjusting carry-forward balances from previous years, whether they be loss carry-forwards or balances of investment tax credits. New St. James Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue\u2026 (Citations omitted)\n(Emphasis added)\n[27] More recently, in Peach v. The Queen [12] Justice Monaghan, as she then was, stated:\n[66] The law is clear that:\n\u201cif an error is made in the assessment of a statute-barred year, which affects another year, the Minister, in assessing the other year, must follow the Act and if there was an error in law in a previous year, including a statute-barred year, that error ought to be corrected so that the assessment for the current year is correct\u201d.\n(Citations omitted)\n[28] This is a general principle that is limited only in certain very specific situations pursuant to specific provisions of the Income Tax Act.\n[29] It is quite clear from the legislation that, in the absence of a Notice of Determination, a statement contained within a Notice of Assessment that a certain amount is the available balance of net capital losses does not constitute a determination to which subsection 152(1.3) applies. Further, such a statement does not constitute an assessment of that amount subject to the time limitations set out in subsection 152(4).\nIV. Conclusion\n[30] As a result, given that, there was never a Notice of Determination, the Minister was not barred from taking account of the consequences of the bankruptcy in assessing the Appellant\u2019s 2020 taxation year.\n[31] The appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 8th day of June 2023.\n\u201cG.

Canada (No. 1) 1991 CanLII 14095 (FC). In Placer Dome, the reassessment in issue was statute barred by an earlier assessment. That is a quite different issue from the one here.\n[6] Although it is not relevant here, I would note that by reason of the provisions of subsection 152(1.2), as with assessments, there is a period during which redeterminations may be made as well as certain circumstances where the Minister can make redeterminations beyond the normal redetermination period.\n[7] I have removed the portions of the subsection that are not relevant to this appeal. The full text of the subsection is:\n(1.3) For greater certainty, where the Minister makes a determination of the amount of a taxpayer's non-capital loss, net capital loss, restricted farm loss, farm loss or limited partnership loss for a taxation year or makes a determination under subsection (1.11) with respect to a taxpayer, the determination is (subject to the taxpayer's rights of objection and appeal in respect of the determination and to any redetermination by the Minister) binding on both the Minister and the taxpayer for the purpose of calculating the income, taxable income or taxable income earned in Canada of, tax or other amount payable by, or amount refundable to, the taxpayer, as the case may be, for any taxation year.\n[8] I am just reproducing the key words.\n[9] The full text of the subsection is:\nWhere the Minister ascertains the amount of a taxpayer's non-capital loss, net capital loss, restricted farm loss, farm loss or limited partnership loss for a taxation year and the taxpayer has not reported that amount as such a loss in the taxpayer's return of income for that year, the Minister shall, at the request of the taxpayer, determine, with all due dispatch, the amount of the loss and shall send a notice of determination to the person by whom the return was filed.\n[10] In this regard, it is useful to bear in mind that many returns are simply assessed as filed while other assessments or reassessments may only involve limited examination of some but not all aspects of the return.\n[11] [1996] 3 C.T.C. 2845 at 2856, 1996 CanLII 21537 at the last page (TCC), 97 D.T.C. 26.\n[12] 2020 TCC 12\n[13] The hearing was to be by videoconference.

BACKGROUND\n[1] Roderic Parker (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals the reassessment for his 2006 taxation year. The Appellant was a participant in the Canadian Humanitarian Trust Tax Shelter (\u201cCHT Arrangement\u201d). The Appellant claimed a charitable tax credit on the basis that he had made a cash donation of $14,612 and a donation of pharmaceuticals with a purported value of $44,129 to registered charities, for a total donation of $58,741. The Minister of National Revenue (\u201cMinister\u201d) initially disallowed the entire claim, but subsequently allowed the cash portion. Only the claim relating to the purported in-kind donation of pharmaceuticals remains in issue.\n[2] The CHT Arrangement was previously reviewed by this Court in Morrison v. R[1] where Justice Owen allowed Mr. Morrison\u2019s claim for the cash contribution and dismissed the appeal in respect of the purported donation of pharmaceuticals. Justice Owen found that Mr. Morrison had not established that he had acquired the pharmaceuticals and therefore did not make a gift in-kind to a charity.[2] That decision was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner v. Canada[3] and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied. While Morrison was the lead case in a group of appeals, the Appellant did not agree to be bound by the decision and pursued his appeal in this Court.\nII. FACTS\n[3] The Respondent called one witness - Mr. Ronald Monahan. Mr. Monahan is a senior auditor with the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) who acted as a lead auditor for the CHT Arrangement[4] and also testified in Morrison. The Appellant represented himself at the hearing and testified. I found both witnesses to be credible.While the Respondent sought to introduce an affidavit of Mr. Monahan as evidence, in light of Mr. Monahan\u2019s appearance as a witness, I have relied on his oral testimony and not the contents of the affidavit. Certain documents which are tabs to the affidavit were referred to by Mr. Monahan in his testimony and were introduced as evidence.[5]\n[4] The evidence regarding how the CHT Arrangement worked was introduced through Mr. Monahan\u2019s testimony and by assumptions in the Respondent\u2019s Reply that were unchallenged. Mr. Parker was not familiar with the mechanics of the CHT Arrangement.\n[5] The CHT Arrangement is a gifting arrangement tax shelter that operated from 2004 until the end of 2008. 2040126 Ontario Inc., operating as World Health Initiatives, was the promoter (the \u201cPromoter\u201d).\n[6] The stated purpose of the CHT Arrangement was to provide support for recognized Canadian charitable organizations and to assist in the international relief of poverty by offering humanitarian aid, in the form of pharmaceuticals, for distribution in developing countries.\n[7] Under the CHT Arrangement, a participant taxpayer would make a cash contribution to a registered charity (\u201cCash Charity\u201d) and receive a charitable donation receipt for the amount of cash donated. For Mr. Parker, the Cash Charity was Phoenix Community Works Foundation and the cash donation receipt was for $14,612.\n[8] The participant would, at the same time, complete an application to become a \u201cClass A\u201d beneficiary of one of the CH trusts, which entitled them to receive a stipulated number of World Health Organization Essential Medicine units (\u201cWHOEM Units\u201d), subject to a lien.\n[9] The certificate for the WHOEM Units issued to each individual purported to reflect ownership in an attached list of pharmaceuticals. The list indicated the pharmaceuticals\u2019 purported value; the lien amount was also noted. For Mr. Parker, the trust was CH Trust XVIII, he was entitled to 52 WHOEM Units with a stated value of $52,449.12 with an \u201cencumberance[sic]\u201d of $8,320. The trustee of the trust was CET Fiduciary Services Ltd. and the settlor of the trust was Crunin Investments Limited BVI (\u201cCrunin\u201d).\n[10] Following receipt of the WHOEM Units, the participant would execute a deed of gift of the purportedly owned pharmaceuticals in favour of a registered charity (the \u201cIn-Kind Charity\u201d) that would issue a receipt for the purported value of the pharmaceuticals. For Mr. Parker, the deed of gift would have stated that he transferred pharmaceuticals acquired through the CHT Arrangement (the \u201cPharmaceuticals\u201d) to the Choson Kallah Fund of Toronto (\u201cCKF\u201d). The receipt issued by the CKF was in the amount of $44,129 (the \u201cCKF Receipt\u201d).\n[11] The In-Kind Charity was in turn to transfer the Pharmaceuticals to another charity (the \u201cDistributing Charity\u201d). The Distributing Charity was to distribute the Pharmaceuticals to various non-governmental organizations in Africa, South America and Asia to be used for humanitarian aid. The Respondent did not dispute that some pharmaceuticals were purchased, warehoused and distributed outside of Canada as part of the CHT Arrangement.\n[12] It was not contemplated that Crunin or any participant would take physical possession of pharmaceuticals. Rather, Crunin, the settlor of the CH Trusts, purported to purchase all the pharmaceuticals in bulk from KP Innovispharm Limited (\u201cKP Innovispharm\u201d), a Cyprian company, by taking title. KP Innovispharm allegedly purchased pharmaceuticals from manufacturers outside Canada.\n[13] By Notice of Reassessment dated March 12, 2009, the Minister disallowed the Appellant\u2019s claimed donations in the CHT Arrangement for the 2006 taxation year. On April 7, 2009, the Appellant objected to the reassessment. By Notice of Reassessment dated November 27, 2014, the Minister allowed the Appellant\u2019s claim for a charitable tax credit based on the cash donation.\nIII. ISSUE\n[14] At issue is whether the Appellant\u2019s alleged donation of Pharmaceuticals (with a purported value of $44,129) to the CKF is a charitable gift for purposes of the charitable gift tax credit in subsection 118.1(3) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[6]\nIV. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS\n[15] The Appellant submits that he donated Pharmaceuticals with a value of $44,129 to the CKF and is entitled to a corresponding charitable tax credit.\n[16] The Respondent submits that the alleged donation of Pharmaceuticals does not qualify as a charitable gift and the Appellant is not entitled to a charitable tax credit. The Respondent made various arguments in the Reply,[7] but at the hearing chose to rely on the following arguments:\nThere was no \u201cgift\u201d of the Pharmaceuticals to a charity; the Appellant did not acquire the Pharmaceuticals and therefore could not donate the Pharmaceuticals to a charity;[8]\nThe Appellant did not have \u201cdonative intent\u201d;[9]\nThe receipt for the purported gift does not comply with sections 3500 and 3501 of the Income Tax Regulations;[10]\nThe principle of judicial comity should apply, since there has been a thorough review of the CHT Arrangement and these issues by Justice Owen in Morrison.[11]\nV. ANALYSIS\n(a) Morrison and Eisbrenner\n[17] In Morrison, the Tax Court of Canada considered the denial of charitable donation tax credits claimed by Mr. Morrison and Mr. Eisbrenner in relation to their participation in the CHT Arrangement and the reduction of a charitable donation tax credit that Mr. Morrison had claimed in relation to his participation in the Canadian Gift Initiatives donation program (\u201cCGI Program\u201d). The appeals were heard on common evidence.\n[18] The Minister had denied Mr. Morrison\u2019s and Mr. Eisbrenner\u2019s tax credit in respect of both the cash donation and the purported donation of pharmaceuticals in the CHT Arrangement. The Minister had determined the fair market value of pharmaceuticals donated by Mr. Morrison in the CGI Program to be less than claimed and accordingly reduced the amount of the charitable donation tax credit. The CGI Program is not relevant to Mr. Parker\u2019s appeal.\n[19] The Tax Court allowed the appellants\u2019 appeals with respect to the cash donations in the CHT Arrangement and dismissed the appellants\u2019 appeals with respect to the purported in-kind donations of pharmaceuticals. Owen, J. found that the appellants had not established that they had acquired the pharmaceuticals that were purportedly gifted to the in-kind charity, that there was no delivery or transfer of property, and therefore no gift. The Tax Court also dismissed Mr. Morrison\u2019s appeal with respect to the charitable donation tax credit for participation in the CGI Program.\n[20] In Eisbrenner, the Federal Court of Appeal considered the appeals by Mr. Morrison and Mr. Eisbrenner from the decision of the Tax Court. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that the Tax Court Judge did not err in his findings (with respect to the CGI Program for Mr. Morrison and with respect to the CHT Arrangement for both appellants) and dismissed the appeals. The appellants sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was denied.[12]\n[21] In both Morrison and Eisbrenner, issues relating to the role of assumptions and onus of proof in tax cases, relating to certain assumptions made in the Minister\u2019s replies, and the admissibility into evidence of certain invoices and bank documents obtained by the CRA on audit, were considered by the Courts. Before considering the central issues in the appeal, I address these same two procedural issues which were also raised at Mr. Parker\u2019s hearing.\n(b) Preliminary Matter - Admissibility of Documentary Evidence\n[22] The Respondent sought to have the following documents admitted into evidence as proof of the truth of their contents:[13]\nBanking documents, including bank statements, from the Bank of Cyprus (\u201cBank Documents\u201d);[14]\nInvoices obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturers located outside Canada (\u201cInvoices\u201d);[15] and\nTwo summaries (prepared by the Canada Revenue Agency) of the above documents (\u201cSummaries\u201d).[16]\n[23] The Appellant did not object to the admission of these documents into evidence. The Respondent confirmed, and I accept, that the Bank Documents and the Invoices were identical to the documents admitted as evidence in Morrison. One of the Summaries is substantially the same as one of the summaries admitted as evidence in Morrison; the other Summary in this proceeding does not correspond directly to the other summary admitted into evidence in Morrison.[17]\n[24] The Bank Documents for KP Innovispharm, Hever International, Bonatrust Services Limited and PK Bonopharm from the Bank of Cyprus were obtained following a request made by the Canadian Competent Authority to the Cyprus Competent Authority.[18] Mr. Monahan testified that while the CRA was able to determine that some of the money received through cash donations to the CHT Arrangement was used to buy pharmaceuticals,[19] they were purchased by Amstelfarma, PK Bonapharm and Medpharm. The CRA did not find any evidence in the Bank Documents that any funds moved from KP Innovispharm to the pharmaceutical manufacturing companies.[20] The Respondent submits that the Bank Documents are relevant to the issue of whether any pharmaceuticals were acquired by Crunin\/the CH Trusts or KP Innovispharm and therefore the Appellant.\n[25] Mr. Monahan testified that he was able to identify the batches of pharmaceuticals associated with the CHT Arrangement and then identify the manufacturers of those pharmaceuticals. He contacted the manufacturers directly, and requested copies of invoices for the sales of the pharmaceuticals. The CRA obtained the Invoices directly from the pharmaceutical manufacturers and through Competent Authority requests in the relevant jurisdictions.\n[26] The Respondent submits that the Invoices reflect that the only purchasers of the pharmaceuticals that the CRA identified as part of the CHT Arrangement were MedPharm, Amstelfarma (the owner of the warehouse in Holland) and PK Bonapharm.[21] Mr. Monahan testified that the CRA did not find any evidence that the pharmaceuticals identified in connection with the CHT Arrangement were purchased by Crunin\/the CH Trusts or KP Innovispharm.[22] The Respondent submits that the Invoices are relevant to the issue of whether any pharmaceuticals were acquired by Crunin\/the CH Trusts or KP Innovispharm and therefore the Appellant.\n[27] The Summaries are Tab M: CHT 2004, 2005 and 2006 Combined Cash Analysis[23] and Tab N: KPI Cash Flow.[24] According to Mr. Monahan, Tab M shows that out of the $222 million of cash donated by the participants from 2004-2006, $204 million went to the Promoter\u2019s trust account, $11.06 million went to the accounts of WHI, and only $6.994 million \u2013 3% of the $222 million - went to the three different classes of charities, with 1% kept for the distributing charity\u2019s own purposes.[25] Tab N shows that \u201cno more than about 10 or 11 million Canadian of the 116 million dollars was actually funneled to a legitimate pharmaceutical company\u201d.[26] The Respondent submits that the Summaries are therefore also relevant to the issue of whether any pharmaceuticals were acquired by Crunin\/the CH Trusts or KP Innovispharm and therefore the Appellant.\n[28] In Morrison, the Tax Court provided oral reasons[27] in support of the conclusion that the Bank Documents and Invoices were authentic, relevant and admissible into evidence as proof of their contents under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. The Tax Court also admitted into evidence two summaries, done by the CRA, as support of the audit work that had been done, but not for the truth of the contents.[28] On appeal, in Eisbrenner, the appellants alleged that the trial judge had erred in allowing the Bank Documents and Invoices to be admitted. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that there was no basis for interference with the Tax Court \u2019s finding of admissibility.\n[29] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the Bank Documents, Invoices and Summaries should be admitted into evidence on the same basis as and for the reasons provided by the Tax Court in Morrison, as upheld on appeal. They also submit that since this matter is under the Tax Court \u2019s informal procedure, this Court has broader discretion regarding the admissibility of hearsay evidence pursuant to subsection 18.15(3) of the Tax Court of Canada Act (\u201cTCC Act\u201d). The Appellant did not make submissions on the admissibility of the documents into evidence.\n[30] The documents must be authentic.[29] There is no reason to believe that the Bank Documents or the Invoices are other than what the purport to be. Mr. Monahan testified as to the process by which these documents were obtained. There is no reason to believe that the Bank of Cyprus or the Cyprian Competent Authority would provide anything other than the banking documents requested by the Canadian Competent Authority,[30] or that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would provide anything other than the invoices requested by the CRA audit group directly or through Competent Authority.[31] I accept the Bank Documents and Invoices as authentic.\n[31] In Morrison, the Tax Court found the same documents to be authentic.[32] That determination was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner.[33]\n[32] The documents must be relevant to a material issue.[34] The Invoices are relevant to determining whether the Appellant had title to the Pharmaceuticals, allegedly acquired through KP Innovispharm and Crunin\/the CH Trust. The Bank Documents are relevant to determining the flow of funds for the purchase of pharmaceuticals from the manufacturers and whether any of the pharmaceuticals were purchased by Crunin\/the CH Trust or KP Innovispharm and subsequently acquired by the Appellant. I accept that the Bank Documents and the Invoices are potentially relevant to whether the Appellant acquired the Pharmaceuticals.\n[33] In Morrison, the Tax Court found the same documents to be relevant.[35] That determination was not in issue before the Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner.[36]\n[34] The Respondent acknowledges that the contents of the Bank Documents and Invoices are hearsay and presumptively inadmissible. The Respondent sought to have the documents admitted under the principled exception to the hearsay rule or subsection 18.15(3) of the TCC Act.[37]\n[35] Under the principled exception to the hearsay rule,[38] hearsay evidence may be admitted if it meets the criteria of threshold reliability and necessity. Threshold reliability is concerned with procedural safeguards or circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,[39] which has two aspects: \u201cwhether the circumstances tend to negate inaccuracy and fabrication and whether the circumstances provide the trier of fact with a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth about the facts to be proven.\u201d[40] Necessity must be applied flexibly and does not require that the proposed hearsay evidence is the only evidence available.[41] It can be mere \u201cexpediency or convenience\u201d when there are very high circumstantial guarantees of reliability.[42]\n[36] The Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner[43] describes the Tax Court \u2019s reasons on the principled exception to the hearsay rule in Morrison:\n[57] During the hearing, the Tax Court Judge provided detailed reasons in support of his conclusion that the invoices and the bank statements were admissible into evidence as proof of the truth of their contents under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. The Tax Court Judge referred to the decision of Cromwell, J.A. (as he then was) writing on behalf of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wilcox, 2001 NSCA 45, 192 N.S.R. (2d) 159 and to the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Lemay, 2004 BCCA 604, 247 D.L.R. (4th) 470.\n[37] The Tax Court \u2019s determination that the Bank Documents and Invoices were admissible into evidence as proof of the truth of their contents under the principled exception to the hearsay rule was upheld by Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner.[44]\n[38] In R v. Wilcox[45] and R v. Lemay[46], the Courts applied the principled exception to admit business records for the truth of their contents. In R v. Wilcox, Cromwell J.A. (as he then was) wrote for the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal:\n[66] Threshold reliability is not directly concerned with whether the contents of the statement are true, but with whether the circumstances surrounding the statement provide circumstantial guarantees of its trustworthiness: see Starr per Iacobucci, J. at p. 534. The question of whether such guarantees are present has two aspects which reflect the underlying rationalia of the hearsay rule and most of its traditional exceptions. The first concerns whether the statement was made in circumstances tending to negate inaccuracy or fabrication. Factors such as the absence of any motive on the part of the declarant to fabricate the evidence are relevant to this inquiry: see e.g. Starr, supra, at \u00a7 214 - 215. The second aspect of threshold reliability is concerned with whether the statement was made in circumstances which provide the trier of fact with a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement: see e.g. Hawkins, supra at \u00a7 75. Consideration of threshold reliability requires an examination of the specific hearsay dangers raised by the statement and determination of whether the facts surrounding it \u201c...offer sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to compensate for these dangers.\u201d: see Hawkins, supra at \u00a7 75. The focus, however, remains on circumstances related to the statement itself, not on extraneous matters relevant to ultimate reliability such as whether there is other confirmatory evidence or on the reputation for truthfulness of the declarant.\n[67] As mentioned earlier, traditional hearsay exceptions may be of assistance in identifying factors which may or may not serve as circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. With respect to business records, the routine nature of their creation, the fact that they are relied on for business purposes and the absence of any motive to misrepresent the information recorded have all been identified in the traditional hearsay exception as factors which provide some circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness justifying reception for its truth of the hearsay contents of such records.[47]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[39] I find that the necessity requirement has been met. As stated in Wilcox, it is not essential to establish that the proposed hearsay evidence would not otherwise be available in a non-hearsay format where there are high circumstantial guarantees of reliability, which I believe to be present. Nonetheless, as the Tax Court Judge observed in Morrison[48]:\nEven if witnesses from the PMCs [pharmaceutical manufacturing companies] and the bank were called to speak to the documents, it is highly unlikely that they could provide any information regarding the content of the documents beyond that which is stated in the documents. Accordingly, if the documents are not admitted as proof of the truth of the contents, this evidence would not be available to this Court\u201d.\n[40] I also find that the threshold reliability requirement is met. Here, the Bank Documents and the Invoices would have been prepared and relied on in the ordinary course of the business of the bank or the pharmaceutical manufacturers, as applicable. The circumstances surrounding their creation provides a guarantee of trustworthiness with respect to the information in the documents. Neither the bank nor the pharmaceutical manufacturers had a motive to falsify or fabricate these business records, since neither has any interest in the outcome of the appeal.\n[41] With respect to the admissibility of the Summaries, the Respondent referred the Court to R v. Scheel[49], a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In that decision, the Court confirmed that a summary of books and records, based on evidence which had been properly admitted, was admissible as an aid in understanding the entire picture represented by voluminous documentary evidence. The usefulness of the summaries depended entirely upon the proof of the facts upon which the summaries were based. In Morrison, the Trial Judge admitted two CRA summaries into evidence, as summaries of the auditor\u2019s work, one of which was substantially similar to Tab N.[50]\n[42] Tab N is a summary prepared by the CRA of information in the Bank Documents. Tab M is a summary of CRA\u2019s conclusions on cash flow based on information apparently gathered from the Bank Documents and other sources. Both of these documents are helpful to demonstrate the audit work done and support Mr. Monahan\u2019s testimony as to the CRA\u2019s conclusions and are admissible into evidence on that basis.\n[43] In summary, the Bank Statements and the Invoices are admissible as proof of the truth of the contents under the principled exception to the hearsay rule, because they meet the threshold reliability and necessity requirements. The Summaries are admissible as evidence of the audit work done.\n[44] Subsection 18.15(3) of the TCC Act concerns procedure with respect to a hearing under the informal procedure in the Tax Court , and provides that the strict rules of evidence do not apply. The provision reads as follows:\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the Act under which the appeal arises, the Court is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting a hearing and the appeal shall be dealt with by the Court as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit.\u201d\n[45] As the Federal Court of Appeal determined in Selmeci[51], under subsection 18.15(3) of the TCC Act, a Tax Court Judge has greater latitude for the admission of hearsay evidence in a hearing under the informal procedure: \u201cthe Tax Court Judge has a broader discretion and may admit hearsay evidence even though it would not, for example, be sufficiently necessary to satisfy Khan, supra but is nonetheless relevant and reliable.\u201d[52] In Khan[53], it was held that a Trial Judge may admit evidence, once satisfied that it is necessary and reliable, notwithstanding that it is hearsay and inadmissible under one of the exceptions to the exclusionary hearsay rule.\n[46] Given my conclusion on the admissibility of the Bank Statements and Invoices under the principled exception to the hearsay rule, I need not resort to a potentially more lenient standard for admissibility of evidence in an informal procedure hearing. My conclusion on the admissibility of the Summaries does not change when having regard to subsection 18.15(3) of the TCC Act.\n(c) Preliminary Matter \u2013 Burden of Proof regarding the Assumptions of Fact\n[47] The issue of onus of proof in tax appeals was thoroughly canvassed by the Tax Court in Morrison[54], and by the Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner[55]. As the Federal Court of Appeal observed, the issue is particularly important because of the limited evidence in relation to the ownership of the pharmaceuticals and how (or whether) the CH Trusts acquired the pharmaceuticals which they purported to convey to the participants. As will be apparent later in these reasons, a central issue in this appeal is whether Mr. Parker owned the Pharmaceuticals and transferred ownership of the Pharmaceuticals to the In-Kind Charity, CKF.\n[48] As in Morrison, the Appellant here had no knowledge of how the CHT Arrangement worked and whether or how he might have come to own the Pharmaceuticals that he purported to donate to the CKF.\n[49] In Eisbrenner, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that since the appellant had pleaded in the notice of appeal that he had acquired ownership of certain pharmaceuticals and transferred those pharmaceuticals to the in-kind charity, he had the onus of proving that he owned the particular pharmaceuticals on a balance of probabilities. The Court stated that it relied on the well-established principle in civil cases that the person alleging must prove.[56]\n[50] Here, I need not examine the role of the appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal with respect to the onus of proof and the suggestion, by the Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner, that what is pleaded may shift the burden of proof away from the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact towards the facts pleaded by the taxpayer.[57] Here, as in many appeals under the Tax Court\u2019s informal procedure, the Notice of Appeal contains few asserted facts, and none regarding the ownership or transfer of the Pharmaceuticals. The facts assumed by the Minister and stated in the Reply are the only facts supporting the assessment of the Appellant.\n[51] Accordingly, I rely on the general principle that the initial onus is on the taxpayer to \u201cdemolish\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions by at least establishing a prima facie case that the Minister\u2019s assumptions are incorrect. In Hickman Motors Ltd. v. R[58], at p. 5376, Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 describes this process:\nIt is trite law that in taxation the standard of proof is the civil balance of probabilities \u2026 The Minister, in making assessments, proceeds on assumptions \u2026 and the initial onus is on the taxpayer to \u201cdemolish\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions in the assessment \u2026 The initial burden is only to \u201cdemolish\u201d the exact assumptions made by the Minister but no more \u2026 .\nThis initial onus of \u201cdemolishing\u201d the Minister\u2019s exact assumptions is met where the appellant makes out at least a prima facie case \u2026 The law is settled that unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence \u201cdemolishes\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions \u2026 .\n[Emphasis added.]\n[52] Recently, in Kufsky v. Canada[59], the Federal Court of Appeal (in concurring reasons of Monahan, J.) referred to its decision in Amiante Spec Inc. v. Canada[60], where the Court explains a prima facie case as follows:\n[23]A prima facie case is one \u201csupported by evidence which raises such a degree of probability in its favour that it must be accepted if believed by the Court unless it is rebutted or the contrary is proved. It may be contrasted with conclusive evidence which excludes the possibility of the truth of any other conclusion than the one established by that evidence\u201d (Stewart v. Canada, 2000 CanLII 426 (TCC), [2000] T.C.J. No. 53, paragraph 23).\n[24] Although it is not conclusive evidence, \u201cthe burden of proof put on the taxpayer is not to be lightly, capriciously or casually shifted\u201d, considering that \u201c[i]t is the taxpayer\u2019s business\u201d (Orly Automobiles Inc. v. Canada, 2005 FCA 425, paragraph 20).\n[53] There are exceptions to the general rule. There may be situations where fairness requires the burden to be shifted away from the taxpayer, including where the pleaded assumptions of fact are exclusively or peculiarly within the knowledge of the Minister.[61] I agree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that this is not the case here. I have determined, as did the Tax Court in Morrison[62], that the relevant facts with respect to the CHT Arrangement are not exclusively or peculiarly known by the Minister. While the Minister, having done a thorough audit, acquired a detailed understanding of the CHT Arrangement, and the Appellant did not, it was potentially open to the Appellant to find out more. The facts would have been known by others involved in the CHT Arrangement and were not within the exclusive or peculiar knowledge of the Minister, even if not known by the Appellant. It would not be unfair to the Appellant here to allow the Minister to assume facts relating to the details of the CHT Arrangement.\n[54] I therefore conclude that, consistent with the principles set out above, the initial onus is on the Appellant to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact as stated in the Reply by making out a prima facie case that \u201cdemolishes\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions.\n[55] Next, I consider the legal issues central to the appeal.\n(d) Validity of the Receipt\n[56] The Respondent submits that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the CKF Receipt was deficient.\n[57] Paragraph 118.1(2)(a) of the Act requires that a gift be evidenced by filing with the Minister a receipt that contains prescribed information. Subsection 248(1) of the Act specifies that the term \u201cprescribed\u201d means prescribed by regulation or determined in accordance with rules prescribed by regulation. Part XXXV of the Income Tax Regulations (\u201cRegulations\u201d)[63] contains the relevant provisions. Section 3501 provides a list of requirements for an official receipt to be treated as valid for purposes of claiming a charitable donation tax credit.\n[58] This Court[64] and the Federal Court of Appeal[65] have, on numerous occasions, commented on the strict nature of the requirements. Lack of compliance with any of these requirements is fatal to a claim for a charitable donation tax credit.\n[59] In the recent decision of Kueviakoe, the Federal Court of Appeal refers to various cases[66] and endorses the following passage from the Tax Court decision of Plante[67]:\n[46] The requirements in question are not frivolous or unimportant; on the contrary, the information required is fundamental, and absolutely necessary for checking both that the indicated value is accurate and that the gift was actually made.\n[47] The purpose of such requirements is to prevent abuses of any kind. They are the minimum requirements for defining the kind of gift that can qualify the taxpayer making it for a tax deduction.\n[48] If the requirements as to the nature of the information that a receipt must contain are not met, the receipt must be rejected, with the result that the holder of the receipt loses tax benefits. [...]\n[60] Here, the Respondent submits that the CKF Receipt is not a valid receipt as it does not show the place or locality where the receipt was issued as required by paragraph 3501(1)(d) of the Regulations. I agree. The receipt Mr. Parker received from CKF[68] has the charity\u2019s address but does not have the address where the receipt was issued.\n[61] A similar issue arose in in Kueviakoe. The Federal Court of Appeal determined that where a receipt does not separately indicate the place of issuance of the receipt, it must be rejected as non-compliant.[69] The address of the charity is not enough; a receipt issuing address must be listed separately.[70]\n[62] As such, the CKF Receipt does not meet the requirements of paragraph 3501(1)(d) of the Regulations and is invalid. This determination is sufficient to dismiss the Appellant\u2019s appeal. However, since much of the hearing was spent on the Appellant\u2019s purported gift of Pharmaceuticals to the CKF, I have addressed the parties\u2019 submissions on whether there was a gift.\n(e) Gift\n(i) The Legislation\n[63] Subsection 118.1(3) of the Act[71] allows an individual to claim a tax credit with respect to gifts made to a registered charity. The amount of the tax credit is determined by the amount of the gift. A tax credit cannot exceed the amount of the gift.\n(ii) The Elements of a Gift\n[64] \u201cGift\u201d is not defined in the Act. The essential elements have been established in the case law. In Friedberg[72], the Federal Court of Appeal wrote:\n\u201cThus, a gift is a voluntary transfer of property owned by a donor to a donee, in return for which no benefit or consideration flows to the donor.\u201d[73]\n[65] In McNamee v. McNamee[74], the Ontario Court of Appeal elaborated on the essential elements of a \u201cgift\u201d:\n24. The essential ingredients of a legally valid gift are not in dispute. There must be (1) an intention to make a gift on the part of the donor, without consideration or expectation of remuneration, (2) an acceptance of the gift by the donee, and (3) a sufficient act of delivery or transfer of the property to complete the transaction.[75]\n[66] According to these definitions, there are three elements of a gift:\nThere must be a voluntary transfer of property;\nThe property must be owned by the donor immediately prior to the transfer; and\nThere must be an intention to make a gift by the donor, without a benefit or consideration or expectation of remuneration to the donor, often referred to as \u201cdonative intent\u201d.[76]\n(iii) Ownership and Transfer of Property\n[67] The Respondent submits that an essential element of a gift is missing \u2013 that there was no transfer of property by the Appellant to the CKF.[77] The Respondent submits that the Appellant never acquired the Pharmaceuticals and therefore was unable to donate them.\n[68] The Respondent makes the following assumptions in the Reply with respect to the ownership and alleged transfer of pharmaceuticals, applicable to all participants in the CHT Arrangement, which includes Mr. Parker:\n12.44 the participants never took physical possession of any Pharmaceuticals;\n12.45 the participants never acquired title to any Pharmaceuticals;\n12.46 the In-kind Charities never took possession of any Pharmaceuticals in Canada;\n12.47 none of the Pharmaceuticals ever entered Canada;\n12.48 the CHT Trusts never acquired title to the Pharmaceuticals;\n12.49 the Settlor reported purchasing all the Pharmaceuticals in bulk from a Cyprian company, K.P. Innovispharm Limited;\n12.50 the Pharmaceuticals were manufactured and purchased in a market outside of Canada and were distributed from the offshore manufacturers to third world countries for the purposes of humanitarian relief;\n12.51 the Pharmaceuticals were never intended to be imported into Canada;\n12.52 the Pharmaceuticals were never intended to be used by Canadian consumers;\n[69] The Respondent makes the following assumptions in the Reply with respect to the alleged transfer of Pharmaceuticals by Mr. Parker to the CKF:\n12.61 the Appellant neither took possession of, nor acquired title to, any Pharmaceuticals;\n12.62 the Appellant signed a Deed of Gift stating that the Appellant transferred Pharmaceuticals acquired through the CHT Arrangement to the Choson Kallah Fund of Toronto.\n[70] No assumptions were made with respect to possession, title or ownership of Pharmaceuticals by KP Innovispharm or Crunin\/the CH Trust or with respect to the Sale and Supply Agreement between KP Innovispharm and Crunin\/the CH Trust.\n[71] Mr. Parker agrees that he never took possession of any pharmaceuticals. He disputes that he did not acquire title to the Pharmaceuticals. He believed that he owned the Pharmaceuticals. The Appellant offered as evidence the certificate received from Canadian Humanitarian Trust XVIII (the \u201cCertificate\u201d).[78]\n[72] The Certificate indicates that Mr. Parker is entitled to receive a distribution of 52 WHOEM Units and that Mr. Parker is the owner of the units set out in the attached schedule. The schedule lists various pharmaceuticals with amounts, indicated as their \u201cprice\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d. The total \u201cpharmaceutical value\u201d indicated is $52,449.12 with an \u201cencumberance[sic]\u201d of $8,320. The net amount is $44,129.\n[73] The Certificate provided by Mr. Parker was photocopied, and included pages 1, 3 and 5 but is missing pages 2 and 4. Based on what appear to be identical certificates, for Canadian Humanitarian Trusts XI and XVI introduced into evidence as sample certificates[79], and also as the appellants\u2019 certificates in Morrison\/Eisbrenner[80] one would expect to see three endorsements\/ \u201cdeeds of transfer\u201d on the missing second page. The first endorsement\/deed of transfer in the sample certificate provides:\nI hereby transfer, give, assign, convey and deliver any and all title to my Units listed herein, to Choson Kallah Fund of Toronto unconditionally and absolutely. For this purpose, I further state that it is my intention that such rights vest absolutely in the aforesaid Units as of the date of this deed of transfer, subject only to a lien against the title of said Units.\nDelivery of a copy of this deed of transfer shall serve as good and sufficient authority to complete the transfer and conveyance of the Units to the above noted on my behalf.\n[74] There is a place for the date, signature of transferor and the name of the transferee. In the sample certificates, this endorsement\/deed of transfer was signed by the participant.\n[75] The second endorsement\/deed of transfer provides for a further assignment, apparently to the distributing charity.\n[76] There is a place for the date, signature of transferor and the name of the further transferee. In the sample certificates, this endorsement\/deed of transfer was signed.\n[77] The third endorsement\/deed of transfer provides for a possible further assignment. There is a place for the date, signature of transferor and the name of the further transferee, however in the sample certificates, this was left blank.\n[78] Without the missing pages, there is no evidence of the purported transfer of the WHOEM Units from Mr. Parker to CKF, although the Minister assumed in the Reply that there was such a deed of transfer signed by the Appellant. Even if a full copy of the Certificate had been provided with the endorsement\/deed of transfer of the WHOEM Units to the CKF signed by Mr. Parker, it would not affect my conclusions reached further below.\n[79] In Morrison, the certificates were found to be \u201cworthless pieces of paper\u201d, because pharmaceuticals were not acquired by KP Innovispharm at the start of the acquisition chain:\n152 Based on the totality of the evidence of Mr. Monahan regarding the results of the audit of the CHT Program and the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I conclude that the certificates received by the Appellants from CHT are not reliable evidence that pharmaceuticals were acquired by CHT and were distributed by CHT to the Appellants. I find as a fact that the certificates were simply worthless pieces of paper used by WHI to give participants in the CHT Program the impression that pharmaceuticals passed from CHT to the participants and from the participants to the in-kind charities when in fact the pharmaceuticals associated with the CHT Program were sold by the manufacturers of those pharmaceuticals directly to offshore entities, were accumulated in a warehouse in Holland and were then distributed to charities in various countries to provide a veneer of charitable activity which WHI (through CDL) could use to market the CHT Program.\n[Emphasis added]\n[80] After reviewing the content of the certificate, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the certificates were \u201cworthless pieces of paper\u201d.[81]\n[81] The Respondent here, like in Morrison, points to an absence of evidence for the purported acquisition of pharmaceuticals by KP Innovispharm from the manufacturers. KP Innovispharm was, according to the CHT Arrangement, to transfer the pharmaceuticals to Crunin, the settlor, who was to settle the pharmaceuticals on the CH Trust, through which the pharmaceuticals were purportedly distributed to the beneficiaries of the trust\/participants in the CHT Arrangement. Without a purchase by KP Innovispharm, there is a missing link in the purported chain of transfers.\n[82] Mr. Monahan testified to his belief that all of the drugs that were purchased through the CHT Arrangement were used for humanitarian purposes; however, the CRA found no evidence whatsoever to support a conclusion that KP Innovispharm (or any other person or entity associated with the CHT Arrangement) bought the pharmaceuticals and sold the pharmaceuticals to Crunin. With KP Innovispharm not part of the chain, there was no transfer of title or ownership to Crunin\/CH Trust; the whole chain breaks. The CRA reviewed thousands of documents but none showed KP Innovispharm involvement.\n[83] Mr. Monahan testified that, when contacted by the CRA, the manufacturers responded that they had never heard of KP Innovispharm, had never dealt with it, and had never received a purchase order from it. The following excerpts are from the examination of Mr. Monahan by the Respondent\u2019s counsel:\nQ. And- so you mentioned that during the course of the audit, you had contacted the promoters.\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. And you asked for invoicing shipment information- any documents demonstrating that anyone associated with CHT actually came into possession of pharmaceuticals, is that right?\nA. That\u2019s correct. [82]\n\u2026\nQ. So what did the promoters eventually provide you?\nA. Well, right from the beginning, the promoters provided us with a document called the Certificate of Analysis- do you want me to expand on that?[83]\n\u2026\nQ. Okay. So you\u2019re provided these certificates. Do these certificates show who the buyer was?\nA. No. The certificates are strictly a technical document. So the information I laid out, batch number, manufacturer, manufacturing date, products, things like that- raw materials, I should say. But no information on purchaser, no information on- it would say the quantity of the batch, for example, but beyond that, no.\nQ. Okay. So equipped with these certificates of analysis, what was the next step in your audit?[84]\nA. Well, \u2026 and then we wrote to the manufacturers, to each one of them, and requested their assistance explaining that we were told that a company named KP Innovis Pharm had purchased pharmaceuticals and were reselling them. And these are the batch numbers that were identified, and asked them for various support documents, purchase invoices, shipping documents, the invoices- everything.[85]\n\u2026\nQ. And what was the response you received from the pharmaceuticals for the 2004, 2005, and 2006 years?\nA. The responses were good. Most of the manufacturers were very cooperative. Some we had to make subsequent requests to the competent authority, but the one consistent response was that no one had ever heard of KP Innovis Pharm, had never dealt with them, had never received a purchase order from them or communication. They were never referenced in any other communication. [86]\n\u2026\nMR. ZSIGO: Q. Yes. So Mr. Monahan, we\u2019ve identified various entities associated with the CHT tax shelter, correct?\nA. Correct.\nQ. Cruden Investments.\nA. Yes.\nQ. KPI.\nA. Yes.\nQ.Various charities.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Right. Did you come across any documentation, whether it be shipping or invoicing, showing that any of these entities associated with the implementation of the CHT tax shelters came into either physical possession or had some other legal title or possessory interest over pharmaceuticals?\nA. No, I have not.\nQ. Okay.[87]\n\u2026\nMR. ZSIGO: Q. Mr. Monahan, do you want to elaborate- or is there anything- since you\u2019re on the stand, is there any clarification you want to make in that regard?\nA. Yeah, I think the point was that we had tried for a very long time to establish the ownership team. \u2026\n\u2026\nA. \u2026 We did expect to see that KPI was the purchaser from the manufacturers, but what we- we were never able to find a document that showed that KPI purchased those drugs. \u2026 but what we were able to show is that KP Innovis Pharm didn\u2019t become part of that chain. And so if they didn\u2019t have the legal title, they didn\u2019t have the ability to write that Sale and Supply Agreement to Cruden and sell those drugs legally to Cruden. And if they didn\u2019t, then the whole chain broke down. They couldn\u2019t transfer title to the trustee, the trustee couldn\u2019t distribute from the trust, et cetera, et cetera, because that ownership chain had already been broken. We attempted to find that, we looked for it, it wasn\u2019t there. It was nowhere. And we had- as I think I said earlier, we had thousands of documents, and nothing showed KP Innovis Pharm\u2019s involvement.[88]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[84] With reference to the Invoices introduced into evidence in this hearing, the Respondent asked the Court to make the same finding made by the Tax Court in Morrison that:\n150 \u2026 None of the Invoices provided by the manufacturers indicate a sale of the pharmaceuticals to KP Innovispharm, Crunin or CHT, nor do they refer to delivery of the pharmaceuticals to KP Innovispharm, Crunin or CHT.\n[85] On the evidence before me, I come to the same conclusion.\n[86] Similarly, with reference to the Bank Documents introduced into evidence in this hearing, the Respondent submits, and I agree, that the Bank Documents do not reflect cash flow from KP Innovispharm, Crunin or CH Trust to the pharmaceutical manufacturers for a purchase of pharmaceuticals.\n[87] The Tax Court in Morrison concluded, based on the totality of the evidence regarding the results of the audit of the CHT Arrangement and the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the certificates were not reliable evidence that the pharmaceuticals were acquired by CH Trust and distributed to the appellants. The Tax Court concluded that Mr. Morrison did not make a gift in-kind of pharmaceuticals: \u201cSimply stated, regardless of the representations of WHI in the CHT Program materials (including the certificates), the Appellants had no pharmaceuticals to gift \u2026 [to Choson Kallah Fund]\u201d[89]. The Tax Court \u2019s conclusion that Mr. Morrison did not own the pharmaceuticals that he purported to donate to the in-kind charity was upheld on appeal, in Eisbrenner.[90]\n[88] Based on the testimony of Mr. Monahan at this hearing regarding the audit of the CHT Arrangement, and the absence of any evidence that pharmaceuticals were acquired by KP Innovispharm, I have concluded that the Certificate received by the Appellant is not reliable evidence that pharmaceuticals were acquired by CHT XVIII and distributed by CHT XVIII to the Appellant. Accordingly, I have concluded that the Appellant did not own the Pharmaceuticals that he claimed he donated to the CKF. The onus is on the Appellant to demolish the assumption made by the Minister that he had no legal title to the pharmaceuticals. I have determined that the Appellant has not presented a prima facie case to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumption.\n[89] I have concluded that the Appellant did not transfer property and therefore did not make a gift to the CKF. On this basis alone, the Appellant\u2019s appeal also fails.\n(f) Donative Intent\n[90] The Respondent\u2019s further alternative argument is that the purported transfer of pharmaceuticals to the CKF does not qualify as a gift because the Appellant did not have a \u201cdonative intent\u201d to make a gift to charity.\n[91] The requirement for donative intent derives from the case law meaning of a \u201cgift\u201d (noted above) as \u201ca voluntary transfer of property by a donor to a donee in return for which no benefit or consideration flows to the donor\u201d.[91]\n[92] The Respondent submits there are two reasons the Appellant lacked donative intent. First, the Appellant \u201cknew he would profit or be enriched by participation in the CHT arrangement\u201d[92]. Stated numerically, the Appellant parted with $14,612 in cash, received tax receipts from charities with a total purported donated amount of $58,741, resulting in a claim for tax credits of $23,563 or a \u201cnet advantage\u201d of $8,951(measured as the amount of the tax credit less the cash donated).[93]\n[93] Second, the Respondent alleges that Mr. Parker lacked donative intent because, as Mr. Parker testified, his motive in participating in the CHT Arrangement was to reduce his taxes.[94] Mr. Parker agreed with the assumption in the Respondent\u2019s Reply (para 12.64) that he \u201centered into the CHT Arrangement to secure a tax benefit exceeding the value of the cash payment and not to make a charitable gift to a registered Canadian charity\u201d. The Respondent did not refer to any case law in support of its submission on donative intent.\n[94] The issue of whether the taxpayer had \u201cdonative intent\u201d arose in Morrison although the context was different. In Morrison, both the cash donation and the in-kind donation for the CHT Arrangement were in issue. The Tax Court considered whether the \u201cinflated tax receipt\u201d for the CHT in-kind donation vitiated Mr. Morrison\u2019s donative intent with respect to the CHT cash donation. The Tax Court cited Castro[95], a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, in support of the proposition that the inflated tax receipt for Mr. Morrison\u2019s alleged in-kind donation was not, in and of itself, a benefit that would vitiate the cash gift. The Tax Court acknowledged that an inflated tax receipt coupled with other circumstances may negate the entitlement to a tax credit, but found that those other circumstances did not exist. The Federal Court of Appeal in Eisbrenner did not address the issue of donative intent as it was not raised on appeal.\n[95] Here, the issue is potentially different from that considered by the Tax Court in Morrison in respect of the CHT Arrangement as a charitable tax credit for Mr. Parker\u2019s cash donation was allowed. There is no longer an issue as to whether an inflated tax receipt for the purported in-kind donation vitiates the cash donation as a gift.\n[96] The only issue that remains is the purported in-kind donation and the Respondent\u2019s argument on \u201cdonative intent\u201d does not acknowledge this fact. Even if the Respondent were to argue that the Appellant lacked donative intent with respect to the in-kind donation, because the Appellant knew that he would profit from that donation by receiving an \u201cinflated\u201d tax receipt, further evidence on the value of the purported in-kind donation and submissions on the relevant law would be required.\n[97] In light of the Respondent\u2019s failure to do so and my conclusion on the Respondent\u2019s other arguments that are each sufficient to dispose of this appeal, I have not considered whether, if the Pharmaceuticals had been transferred to CKF, the Appellant lacked \u201cdonative intent\u201d such that there was no gift.\n(g) Judicial Comity\n[98] The Respondent argues that under the principles of judicial comity, I should follow the decision of Justice Owen in Morrison, unless there is a cogent reason to depart from that decision. They argue that because Mr. Morrison and Mr. Parker both participated in the CHT Arrangement, the present case should have the same result.\n[99] The Federal Court of Appeal summarized this legal concept In Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kassab:[96]\n35 The doctrine of judicial comity operates to prevent the same legal issue from being decided differently by members of the same Court - the doctrine promotes certainty and predictability in the law. The doctrine is a manifestation of the principle of stare decisis. The Federal Court has applied the doctrine, holding that while decisions rendered by colleagues are persuasive and should be given considerable weight, a departure is authorized when a judge is convinced that the prior decision is wrong and can advance cogent reasons in support of this view (Allergan Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health), 2012 FCA 308, 440 N.R. 269 (F.C.A.) at paragraph 47, citing dela Fuente v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2005 FC 992, 276 F.T.R. 241 (F.C.), at paragraph 29 and Stone v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 81, 404 F.T.R. 104 (F.C.), at paragraph 12).\n[100] As reflected in Kassab, judicial comity relates to \u201cthe same legal issue\u201d, and not findings of fact which must clearly be determined exclusively on the basis of the evidence before the trial judge. In this matter, I do not rely on judicial comity because I am bound, due to the pure application of stare decisis, by the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Eisbrenner, with respect to the legal issues decided in that case.\n[101] As already noted, I have followed the guidance in Eisbrenner with respect to the preliminary legal issues of the admissibility of evidence and the role of assumptions. Whether the Appellant transferred property is a question of fact, which I have determined on the basis of the evidence before me. My conclusions on all three issues are consistent with the Tax Court \u2019s conclusions in Morrison. The issue regarding donative intent is different than what was before the Court in Morrison and I did not make a determination. The validity of the CKF Receipt was not before the Court in Morrison or Eisbrenner.\nVI.

The Appellant, Ms. Maria Balatoni, says no. The Respondent says yes. Ms. Balatoni appeals the Respondent\u2019s decision that the chef was engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment in 2018 and 2019 by Ms. Balatoni.\n[2] This set of EI\/CPP appeals relates to work done by one of Ms. Balatoni\u2019s two pastry chefs \u2212 Ms. Tarnai \u2212 in 2018 and 2019. Back in February 2023, I heard a set of EI\/CPP appeals relating to work done by Ms. Balatoni\u2019s other pastry chef, Ms. Csabai, and gave my reasons from the bench.[1] More on that later.\nFindings of Fact [3] Ms. Balatoni owned an industrial kitchen in a commercial building in Markham, Ontario, in which two pastry chefs, each working about 20 hours a week, produced and froze commercial quantities of strudel of various flavours prepared in accordance with Ms. Balatoni\u2019s old family recipe. Ms. Balatoni\u2019s clients were hotels and convention centres. After the strudel was produced, it was frozen and then delivered to the hotel or convention centre where it would be heated and served.\n[4] Ms. Balatoni took three to four days to train each pastry chef how to make the delicate strudel precisely in accordance with her old family recipe. The strudel was made on Ms. Balatoni\u2019s pastry-making equipment and was frozen in her freezers.\n[5] The pastry chefs had flexible hours. Each would come in about twice a week from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on a typical day. If one chef was not available, Ms. Balatoni would call on the other. They were paid just under $15.00 an hour every two weeks. They were paid on the basis of hours worked.\n[6] Ms. Balatoni had her chefs produce enough strudel to satisfy two different needs. The first was custom orders from clients as they were received by Ms. Balatoni. Those orders would typically take several days to complete because the strudel had to be frozen at least 48 hours before delivery. The second was to have enough of each flavour of strudel in the freezer to fill any last-minute requests.\n[7] To maintain her inventory of frozen strudel, Ms. Balatoni, in consultation with the chefs, would decide how much strudel to produce in each flavour. It was up to the chefs to ensure that enough strudel was in the freezer at all times to fill these last-minute orders. If they needed more ingredients, the chefs would order them.\n[8] Because Ms. Balatoni rarely visited the kitchen, she considered her pastry chefs independent and, therefore, \u201cindependent contractors\u201d. Ms. Balatoni did not have a written contract with either chef.\nThe Previous EI\/CPP Appeals [9] In February of 2023, I heard Ms. Balatoni\u2019s EI\/CPP appeals with respect to the work of her chef, Ms. Csabai, in 2018 and 2019. After hearing from Ms. Balatoni and Ms. Csabai, I concluded that Ms. Csabai was Ms. Balatoni\u2019s employee during that period. Here is how I applied the law to the facts in Ms. Balatoni\u2019s EI\/CPP appeals with respect to the work of Ms. Csabai:\n. . . I conclude that Ms. Csabai was an employee of the appellant rather than an independent contractor in 2018 and 2019. Although Ms. Balatoni never thought of Ms. Csabai as a part-time employee, Ms. Csabai did think of herself as a part\u2011time employee. There was no common intention here, so I dispense with that consideration rather quickly, and go on to review the objective factors, as set out in Wiebe Door.\nMs. Csabai could come and go as she pleased from the appellant's premises as long as she completed her assigned work for the day. The latter element is the key. Ms. Csabai's work was assigned to her by Ms. Balatoni; namely, to produce a certain amount of pastry of certain flavours. How she did that was not up to Ms. Csabai, because all the strudel had to be made in accordance with Ms. Balatoni's old family recipe.\nThe appellant had full control over Ms. Csabai's work at all times, because each strudel made by Ms. Csabai had to be made in accordance with Ms. Balatoni's old family recipe. Ms. Balatoni provided the training to Ms. Csabai, which Ms. Csabai followed precisely. This is why Ms. Balatoni valued her work.\nIn addition, the strudel had to be made on the equipment owned by the appellant in order to satisfy the orders submitted to the appellant by its customers and to restock inventory in accordance with the needs of the appellant so that it would have sufficient inventory on hand to satisfy customer demand.\nMs. Csabai had no capital invested in the business. She did not hire her own helper or helpers, nor did she have an opportunity to profit from the business beyond her hourly wages. She had no risk of loss during the years in issue.\nHaving applied the law to the facts, I conclude that Ms. Csabai was a part-time employee of the appellant during 2018 and 2019. Accordingly, the appeals will be dismissed without costs.[2]\n[10] As I had delivered my reasons for judgment from the bench in the previous EI\/CPP appeals dealing with Ms. Csabai, I provided a copy of the transcript of those reasons to both parties in these appeals several days before the hearing.\nThese EI\/CPP Appeals [11] In 0808498 BC Ltd. v MNR, 2023 TCC 53, Justice Sommerfeldt has succinctly summarized the relevant legal test (footnotes omitted):\n[33] Although there is no universal test for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, the \u201ccentral question is whether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business on his own account.\u201d In making such determination, the following factors should generally be considered:\na) Does the hirer control the worker\u2019s activities?\nb) Does the hirer provide the tools and equipment required by the worker, or is the worker required to provide his or her own tools and equipment?\nc) Does the worker hire his or her own helpers?\nd) What is the degree of financial risk taken by the worker? In other words, does the worker have a risk of loss?\ne) What is the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker?\nf) Does the worker have an opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks?\nThere is no set formula concerning the application of the above factors, which is a non-exhaustive list.\n[12] Based on the evidence in this set of EI\/CPP appeals, I arrive at the following conclusions:\na) Ms. Balatoni controlled Ms. Tarnai\u2019s activities \u2212 Ms. Tarnai was able to make strudel only in accordance with Ms. Balatoni\u2019s recipe.\nb) Ms. Balatoni provided all of the tools and equipment required by Ms. Tarnai \u2013 Ms. Tarnai was not required to provide any of her own tools and equipment.\nc) Ms. Tarnai could not hire her own helpers \u2013 if one chef was unavailable, Ms. Balatoni would call on the other.\nd) Ms. Tarnai had no risk of loss.\ne) Ms. Tarnai had no responsibility for investment and only a modest degree of responsibility for management (i.e., inventory management).\nf) Ms. Tarnai had no opportunity for profit in the performance of her tasks.\n[13] Based on the evidence I heard from Ms. Balatoni and Ms. Tarnai in this set of EI\/CPP appeals, I have arrived at the same findings of fact as I did with respect to the work of Ms. Csabai. There is no material distinction between the work done by either chef for Ms. Balatoni in 2018 and 2019.[3] Applying the law to the facts, Ms. Tarnai was an employee of Ms. Balatoni for purposes of the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Pension Plan.\n[14] The appeals will be dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 9th day of June 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

Ms. Balatoni was attempting to draw a sharp distinction between Ms. Tarnai\u2019s post\u20112019 status as an employee and her pre-2020 status as an independent contractor. This argument has no merit as I am only concerned with Ms. Tarnai\u2019s work in Ms. Balatoni\u2019s kitchen in 2018 and 2019.\n",

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 86\nDate: 20230616\nDocket: 2022-2100(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nJEFFREY P ADAMS,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] In general terms, the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) allows a taxpayer to object to an assessment of tax, interest, or penalty within 90 days of the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) sending the notice of assessment. The Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) will then consider the objection. If the CRA agrees with it, they will issue a reassessment. If they do not agree with it, they will not reassess and will confirm the assessment.\n[2] If a taxpayer does not serve a notice of objection on the Minister within the normal 90-day deadline, they may apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve their notice of objection if they apply for the extension within one year from the end of that 90-day period and if they meet certain other conditions.\n[3] If the Minister decides not to grant the application for an extension of time, the taxpayer may apply to this Court to grant an order extending time to serve their notice of objection. The same timing condition applies, namely, that the taxpayer must have made their application for an extension of time to the Minister within one year from the expiration of the 90-day period to object. That timing condition is at the heart of these applications.\n[4] Mr. Adams, a Toronto lawyer, filed income tax returns (\u201cT1 returns\u201d) for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years without claiming any deduction for legal fees for either year. He later filed T1 adjustment requests seeking deductions of $18,729.85 for 2016 and $21,270.15 for 2017 in computing his income for each of those years for legal fees.\n[5] The CRA reassessed tax for Mr. Adams\u2019 2016 and 2017 taxation years without any deduction for legal fees. As it ultimately decided to reject Mr. Adams\u2019 T1 adjustment requests, it did not reassess for either of those taxation years.\n[6] Mr. Adams seeks an order from this Court under section 166.2 of the Act extending time to object to the reassessments of tax for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years.[1] The Minister sent him a notice of reassessment for each of those years on October 16, 2018, and May 14, 2018, respectively.\n[7] Mr. Adams did not serve notices of objection on the Minister within the normal time set out in paragraph 165(1)(a) of the Act nor did he apply to the Minister for extensions of time to serve notices of objection against the reassessments for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years within the extended one-year deadline provided by paragraph 166.2(5)(a) of the Act:\n166.2(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection \u2026; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice \u2026, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[8] Mr. Adams argued that the Minister is estopped from taking the position that he was late in serving notices of objection to the reassessments of tax for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years. Until April 1, 2022, the CRA led him to believe that it was considering, and then reconsidering, his T1 adjustment requests. On April 1, 2022, the CRA told him that it denied his T1 adjustment requests. It was only then, Mr. Adams argued, that the clock started running to serve notices of objection on the Minister.\n[9] At the hearing, I heard evidence and argument from Mr. Adams. I also received an affidavit from an officer of the CRA, Ms. Shirkhani, upon which she was cross-examined. Here are the relevant dates from that affidavit and from the other evidence:\nMay 7, 2018\nThe CRA sent a notice of assessment for Mr. Adams\u2019 2017 taxation year.[2] It did not reflect any deduction of legal fees.\nMay 10, 2018\nThe CRA sent a notice of assessment for Mr. Adams\u2019 2016 taxation year.[3] It did not reflect any deduction of legal fees.\nMay 14, 2018\nThe CRA sent a notice of reassessment for Mr. Adams\u2019 2017 taxation year.[4] It did not reflect any deduction of legal fees.\nAugust 22, 2018\nMr. Adams\u2019 tax accountant,[5] Mr. Sheldon Rakowsky, signed and filed a two-page form entitled \u201cT1 Adjustment Request\u201d for Mr. Adams\u2019 2016 taxation year.[6]\nMr. Rakowsky made a request to add to line 221 of Mr. Adams\u2019 T1 return for that year carrying charges and interest expenses of $18,729.85 with the following explanation:\nEnclosed please find legal bills from Dansom [sic] Recht LLP paid in order to earn a living. Please include and adjust for same. Thanks [sic] you in advance.\nOctober 16, 2018\nThe CRA sent a notice of reassessment for Mr. Adams\u2019 2016 taxation year.[7] It did not reflect any deduction of legal fees.\nOctober 23, 2018\nThe CRA sent Mr. Adams a letter stating:[8]\nWe have received your request to adjust your 2016 income tax return.\nDue to the complex nature of the change, it will take longer to be processed. The time required to complete a complex adjustment varies with the type of request and the individual circumstances involved.\nWhen your adjustment is complete, we will send you a notice of reassessment. This notice will reflect the changes made to your return.

He denied having received the letter and, during the call, asked the CRA to initiate a \u201creconsideration\u201d of its \u201cdecision\u201d not to accept his T1 adjustment requests. He ended the call under the impression that the CRA would undertake such a \u201creconsideration\u201d.[17]\nDecember 17, 2020\nThe deadline under paragraph 166.1(7)(a) of the Act and the Time Limits and Other Periods Act (COVID-19) for Mr. Adams to apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection in respect of the reassessment of tax for his 2017 taxation year.[18]\nFebruary 17, 2022\nFollowing several requests by Mr. Adams, the CRA sent him a copy of the letter originally dated January 7, 2020. This time, the letter was dated February 17, 2022.[19] Mr. Adams says that this letter offered him only a \u201ccurt summary\u201d of the CRA\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d not to accept his T1 adjustment requests. He contends that the letter failed to include \u201cwritten reasons\u201d that would have allowed him to understand the CRA\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d.[20]\nApril 1, 2022\nThe CRA told Mr. Adams over the phone that \u201cit would not be possible to have the decision reconsidered.\u201d[21]\nApril 20, 2022\nMr. Adams filed an application with the Minister for an extension of time to object to the 2016 and 2017 reassessments.[22]\nJune 8, 2022\nThe Minister sent a letter to Mr. Adams denying his applications for extensions of time to object to the 2016 and 2017 reassessments. The letter states that Mr. Adams submitted his requests on May 3, 2022 but they were due (a) on or before January 14, 2020 for the 2016 taxation year and (b) on or before June 17, 2020 for the 2017 taxation year.[23]\nAugust 14, 2022\nMr. Adams filed his application with the Court for an order extending time to object to the 2016 and 2017 reassessments.[24] In that letter, he made a number of submissions including the following:\nBecause the CRA made a \u201cfactual error\u201d in considering his T1 adjustment requests, the CRA\u2019s \u201cdecision is neither reasonable nor correct.\u201d[25]\n\u201cFrom a procedural point of view, in failing to undertake a reconsideration, the CRA unfairly denied me the benefit of a step in the appeal process.\u201d[26]\nThe CRA led him \u201cto believe that further internal steps were available before a final decision would be made relating to my request for adjustment.\u201d[27]\n\u201cUntil I understood that a final decision had been made, it seemed premature to object.\u201d[28]\nAs soon as he understood that the CRA had not initiated a \u201creconsideration\u201d of its \u201cdecision\u201d not to accept his T1 adjustment requests, he objected as soon as possible on April 20, 2022.[29]\nMr. Adams\u2019 Position\n[10] Mr. Adams argued that the CRA\u2019s conduct led him to believe that there was no need to object to his 2016 and 2017 reassessments while it was considering and reconsidering his T1 adjustment requests.\n[11] Mr. Adams asks me to read paragraph 165(1)(a) of the Act so that the time to serve notices of objection on the Minister in respect of his 2016 and 2017 reassessments began running on April 1, 2022 \u2212 the date on which the CRA notified him that its \u201cdecision was final, and no reconsideration would be made.\u201d[30]\n[12] The logical consequence of Mr. Adams\u2019 argument is that no application for extension of time to serve a notice of objection was necessary because he served his notices of objection on April 20, 2022, well within the normal deadline provided by paragraph 165(1)(a) of the Act.\n[13] In support of his position, Mr. Adams relied on the decision of this Court in Seater v The Queen[31] and, in particular, on the following observation by Judge McArthur:\nGenerally, it is preferable to have a taxpayer\u2019s issues decided on their merits than having them dismissed for having missed time limits in the Act. The courts must attempt to make a fair and just decision in view of all of the facts.[32]\n[14] I agree with Judge McArthur\u2019s general observation, but timing was not at issue in that case. Mr. Adams also relied on the decision of this Court in Mehta v The Queen[33] where Justice V. Miller concluded that it would be \u201cjust and equitable\u201d to grant an application for an extension of time to institute appeals. Once again, timing was not at issue in that case.[34]\n[15] Finally, Mr. Adams relied on the decision of Judge Brul\u00e9 of this Court in Antoniou v MNR.[35] As the Federal Court of Appeal overruled Judge Brul\u00e9\u2019s decision in the course of deciding Canada (Attorney General) v Bowen,[36] Antoniou is no longer good law.\nThe Crown\u2019s Position\n[16] The Crown argued that the Court is required to follow the clear words of the Act set out, in relevant part, in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to these reasons.\n[17] According to the Crown, this is a simple case. Mr. Adams missed the normal deadline to serve notices of objection on the Minister. He then missed the extended one-year deadline to apply for an extension of time. He applied to the Minister on April 20, 2022 but his application was due on January 14, 2020 in respect of the reassessment for his 2016 taxation year and on December 17, 2020 in respect of the reassessment for his 2017 taxation year. That should be the end of the matter.\n[18] Crown counsel relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Armstrong v Canada[37] for the proposition that the Minister\u2019s decision not to reassess for a particular taxation year is discretionary and not subject to review by this Court. I agree. There is no requirement that the Minister reassess to give effect to an amended T1 return or a T1 adjustment request.\n[19] Crown counsel also relied on the decision of the Federal Court in Abakhan & Associates Inc. v Canada[38] for the proposition that this Court cannot order the Minister to reassess to give effect to Mr. Adams\u2019 T1 adjustment requests. I agree with that proposition as well, but that is not what Mr. Adams has asked this Court to do.\nAnalysis\n[20] In Waldron v The Queen,[39] this Court considered the two-year deadline in the Excise Tax Act for filing a new housing rebate application where an officer of Revenue Canada (predecessor of the CRA) had made a representation about the filing deadline that was not entirely accurate. The applicant missed the filing deadline because she relied on that representation.\n[21] Based on the reasoning of Judge Bowman, as he then was, in Goldstein v The Queen,[40] Judge Sarchuk held that the deadline set out in the Excise Tax Act applied notwithstanding Revenue Canada\u2019s inaccurate representation of law and the applicant\u2019s reliance on it:\n[5] The Appellant's position is that the Minister is estopped from changing his position and is bound by the representation of fact made by one of Revenue Canada's employees. That representation is described in paragraph 16 of the agreed facts as follows:\n16. ... that Linda Saunderson made the representation to the Appellants on 2 separate occasions that the time limit for filing the application for the rebate was 2 years from the date of substantial completion and at no time did she advise the Appellants that the deadline was the earlier of 2 years from the date of substantial completion or the date of occupancy of the home. (Emphasis added)\n\u2026\n[7] The issue of estoppel has been considered in a number of cases and the principle which generally can be taken therefrom is that no representation involving an interpretation of law by a servant or officer of the Crown can bind it. The rationale for that position was admirably set out by Bowman T.C.C.J. in Goldstein v. The Queen [96 DTC 1029 at 1034]:\nIt is sometimes said that estoppel does not lie against the Crown. The statement is not accurate and seems to stem from a misapplication of the term estoppel. The principle of estoppel binds the Crown, as do other principles of law. Estoppel in pais, as it applies to Crown, involves representations of fact made by officials of the Crown and relied and acted on by the subject to his or her detriment. The doctrine has no application where a particular interpretation of a statute has been communicated to a subject by an official of the government, relied upon by that subject to his or her detriment and then withdrawn or changed by the government. In such a case a taxpayer sometimes seeks to invoke the doctrine of estoppel. It is inappropriate to do so not because such representations give rise to an estoppel that does not bind the Crown, but rather, because no estoppel can arise where such representations are not in accordance with the law. Although estoppel is now a principle of substantive law it had its origins in the law of evidence and as such relates to representations of fact. It has no role to play where questions of interpretation of the law are involved, because estoppels cannot override the law.\n[8] From the foregoing, it is evident that estoppel may apply if an officer of the Crown made a representation of fact which was relied and acted upon by this Appellant to her detriment [See The Queen v. Langille, 77 DTC 5086]. The question in this appeal is whether the information given by Ms. Saunderson to the Appellant's husband was a representation of fact or of law.\n[9] The representation made by the Crown officer, Linda Saunderson, was with respect to the provisions of subsection 256(3) of the Act, as it then read, which was not entirely accurate but which was relied on by the Appellant to her detriment. More specifically, the representation reflects her failure to stipulate that the statutory provision required an applicant for the rebate to file her application within two years of the day the residence was first occupied or ownership was transferred as described in subparagraph 2(d)(ii) of the Act. This, in my view, falls into the category of interpretation of law and thus estoppel does not arise.\n[Emphasis added]\n[22] Equally on point is the decision of this Court in Casey v The Queen.[41] In that case, Judge Hamlyn dealt with an application under the Act for an extension of time to institute an appeal to this Court.[42] In that case, the countdown to file a notice of appeal began when Revenue Canada sent a notice of confirmation to the applicant in response to their notice of objection. In Casey, the applicant had not agreed to any confirmation of the assessment and, more importantly, understood that Revenue Canada was still considering their objection. Revenue Canada had led the applicant to believe that its administrative machinery was still in motion and, therefore, it would not be necessary to file a notice of appeal.\n[23] Relying once again on Judge Bowman\u2019s reasoning in Goldstein, this Court rejected the applicant\u2019s estoppel argument:\n[19] The Applicant's submission that estoppel in pais is applicable to the Applicant's case is ill founded. According to Martland J. at pages 939-940 in Can. Superior Oil Ltd. v. Paddon-Hughes Development Co. Ltd., [1970] S.C.R. 932, three factors must be present in order to apply the principal of estoppel: there must be a representation or conduct which amounts to a representation which is intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to whom the representation was made, the person to whom the representation was made must act or make an omission as a result of that representation and, finally, the act or omission must be to the detriment of the person. The Applicant has not adduced evidence to show that these requirements have been met.\n[20] Even if these requirements had been met, the doctrine of estoppel is only applicable to representations of fact not to representations of law [See Goldstein v. The Queen, 96 DTC 1029 (T.C.C.)].\n[21] Any representations by Revenue Canada officials to the effect that a Notice of Appeal did not have to be filed within the time period outlined in section 169 were representations of law to which the doctrine of estoppel does not apply.\n[Emphasis added]\n[24] I find that by its letter of October 23, 2018, and by its subsequent telephone communications with Mr. Adams, the CRA led him to believe that there was no need to object to his 2016 and 2017 reassessments as it was still considering, or reconsidering, his T1 adjustment requests. I conclude that in so doing, the CRA made inaccurate representations of law.[43]\n[25] Unfortunately for Mr. Adams, Goldstein, Waldron, and Casey all teach the same lesson \u2212 statutory deadlines must be applied notwithstanding inaccurate representations of law by the CRA, even when the individual has relied on them to their detriment.\n[26] Before concluding, I should deal briefly with Mr. Adams\u2019 argument regarding statutory interpretation. Mr. Adams argued that the objection clock began to run on April 1, 2022 \u2212 the date on which the CRA told him that it made its final decision to deny his T1 adjustment requests. The problem with this argument is that it finds no support in the words of the Act. Mr. Adams asks the Court to add a provision to the Act allowing the normal deadline to begin when the CRA notified the taxpayer that their T1 adjustment request was denied. Only Parliament can amend the Act. This Court cannot do so.\nConclusion\n[27] Mr. Adams missed the extended one-year deadline to apply for an extension of time to serve notices of objection on the Minister. His applications for extensions of time were due January 14, 2020 and December 17, 2020, respectively. He filed them with the Minister on April 20, 2022.\n[28] I have no choice but to dismiss Mr. Adams\u2019 applications for extensions of time under section 166.2 of the Act to serve objections on the Minister of National Revenue against the reassessments of tax for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years. I will do so without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 16th day of June 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

GESSNER,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nRussell J.\nI. Introduction: [1] The appellant, Gregory A. Gessner, appeals the April 30, 2019 reassessment of his 2013 taxation year raised by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) under the federal Income Tax Act (Act). He disagrees with the reassessment\u2019s addition of $36,000 to his 2013 taxable income. He asserts that this amount is exempt from income inclusion per subsection 6(6) for relating to his work at \u201cspecial work sites\u201d.\nII. Overview: [2] In 2013 the appellant, residing with his family in Saskatoon, accepted employment as marketing manager with Suretuf Containment Ltd. (Suretuf), a company engaged in development and production of oil and gas industry products. His brother Clayton owned Suretuf and was its president. The Suretuf office\/plant premises were located in the County of Vermilion River, Alberta, about 30 kilometres from Lloydminster, Alberta. Lloydminster is a small city about a three-hour drive from Saskatoon. Suretuf\u2019s mailing address was a Lloydminster post office box.\n[3] Assumptions of the Minister pleaded in the respondent\u2019s Reply (para. 7) include that Suretuf paid the $36,000 to the appellant in 2013, in respect of weekly living expenses comprised of three amounts - transportation ($9,000), lodging ($9,000) and board ($18,000). Additionally he was reimbursed $7,502 for meals, fuel and vehicle repairs and maintenance.\n[4] At the hearing of this matter the appellant maintained a different \u201cspecial work site\u201d argument than reflected in the pleadings, being that he visited the premises of many customers and potential customers in the course of his work and these numerous locations that he visited constituted individual \u201cspecial work sites\u201d.\n[5] As well, there is the matter that the appealed reassessment is prima facie statute-barred, insofar as it was not raised within the applicable normal reassessment period of three years from date of initial assessment. The appellant did not raise this issue, but it was referenced in the respondent\u2019s Reply.\nIII. Issues: [6] There are two issues. One is whether subsection 6(6) exempts from tax the appellant\u2019s $36,000 payment from his employer, Suretuf. The second is whether subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) applies to render the appealed reassessment procedurally valid despite that it was not raised within three years of the date the Minister initially assessed the appellant\u2019s 2013 year.\nIV. Pertinent Legislation: [7] Subsection 6(6):\n6(6): Employment at special work site or remote location - Notwithstanding subsection (1), in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year from an office or employment, there shall not be included any amount received or enjoyed by the taxpayer in respect of, in the course or by virtue of the office or employment that is the value of, or an allowance (not in excess of a reasonable amount) in respect of expenses the taxpayer has incurred for,\n(a) the taxpayer\u2019s board and lodging for a period at\n(i) a special work site, being a location at which the duties performed by the taxpayer were of a temporary nature, if the taxpayer maintained at another location a self-contained domestic establishment as the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of residence\n(A) that was, throughout the period, available for the taxpayer\u2019s occupancy and not rented by the taxpayer to any other person, and\n(B) to which, by reason of distance, the taxpayer could not reasonably be expected to have returned daily from the special work site, or\n(ii) a location at which, by virtue of its remoteness from any established community, the taxpayer could not reasonably be expected to establish and maintain a self-contained domestic establishment,\nif the period during which the taxpayer was required by the taxpayer\u2019s duties to be away from the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of residence, or to be at the special work site or location, was not less than 36 hours; or\n(b) transportation between\n(i) the principal place of residence and the special work site referred to in subparagraph (a)(i), or\n(ii) the location referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) and a location in Canada or a location in the country in which the taxpayer is employed,\nin respect of a period described in paragraph (a) during which the taxpayer received board and lodging, or a reasonable allowance in respect of board and lodging, from the taxpayer\u2019s employer.\nSubparagraph 152(4)(a)(i):\n152(4)(a)(i): Assessment and reassessment [limitation period] - The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest, or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act\u2026\nV. Does subsection 6(6) apply, to render the appellant\u2019s $36,000 payment from Suretuf exempt from tax? [8] For subsection 6(6) to apply in this matter, relating to \u201cspecial work site(s)\u201d as framed by the appellant, the $36,000 payment must be a \u201creasonable\u201d amount, must have been paid for board, lodging and\/or transportation in respect of work by the appellant at a special work site or sites each for periods of at least 36 hours including time to travel there from the taxpayer\u2019s Saskatoon home and return. As subsection 6(6) provides, a special work site is a location where the duties performed by the taxpayer were of a temporary nature.\n[9] The appealed reassessment reflects the Minister\u2019s conclusion that the location of the Suretuf office\/plant is not a special work site, which is how this matter was initially framed by virtue of the CRA form TD4 referenced below, signed by the appellant.\n[10] The appellant was the sole witness. He testified that he worked for Suretuf from 2 January 2013 until into 2016 \u2013 a more than three year period. His departure at the end of that period was on his initiative. He had accepted another employment position, based in his home city of Saskatoon.\n[11] The evidence established that Suretuf manufactures secondary containment systems for the oil and gas sector. As stated, the appellant was hired as marketing manager of Suretuf\u2019s oil and gas industry products. On January 2, 2013, he signed a completed CRA form TD4 entitled \u201cDeclaration of exemption \u2013 employment at a special work site\u201d (Ex. R-1). This document was produced by the respondent. The appellant\u2019s brother who owned Suretuf had filled out the form, but it had not been signed on behalf of Suretuf. The appellant\u2019s brother was not called as a witness.\n[12] This form addresses aspects of the $36,000 exemption from income in the context of representing the Suretuf office\/plant as being a \u201cspecial work site\u201d. The appellant reviewed the form before signing it. He said the form as completed and as signed by him reflected \u201cagreement in principle\u201d between the two brothers. At the hearing the appellant seemed reluctant to express full agreement with the details in this document that he had signed over ten years ago during the relevant taxation year.\n[13] This completed TD4 form identified the \u201cexact location\u201d of the \u201cspecial work site\u201d as being \u201cLSD 5.5 NE4-48-LW4\u201d, in the County of Vermilion River, Alberta. This location is understood to be where the Suretuf office\/plant premises is located. As well, the form specifies the one-year period of January 2, 2013 to December 31, 2013 as the \u201cperiod of work at the special work site requiring the employee to be away from his or her principal place of residence for at least 36 hours\u201d.\n[14] Also, the form specifies the \u201cbenefits or allowances\u201d the appellant was to receive in relation to work at the special work site - being $18,000 for board, $9,000 for lodging and $9,000 for transportation, totalling $36,000.\n[15] The \u201cemployer\u2019s certification\u201d (that Suretuf did not sign) on this CRA form TD4 reads:\n- the duties the employee has to perform at the special work site are temporary and, by reason of distance, the employee is not expected to return daily to his or her principal place of residence.\n- the board and lodging provided or the allowance received by the employee have been for a period of at least 36 hours spent at the special work site (including the time the employee spends traveling between the principal place of residence and the special work site).\n- the benefits or allowances for transportation given to the employee relate only to the period the employee also receives the value of, or allowances for, board and lodging.\n[16] As well there was entered in evidence an unsigned letter from Suretuf to the appellant dated March 11, 2013, although again unsigned (part of Ex. R-1) on Suretuf\u2019s part. It welcomes him as marketing manager for Suretuf, \u201cbased out of our Lloydminster Office\u201d, effective January 1, 2013. The appellant signed this document on March 11, 2013.\n[17] It sets out \u201cdetails of the new position\u201d, including that the appellant\u2019s \u201crate of base pay\u201d was C$84,000 per year.\n[18] Other \u201cdetails\u201d include:\n- he had a, \u201c[r]emote work location provision to commute weekly from Saskatoon to Lloydminster, Alberta to cover weekly living expenses: C$36,000 per year.\u201d\n- \u201cExpenses: the Company will reimburse you for reasonable travel, expenses incurred in the process of carrying out your duties. Expenses are to be submitted on a regular basis.\u201d\n- \u201cTravel: Extensive travel through your [western Canada] Region with some overnight stay is required.\u201d\n[19] The appellant testified that he did not always travel directly from Saskatoon to Suretuf\u2019s office or back. He often might travel from his family home in Saskatoon at the beginning of a week directly to the location of a customer or potential customer that he planned to visit.\n[20] He agreed that Suretuf reimbursed him for his travel related expenses. There was no evidence that any claimed expenses had gone unpaid. In 2013, Suretuf paid the appellant expense reimbursements totaling $7,502 for meals, fuel and vehicle repairs and maintenance costs. This is apart from the subject $36,000.\n[21] Apparently, the appellant when working out of Suretuf\u2019s premises would lodge with his brother at the latter\u2019s residence in or about Lloydminster, without any charge or payment for same. However, the appellant testified that he paid for many of their shared evening meals. It is to be recalled that $9,000 of the subject $36,000 was for lodging while working at the Suretuf office\/plant premises, presumed to be a \u201cspecial workplace site\u201d.\n[22] Given the above evidence, he question is whether there is a \u201cspecial work site\u201d situation in respect of Suretuf\u2019s work premises in County of Vermilion River, where the appellant was to base his work as marketing manager? As noted, the premises included an office and a plant, 30 kilometres or so from the small city of Lloydminster, Alberta. Being reasonably close to Lloydminster, Suretuf\u2019s premises did not constitute a remote location within the meaning of subparagraph 6(6)(a)(ii), above. In any event there were no submissions from the appellant in this matter that this was a remote location (although the word \u201cremote\u201d does appear once in the completed TD4 form, see above).\n[23] As for being a \u201cspecial work site\u201d, I concur with colleague Justice Jorre who stated in Bourget v. Her Majesty, 2009 TCC 533 (para. 18), that a \u201cspecial work site\u201d is not the equivalent of \u201cany place of work\u201d. Also in that decision I note and concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion (para. 21) that:\nRegardless of the scope of the meaning of the words \u201cspecial work site\u201d, it does not include the appellant\u2019s employer\u2019s headquarters\u2026\n[24] My understanding that Suretuf\u2019s \u201coffice\/plant\u201d premises in County of Vermilion River de facto constituted Suretuf\u2019s headquarters. I heard no reference to any other Suretuf location.\n[25] In any event, subparagraph 6(6)(a)(i) describes a \u201cspecial work site\u201d as \u201cbeing a location at which the duties performed by the taxpayer were of a temporary nature\u201d. Thus, were the appellant\u2019s duties as marketing manager, \u201cof a temporary nature\u201d?\n[26] While the TD4 form signed by the appellant identified the \u201cwork period\u201d as being one year, in fact he continued with this job for over three years, before leaving on his own motion, as above noted. More than three years of work before leaving on his own terms is not at all suggestive that his marketing management duties undertaken in early 2013 were at all temporary in nature.\n[27] To the contrary, the position of marketing manager with commensurate duties would seem to be a key permanent position, all the more so for a company such as Suretuf producing products for sale to oil and gas industry customers across western Canada and somewhat beyond. That is, the duties of a marketing manager would not be expected to be completed after any finite period, but rather to continue indefinitely.\n[28] As part of the respondent\u2019s Ex. R-1 exhibit, there is on Suretuf letterhead a bullet list of \u201cGeneral Duties\u201d, pertaining to the appellant as marketing manager. They include:\n- \u201cProduct development. This includes travelling by car or plane to all customer sites and locations to gain insight and first-hand knowledge of design changes to existing wall.\u201d\n- \u201cFormulate and establish market action plans, budgets, goals, quotas for operations.\u201d\n- \u201cParticipate in development of market strategies and long-range planning.\u201d\n- \u201cMaintain frequent contact with the Operations Manager, plant and sales staff.\u201d\n- \u201cAppraise promptness of order processing, deliveries, technical services and parts, warranty and other customer services. Recommend changes.\u201d\n- \u201cAttend meetings and training at the office\/plant as required.\u201d\n- \u201cProvide technical, product, and application solutions to customers throughout the assigned territory.\u201d\n- \u201cPrepare and perform product assessments as required. This may be in the field or in the office.\u201d\n- \u201cContinually appraise company products, policies and procedures as opposed to competitor\u2019s line relative to design, pricing, marketability, etc. Recommend changes as required. Recommend pricing and market strategy.\u201d\n[29] These duties cannot reasonably be said to have been \u201cof a temporary nature\u201d. These are duties of a continuing nature, fundamental to the core job of managing the marketing of products that a business has produced.\n[30] In contrast, an example of a temporary duty would be the execution and completion of a defined project (e.g., a construction project) at a particular site. When the project is done it is done. The project\u2019s end is contemplated from its very beginning.\n[31] Accordingly, I conclude that the Suretuf premises did not constitute for the appellant a \u201cspecial work site\u201d, so as to trigger subsection 6(6) and thereby allow the subject $36,000 payment to be tax-free.\n[32] As noted, at the hearing the appellant departed from the argument that I have just addressed (that the Suretuf premises constituted a \u201cspecial work site\u201d), as reflected in the CRA TD4 form that the appellant had signed in early 2013.\n[33] Rather, at the hearing the appellant through his representative submitted in evidence a lengthy listing of Suretuf customers and potential customers and the locations of their various premises (Ex. A-1) that he said he had visited over his time as Suretuf\u2019s marketing manager. The multi\u2011page computer printed list consisted of several hundred contact names for oil and gas businesses in Calgary, Edmonton, Lloydminster, Red Deer, Taber, Lethbridge and other Alberta locations, and including locations in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and North Dakota that he said he had visited.\n[34] His position at the hearing was that each of the individual locations of his asserted customer and potential customer visits constituted a \u201cspecial work site\u201d.\n[35] Were these \u201cspecial work sites\u201d? If so, any salesperson could claim likewise. No supportive records as to such visits, confirming the manner of such visits (in person, by phone or internet) were produced. Nor was any mileage log produced. Perhaps some of these actual visits are the basis for the $7,502 total of expense reimbursement that the appellant received in the one year in issue - 2013. We don\u2019t know. The listing is much too lengthy to contemplate that all such locations could have been visited in the relevant 2013 taxation year.\n[36] The appellant said several times that the Act did not require him to save receipts \u2013 presumably he was expressing his understanding of subsection 6(6). But of course the subsection requires that the expenses it covers have to be \u201creasonable\u201d. That cannot be gauged without receipts. The further question is, how could he be justified in seeking the subject $36,000 as an expense allowance in addition to the $7,502 remuneration?\n[37] And as well, what temporary aspect is there of duties relating to conducting the marketing process in relation to any particular customer? In each instance marketing duties are contemplated as continuing rather than being temporary in nature. The appellant\u2019s duties were to establish and maintain long-term business relationships. These are not temporary duties. This work would be expected to be ongoing and continuous in nature. Thus, these locales could not be \u201cspecial work sites\u201d as the duties associated therewith were not in any respect temporary in nature as contemplated by subsection 6(6).\n[38] Thus, I conclude that the locales of the individual customers that the appellant purportedly visited (which visits were not at all supported by the submission of travel records of any nature),did not themselves constitute \u201cspecial work sites\u201d so as to justify application of subsection 6(6), so as to render any of the subject $36,000 as being non-taxable.\nVI. Is the reassessment statute-barred? [39] Lastly, I address the issue of whether the prima facie statute\u2011barred appealed reassessment is actually statute-barred and thus procedurally invalid.\n[40] The respondent pleads in its Reply at paras. 8 and 12 that the appellant made misrepresentations in his 2013 return attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default, thereby entitling the Minister per subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) to raise the appealed reassessment on April 30, 2019, being well after the May 5, 2017 expiry of the applicable normal reassessment period.\n[41] The respondent pleads that the misrepresentation was the appellant\u2019s omitting inclusion of the $36,000 in his 2013 taxation year return. I first have had to deal with whether this omission was incorrect (thereby being a misrepresentation). Per above I have concluded that the $36,000 should have been reported as claimed \u201cspecial work sites\u201d did not exist. Thus the non-reporting was a misrepresentation.\n[42] The remaining question per subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) is whether that misrepresentation was the result of \u201cnegligence, carelessness or wilful default\u201d. If so then the appealed reassessment is not statute-barred.\n[43] Although the appellant did not raise this issue, rightly it was pleaded in the respondent\u2019s Reply. In Vincent DiCosmo v. Her Majesty, 2017 FCA 60, para. 9, the Federal Court of Appeal observed:\n9. In our view, the jurisprudence of this Court requires that the issue of whether an assessment is statute-barred must be specifically pleaded. The underlying rationale is to ensure fairness and to permit all evidence relevant to be before the Court.\n[44] Here the misrepresentation alleged by the respondent (Reply, para. 8) is that reported income was understated by $36,000. The appellant\u2019s salary income from employment was $84,000, and the Minister considers that the assessed amount of $36,000 from his employer should also have been reported, that latter amount representing approximately 34% of the $120,000 total of these two figures.\n[45] In Venne v. R., a venerable Federal Court Trial Division decision from 1984, Strayer J. as he then was viewed the subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) circumstances of, \u201cneglect, carelessness or wilful default\u201d as equivalent to a taxpayer failing to exercise reasonable care.[1] Further, per Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd. v. R., exercising reasonable care requires a taxpayer to act as a \u201cwise and prudent person\u201d.[2]\n[46] Additionally, in 1989, the FCTD observed in 1056 Enterprises Ltd. v. R. that:\nSubsection 152(4) protects such conduct, and perhaps only such conduct, where the taxpayer thoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assesses the situation as being one in which the law does not exact the reporting of that which the taxpayer bona fide believes does not exist.[3] (underlining added)\n[47] This language was approved by the Federal Court of Appeal in Regina Shoppers Mall.[4]\n[48] The respondent submits that the appellant failed to exercise reasonable care in concluding that this $36,000 was paid in relation to his working at \u201cspecial work site(s0\u201d as provided in subsection 6(6), in addition to his work expenses having been reimbursed by his employer.\n[49] In my view, the appellant did not exercise the required reasonable care. He did not, \u201cthoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assess the situation\u201d in choosing not to report this significant amount of $36,000 as income despite that already he had been reimbursed the not inconsiderable sum of $7,502 for actual work travel related expenses. There was no clarification as to whether this latter amount applied to expenses the $36,000 was to reimburse.\n[50] Nor, it appears to me, did he thoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assess whether his marketing management work duties were of a temporary nature (a necessary characteristic of \u201cspecial work sites\u201d). This is so whether in respect of the Suretuf office\/plant premises or the various locations in Alberta and elsewhere where the appellant sought to market Suretuf\u2019s products in 2013 - 2016 (absent evidentiary records confirming such travel to such locations).\n[51] The appellant\u2019s assertion that he always intended to leave the position shortly (although he did not, staying for over three years) does not at all establish any temporary nature of the marketing work duties themselves. This should have been clear to him in \u201cthoughtfully, deliberately and carefully\u201d assessing his position.\n[52] Also noted was that $9,000 of the $36,000 apparently was intended for his lodging expenses in the Suretuf office\/plant area, yet he stayed with his brother in that area for no charge. Knowing this is a further reason as to why the appellant could not reasonably have concluded that he need not report the $36,000 or any part of it.\n[53] Thus, I find that subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) applies to render the appealed reassessment as not being statute-barred. The appellant omitted to report the $36,000 in his 2013 return through neglect, carelessness or wilful default. That is, he did not take reasonable care in deciding to omit the reporting of the $36,000 payment in his 2013 return.\nVII. Conclusion: [54] Accordingly, the appealed reassessment is valid, both substantively (subsection 6(6) does not apply to permit non-reporting of the $36,000); and procedurally (the omission to report was decided through neglect, carelessness or wilful default, thus rendering the reassessment not statute-barred).\n[55] Thus, this appeal will be dismissed.

Introduction\n[1] The Minister assessed the Appellant, Alexandre Papouchine (\u201cMr. Papouchine\u201d), for his 2009 taxation year on January 11, 2016 (the \u201cassessment\u201d). Mr. Papouchine had not filed a return before that date. As such, the Minister relied on Section 152(7) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). On April 11, 2016, Mr. Papouchine filed a notice of objection. On May 24, 2017, the Minister confirmed the assessment.\n[2] Subsequently, on April 25, 2017, Mr. Papouchine filed a 2009 tax return (the \u201clate tax return\u201d). The disparity between the Minister\u2019s 152(7) return from Mr. Papouchine\u2019s own version is illustrated below, save for late filing penalties which the Minister had previously assessed:\n2009 Taxation Year\nLine Item from return\nMinister\n(Jan 11, 2016)\nMr. Papouchine\n(April 24, 2017)\nIncome\n$69,600.00\n(Employment)\n$69,600.00\n(Business)\nBusiness Expenses\n$0.00\n($63,803.00)\nIncome: Employment Ins.\n$805.00\n$805.00\nInterest Income\n$436.00\n$436.00\nSocial Benefit Repayment\n($241.00)\n$0.00\nTotal Income\n$70,600.00\n$7,037.00\nII. Further Facts\nPreliminary issues [3] On a preliminary issue, Mr. Papouchine requested an adjournment the week prior to the hearing and, then again, at the outset of the hearing itself. He did so on the basis that he suffered from chronic mental stress.\n[4] He further stated that he had not been assigned a Workers\u2019 Safety Insurance Board (\u201cWSIB\u201d) doctor because there was an inordinate delay. His chronic stress condition prevented him from concentrating, reading complex materials and speaking in an organized fashion. He had no third party medical evidence to offer to support his condition. Like the week before, the Court denied the request and proceeded to hear the appeal. Throughout, and notwithstanding his protestations to the contrary, Mr. Papouchine followed along, testified in a forthright manner and marshalled his closing arguments, even without accepting the Court\u2019s suggested break. Further, to ensure Mr. Papouchine\u2019s asserted condition does not interfere with his paced review of these reasons, the Court rejected its usual custom in such appeals to render reasons orally, and renders these reasons for judgment in writing.\nThe Minister and Mr. Papouchine disagree on income and expenses [5] Through testimony-in-chief and cross-examination, both the assessment and the subsequent late tax return were reviewed in some detail.\n[6] For the Minister\u2019s subsection 152(7) assessment, the two T4s from Universal Support Systems Ltd. and Emex Systems Inc., respectively, informed Mr. Papouchine\u2019s source of income for 2009. The two T4 amounts yielded the final employment source of income of $70,600.00. As noted, no deductions were allowed.\n[7] In contrast, the late tax return (placed into evidence by the Respondent on cross-examination) categorized the income source as business and offered the following amounts as business income and expenses:\nBusiness Income\n(AP Technologies)\n$69,600.00\nMotor Vehicle Expenses\n(100% Business Use)\nFuel & Oil $4,550.00\nInsurance $9,798.00\nLeasing $28, 256.00\nParking $2,300.00__\nTotal : $44,904.00_\n($44, 904.00)\nSub-contracting\n($12,000.00)\nInterest\n($6,000.00)\nNet Income\n$5,796.00\nMr. Papouchine\u2019s description of his business and expenses [8] Mr. Papouchine claimed his sole proprietorship, AP Technologies, was an independent contractor providing services to Universal and Emex. He also asserted that the work placements with these two companies were via an \u201cemployment agency\u201d.\n[9] On the expense side, Mr. Papouchine acknowledged that certain motor vehicle expenses, insurance and some other expenses accrued in previous years. He simply carried them forward to a year when he had income against which he might deduct such expenses. Further, there were subcontractors paid for whom he was not afforded deductions.\nAbsence of receipts, books and documents no impediment [10] Mr. Papouchine had no books, records, receipts, agreements or other documentary evidence to offer the Court. Mr. Papouchine argued this should not cause concern: the business source of income and deductions were claimed in good faith, are reasonable and reflect a business relationship. Further, Mr. Papouchine had no opportunity to prepare documents concerning his 2009 tax return because of his health issue.\n[11] Mr. Papouchine also suggested that the Minister\u2019s agents at the CRA had inappropriately discounted his late tax return contrary to their legal obligation to accept it as accurate and reliable.\nIII. Analysis and Decision\n[12] Based upon these facts, the Court concludes the following and renders its decision below.\n[13] Mr. Papouchine failed to file his 2009 tax return when he was lawfully required to do so: the end of April 2010, pursuant to paragraph 150(1)(d) of the Act.\n[14] When he did not file his tax return, the Minister was permitted to assessed a penalty for his failure to file by the due date: every person who fails to file \u201cas and when required\u201d, under subsection (150)(1), may be assessed a penalty pursuant to subsection 162(1) of the Act.\n[15] As a result of not filing for 2009, the Minister exercised her right to assess Mr. Papouchine, pursuant to subsection 152(7) of the Act on January 11, 2016. By the same subsection, the Minister was not bound by the subsequent late tax return, itself filed 7 years after it was legally due. Even if the late tax return had been filed on time, the Minister was not bound by it by virtue of the same subsection.\n[16] Mr. Papouchine is entitled to have this Court consider whether the Minister\u2019s assessment for tax under subsection 152(7) is correct. The conduct of the Minister\u2019s agents, as was alleged in the notice of appeal, has of no bearing on the correctness of assessment, save for errors made in the assessment per se.\n[17] The Minister\u2019s assessment was based upon certain assumptions contained in the reply to the notice of appeal. Two assumptions were key to the 2009 assessment: 12(a); Mr. Papouchine was an employee of Emex and Universal; he earned employment income of $169,900.\n[18] These assumptions, as a matter of law, are reviewed by the Court as a fact unless the taxpayer presents a prima facie case proving otherwise, whereupon the Minister is looked to for facts and evidence which \u201crebut\u201d the prima facie case: Hickman Motors Ltd. v. HMQ 97 DTC 5363 (SCC). Contrary to Mr. Papouchine\u2019s view, there is no presumption that his return \u201cfiled in good faith\u201d should be unquestionably accepted, regardless of any supporting documentation being produced,\n[19] The Minister\u2019s assumptions were before the Court. Mr. Papouchine offered no evidence on any basis concerning his claimed business source of income or claimed business expenses.\n[20] There simply is no documentary or reliable evidence to challenge the assumptions. Aside from Mr. Papouchine\u2019s oral testimony of the existence of a business, subcontractors, an intermediate agent and the incurrence of the expenses, there is no supporting evidence whatsoever. There are no contracts between Universal or Emex and the placement agency or between such agency and Mr. Papouchine or AP Technologies. In such absence of documents or third-party testimony, the Court cannot discard the relevant assumptions of the Minister. Further, the T4s are issued directly to Mr. Papouchine; there is no invoice to an agency and payment record to Mr. Papouchine or his proprietorship from any intermediate agency.\n[21] On the issue of the expenses, even if a business source of income were found to exist, there are no invoices for motor vehicles expenses, insurance or parking. Likewise, evidence of the sub-contracts, invoicing and payments to sub-contractors were not produced. The Act requires every person carrying on business to keep relevant business records: subsection 230(1). There were no such records.\n[22] The absence of any records also prevents the Court from considering allowing any deduction of expenses from employment. Further, Mr. Papouchine specifically resisted such characterization of employment expenses. But again, this does not matter, since evidence of such allowable employment expenses does not exist, whether reasonable, incurred during the year, or for employment purposes. None of the above credibly existed before the Court.\n[23] For all these reasons, delivered in writing given the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 20th day of June 2023.\n\u201cR.S.

Introduction\n[1] Sophie Payette (the appellant) is appealing the decision rendered by the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) on May 4, 2018 that she did not hold insurable employment with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec (the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration) during the period from January 1, 2016, to May 17, 2016 (the relevant period).\n[2] Between 1988 and 1999, the appellant held various positions at the Caisse Desjardins in Anjou. She then took an opportunity to work as a trainer with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration for two or three years, after which point she went back to work at a Caisse Desjardins in Montreal. In 2001, following a branch merger, the appellant's position was eliminated. Although the appellant had put in a request for a coordinator position at a branch, she decided to become a mortgage consultant with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration because she found this type of work very interesting. At the beginning of her job search process, the appellant had approached a former colleague at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration who was a mortgage consultant, and this person put her in contact with an executive who explained the working conditions to her. The appellant worked as a mortgage consultant from October 15, 2001, until May 17, 2016, at which point the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration terminated her contract.\n[3] Generally, in her role as mortgage consultant, the appellant approached potential clients to offer them mortgage financing and encourage them to apply for a loan through Caisses Desjardins. She was paid entirely on commission. The appellant sought out prospective clients through real estate brokers, credit unions and contractors, especially in the new build market. She prepared pre-approval files and mortgage loans before they were approved by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[4] In March 2017, after her contract was terminated, the appellant requested a ruling as to her worker status for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act (S.C. 1996, c. 23) (the EIA). The Minister\u2019s decision that the appellant did not hold insurable employment is the matter in dispute in this case.\nII. Preliminary question \u2013 motion\n[5] On January 5, 2021, the appellant submitted a motion for the Court to set aside the Minister\u2019s decision on the grounds that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s appeal under section 91 of the EIA had been served outside the prescribed time limit and was therefore illegal. The Associate Chief Justice decided that this motion would be heard by the trial judge.\n[6] It should be noted that, following the appellant\u2019s request as to the insurability of her employment under section 90 of the EIA, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rendered an initial decision on May 18, 2017, that the appellant's employment with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration was insurable employment. Section 91 of the EIA provides that an appeal from such a ruling may be made by any person concerned within ninety (90) days after the person is notified of the ruling.\n[7] On November 3, 2017, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration wrote to the CRA to indicate that it was appealing the decision rendered on May 18, 2017, and was requesting to be relieved of their failure to appeal the decision within the ninety (90)-day time limit. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration wrote the following:\n[translation] First, we are asking that our client, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, be relieved of the failure to appeal this decision within 90 days of being notified. It was only after the appeal of Sylvain Marceau of the Canada Revenue Agency in mid-October 2017 requesting the regularization of Sophie Payette\u2019s status, that our client became aware of the existence of this correspondence and the lack of follow-up.\nWe would also like to underscore that our client has always intended to challenge this decision, as indicated in its objection filed in an identical case that is currently being reviewed by the Appeals Division.\nIn this context, we respectfully submit to you that our application for leave to appeal should be admissible and our client should be relieved of its failure to challenge the decision within the time limit prescribed by the Act. Otherwise, our client would experience serious and irreparable harm.\n[8] According to the notes of a phone conversation on December 5, 2017, between the CRA and a representative of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, the letter informing the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration of the decision dated May 18, 2017, was apparently misfiled, specifically filed in a file involving a similar appeal. In a letter dated December 7, 2017, the CRA advised the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration that based on their explanations, they had concluded that the appeal had been received within the 90-day time limit following the notification of the decision.\n[9] On May 4, 2018, after the appeal was dealt with, the Minister overturned the decision dated May 18, 2017, concluding that the appellant did not hold insurable employment. The appellant appealed her case before this Court. On October 22, 2019, Mr. Justice Tardif allowed the appeal, thereby overturning the Minister\u2019s decision and concluding that the appellant had held insurable employment (Payette v. M.N.R., 2019 TCC 235). The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration appealed this decision, and on October 26, 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal referred the decision back to this Court for reconsideration by another Court judge (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec v. Canada (National Revenue), 2020 FCA 182).\n[10] After hearing the parties, the Court ruled on the motion. I note that the motion submitted in January 2021 requesting that the Minister\u2019s decision dated May 4, 2018, be overturned came after the many steps mentioned above. According to the appellant, given that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration received the letter informing them of the decision dated May 18, 2017, it received the notification and did not appeal within the prescribed time limit. The appellant maintains that the CRA overstepped its rights in accepting the appeal that was submitted over ninety (90) days after the date of the decision.\n[11] According to the intervener, the appellant should have formally challenged the CRA\u2019s decision that was communicated in their letter dated December 7, 2017, in which they concluded that the appeal had been submitted within the prescribed time limit, and that it is now too late. According to the respondent, the appellant could have applied for judicial review of the decision to accept the notice of appeal from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, in which case the case would have been heard by the Federal Court. After hearing the parties, the Court ruled on the motion.\nProvision of the motion\n[12] It is worth briefly reiterating the context of the motion. The parties agree that the notice of appeal was submitted over ninety (90) days after the letter dated May 18, 2017, informing the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration of the decision reached as to the insurability of the employment in question. Following the explanations provided by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, in a letter dated December 7, 2017, the CRA informed the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration that they were accepting that their notice of appeal had been received within the ninety (90)-day time limit following the notification of the decision. The purpose of the appellant's motion is to ask this Court to overturn this decision.\n[13] The first question is what the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is in deciding the validity of the CRA\u2019s decision to accept the notice of appeal from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration dated November 3, 2017. In my opinion, this decision is a matter of the Minister\u2019s discretion that must be challenged before the Federal Court in the form of a judicial review. It appears that the agent for the appellant attempted to challenge this decision several times, but not in the form of judicial review. Given the applicable rules of procedure, it is too late to apply for judicial review before the Federal Court. I note that since this decision was made by the CRA, a great many things have happened in this case, specifically a hearing on the merits before Tardif J. of this Court, an appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal and a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal referring this case back before this Court to be heard again by another judge. Under these circumstances, the motion was dismissed, and the appeal was heard on the merits.\nIII. Issue\n[14] The issue is whether the appellant held insurable employment with the intervener for the relevant period pursuant to section 5 of the EIA. More specifically, this involves determining whether she performed her work as a mortgage consultant with the intervener under a contract of employment (and consequently as an employee) or under a contract for services (and consequently as an independent contractor).\nIV. Applicable law\n[15] Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA specifies that \u201cinsurable employment\u201d includes \u201cemployment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service\u201d without, however, defining a contract of service. Paragraph 5(1)(a) reads as follows:\n5(1) Subject to subsection (2), insurable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise; [. . .]\n[Emphasis added]\n[16] Since the facts in this case occurred in Quebec, it is essential to rely on applicable private law in Quebec in relation to property and civil rights to interpret the contract between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. In this regard, it is worth reiterating section 8.1 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21), which recognizes the complementarity of Quebec civil law with federal law. The Federal Court of Appeal confirmed this approach in 9041-6868 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 2005 FCA 334 (9041), Grimard v. Canada, 2009 FCA 47 (Grimard) and Ray-Mont Logistics Montr\u00e9al Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2020 FCA 113.\n[17] However, in interpreting the contract between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration to determine whether this is a contract of service, i.e. a contract of employment instead of a contract of enterprise, articles 1425, 1426, 2085, 2086, 2098 and 2099 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, CQLR, c CCQ 1991 (the Civil Code) must be considered (see Appendix A below).\n[18] Article 2085 of the Civil Code provides for the following:\n2085. A contract of employment is a contract by which a person, the employee, undertakes, for a limited time and for remuneration, to do work under the direction or control of another person, the employer.\n[Emphasis added]\n[19] However, according to section 2085 of the Civil Code, the three following constituent elements define a contract of employment (see 9041 at paragraph 11):\ni) the performance of work;\nii) remuneration; and\niii) the direction or control of the employer, meaning a relationship of subordination.\n[20] It is also instructive to consider articles 2098 and 2099 of the Civil Code concerning a contract of enterprise, which provides for the following:\n2098. A contract of enterprise or for services is a contract by which a person, the contractor or the provider of services, as the case may be, undertakes to another person, the client, to carry out physical or intellectual work or to supply a service, for a price which the client binds himself to pay to him.\n2099. The contractor or the provider of services is free to choose the means of performing the contract and, with respect to such performance, no relationship of subordination exists between the contractor or the provider of services and the client.\n[Emphasis added]\n[21] The applicable law cited above demonstrates that the relationship of subordination is the determining factor that distinguishes a contract of employment from a contract of enterprise. In this case, the fact that the appellant performed work for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and that she was remunerated is not being contested. It follows that the determining question is whether the appellant performed her work under the direction and control of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, or in other words, whether there was a relationship of subordination between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[22] In analyzing the contract, the common intention of the parties in light of the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, the interpretation which has been given to it by the parties or which it may have received, and usage, must all be taken into account as required by articles 1425 and 1416 of the Civil Code.\n[23] I note that in Grimard (paragraphs 28 and 43), the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed that there is a difference in conceptualization between common law and civil law in terms of approach but also expressed the view that a court does not err in taking into consideration as indicators of supervision the other criteria used under the common law in determining a relationship of subordination, i.e. control of the work. The Court stated the following:\n43 In short, in my opinion there is no antinomy between the principles of Quebec civil law and the so\u2011called common law criteria used to characterize the legal nature of a work relationship between two parties. In determining legal subordination, that is to say, the control over work that is required under Quebec civil law for a contract of employment to exist, a court does not err in taking into consideration as indicators of supervision the other criteria used under the common law, that is to say, the ownership of the tools, the chance of profit, the risk of loss, and integration into the business.\n[24] I hasten to add that both case law in civil law and case law in common law specify that the legal nature of the overall relationship between the parties must be determined (Grimard at paragraph 67; 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 SCC 59 [Sagaz]). However, there is no one conclusive test which can be universally applied to determine whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor, no particular factor plays a decisive role, and there is no magical formula that can be applied to determine the legal nature of a relationship in a given situation (see Sagaz at paragraph 46). However, in addition to the level of control exercised by the employer, the typically relevant factors to consider include determining whether the worker \u201cprovides his own equipment, hires his helpers, manages and assumes financial risks, and has an opportunity of profit in the performance of his tasks\u201d (1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 85 [Connor Homes], paragraph 41).\nV. Evidence and analysis\n[25] It is important to remember that the parties are not contesting that the appellant performed work and was remunerated. Only the third constituent element defining a contract of employment\u2014the criterion of direction and control, i.e. a relationship of subordination\u2014is in dispute.\nA. Circumstances under which the relationship was developed\n[26] \u00c9ric Trudeau, Regional Director of Mortgage Financing for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, was called a witness by the intervener. He explained that branches, which are all independent of each other, decided to merge to create the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and centralize certain services, such as mortgage financing services. Mr. Trudeau explained that he was responsible for a team of business development advisors (BDAs) who in turn played a support role for mortgage consultants. The mortgage consultants that provide services to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration solicit new opportunities and prepare mortgage financing files. Once the forms have been completed, and pursuant to section 3.2 of the contract, the consultants submit the files for approval to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s financing centre for the borrower to qualify, after which point the loan is sent to a branch that handles the business relationship. In response to the question of why consultants could not authorize the mortgage financing themselves, Mr. Trudeau explained that it was to avoid conflict resulting from allowing consultants to make the decision of whether to provide the financing when their income depends on that decision.\n[27] According to Mr. Trudeau, although there is no set amount of prior experience required to become a mortgage consultant, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration seeks out people with a strong business profile because consultants are responsible for developing their business. He also explained that unlike mortgage brokers, who do not work exclusively for a specific lender and must hold a mortgage brokerage licence, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration's mortgage consultants work exclusively for them and are not required to have this licence.\n[28] As mentioned above, after the position that she held was eliminated at a branch, the appellant had a choice to make about the work that she was going to do moving forward. According to her testimony, she decided to become a mortgage consultant because of the challenge that this represented and because it seemed very interesting to her. The appellant had discussions with Mario Rivest, an executive of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, who explained the working conditions to her. The appellant understood that as a mortgage consultant, she would be paid entirely on commission without any guaranteed minimum income and without benefits. She signed an initial contract with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration in 2001, which she resigned every year until 2016 (Exhibits A-3 and I-4). The appellant explained that the amount of commissions that she earned, which were paid when the mortgage loan was approved, changed over the years: initially she earned under $100,000, but between 2003 and 2007, she earned about $150,000 in commission. The appellant indicated that the commissions that she earned decreased when economic conditions affected the new build market, which at times represented 95% of her clients. The appellant added that her income was also affected when the branches established employee positions that were dedicated to recruiting for mortgage financing since this represented another client base for her.\nB. Parties\u2019 intention and interpretation of the contract\n[29] As mentioned above, in the interpretation of the contract between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, the common intention of the parties must be sought. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration had the subjective intention to enter into a contract of service (contract of enterprise) and not a contract of employment.\n[30] Clause 4.4 of the contract provides that the mortgage consultant must assume all costs, expenses or fees related to the performance of the service contract, while clause 6.1 specifies that no relationship of subordination is being established between the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and the consultant as a result of this agreement. Clause 6.2 also indicates that each party shall pay their own taxes and duties. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration provided T4A slips (Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity and Other Income) to the appellant and did not withhold any deductions from the commissions paid to the appellant.\n[31] In her testimony, the appellant recognized that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s representative had clearly told her that she would be paid entirely on commission, with no minimum guaranteed income and without any benefits. She had previously been an employee and fully understood what she was losing in terms of benefits, since she had previously been entitled to benefits, such as insurance and pension plans. During her discussions with the representative of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, the appellant understood that she would be \u201con contract\u201d and that she could deduct expenses as a self-employed worker. She stated that she filled out her tax returns as a self-employed worker and in calculating her income deducted her expenses, including the costs incurred for a home office, for the use of her vehicle and for advertising. I note that in a letter dated March 16, 2017, addressed to the CRA concerning her request for a ruling as to her worker status, she wrote that she had been [translation] \u201chired by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration as an independent contractor paid on commission\u201d, and she explained her disagreement.\n[32] It is important to note that the appellant was required to sign a new contract every year. In her testimony, she indicated that she had signed it every year without ever asking for a clause to be amended because she felt as though she had no choice, i.e. as though if she did not sign the contract, she would not be able to continue to work as a mortgage consultant. In my opinion, this state of affairs may indicate unequal bargaining power in the business relationship but is not in and of itself an indicator of a relationship of subordination. Every independent contractor who refuses to sign a contract with a work provider may find themself without work provided by this payer; this does not make this person an employee of the payer. I conclude that based on the preponderance of evidence, the common intention of the parties was to enter into a contract of service.\nC. Direction and control by the payer \u2013 relationship of subordination\n[33] Now the overall relationship between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration must be examined to determine whether the objective reality confirms the parties\u2019 subjective intention to enter into a contract of service.\nSchedule, work tools and helpers\n[34] The appellant explained that she did most of her work from her car. She would go to her clients, either to their home or to their work. She confirmed that she was free to organize her own schedule and determine with her clients when she would meet them. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration did not record the hours she worked or manage her schedule in any way. That said, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration had an expectation that consultants would return clients\u2019 calls within twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48) hours.\n[35] The appellant did not have to obtain the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s authorization to attend personal appointments or take vacation. Arnaud Guillaumont, who currently works as a mortgage consultant and was called as a witness by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, confirmed that when he was a BDA, mortgage consultants never requested authorization from him for absences. That said, if the appellant was going to be absent, she needed to make arrangements so that someone else would handle her files. In those cases, she entered into an agreement with another mortgage consultant, and the two agreed on sharing the commission that might result from the work handled.\n[36] The appellant recognized that mortgage consultants had the right to retain the services of an assistant. In fact, the appellant worked with Vanessa Dufresne, the assistant of another mortgage consultant whom she was replacing during her maternity leave. The appellant confirmed that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration did not determine the renumeration of assistants nor did they pay them. It was the appellant who paid Ms. Dufresne and deducted those amounts when calculating her income. France Poirier, an assistant who provided services to various mortgage consultants and was called as a witness by the appellant, simply confirmed the appellant's testimony in this regard. Mr. Guillaumont, who works with an assistant, explained that when mortgage consultants want to retain the services of an assistant, they must contact their BDA so that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration can perform a credit and background check on this person. He stated that he negotiated the rate of pay with his assistant, and that he is the one who pays her. He also confirmed that when he was a BDA, he did not deal with assistants.\n[37] Clause 4.5 of the contract provides that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration agreed to make a standardized smartphone and computer equipment with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s software installed on it available to the appellant. However, according to section 9 and Appendix B of the Business and Operational Processes Guide for Desjardins Mortgage Consultants (Guide, Exhibit A-4), the appellant was responsible for monthly fees set by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration for using the computer and telephone equipment and for connecting to Desjardins\u2019 network services. The appellant confirmed that she was responsible for these fees. Ms. Grandchamp, a mortgage consultant and witnessed called by the appellant, confirmed that she paid phone and computer fees. Mr. Trudeau explained that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration provided the computers for reasons related to software and information security.\nEstablishment of objectives, meetings with BDAs and evaluations\n[38] Several witnesses discussed the role of BDAs and their relationship with mortgage consultants. As mentioned above, BDAs are employees of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration who play a support role for consultants. During questioning, the appellant was not decisive in answering the questions asked by her agent about the objectives that she had to achieve and who set them. She said both that objectives were set by the BDA but also that it was a joint decision made by the consultant and the BDA. She stated that if she did not achieve her objectives, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration would add another consultant in her sector to increase sales volume. Otherwise, the appellant recognized that there were no consequences as such if she did not reach her objectives. The appellant indicated that one time, when she did not reach her objectives because of the downturn in the new build market, her BDA proposed expanding her territory and seeking out other business opportunities to her. She confirmed that she was never subject to disciplinary measures over the fifteen (15) years that she worked as a consultant for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. In cross-examination, the appellant stated that she spoke with her BDA once or twice a week, generally on the phone. She added that she was used to working alone and that she would rarely call upon her BDA, but that her BDA could help her move things along if there was a delay in approving a mortgage financing file.\n[39] The appellant also discussed the monthly meetings organized by the BDAs that she felt obligated to participate in. During these meetings, information was provided to consultants on regulatory updates, and people were encouraged to give presentations, for example on sales strategies. The appellant explained that during these meetings, they would also discuss business development and various offices\u2019 penetration rates and that consultants\u2019 sales results would be presented.\n[40] During his testimony, Mr. Guillaumont confirmed that when he was a BDA, he had objectives to meet for his territory, which were set by management. He explained that he consequently had an informal discussion with his team of fifteen (15) to twenty (20) mortgage consultants to see what their intentions were in relation to their objectives; this allowed him to determine whether he needed to sign contracts with other consultants so that he could reach his objectives. During his testimony, Mr. Trudeau confirmed that when he was a BDA, he had this type of discussion with consultants to see what their ambitions were and appetite was for business development, with the intention of having consultants set a target. Both Mr. Guillaumont and Mr. Trudeau confirmed that there were no consequences if a consultant did not meet their objectives. That said, Mr. Guillaumont explained that when a consultant did not meet a target, he had a discussion with them to determine what was not going so well and provide them with tips and tools that they could use to increase their sales volume. He confirmed that in meetings, which he in no way considered mandatory, results were discussed. According to him, consultants, as salespeople, were interested in results as well as in how they were doing in relation to their colleagues. He took that opportunity to encourages consultants.\n[41] The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, through an external company, conducted random surveys with clients who had dealt with mortgage consultants to obtain feedback on their experience. These surveys were known as a net promoter score (NPS). The agent for the appellant provided the following example as a question that could be asked in a survey: [translation] \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Desjardins to a friend or colleague?\u201d\n[42] BDAs received the results of these surveys, and when results were poor, they could contact the consultant to discuss it. Mr. Guillaumont confirmed that he received these results when he was a BDA and that he contacted a representative once to discuss the survey and offer advice. He added that as a mortgage consultant, he had also received the results of these types of surveys, adding that this provided him with useful information on the quality of the services provided.\nFinancial risks, profits and tax returns\n[43] The appellant indicated that initially, her objective was to earn commissions around $50,000, knowing that she would first have to engage in business development, and that her commissions would be under $100,000 in her first few years. In the following years, her commissions increased to $100,000, $150,000 and beyond. I note that Mr. Guillaumont testified that when he was a BDA, the commissions earned by mortgage consultants varied between $100,000 and $300,000.\n[44] As mentioned above, section 4.4 of the contract provided that the appellant had to assume all costs, expenses and fees related to the performance of the contract. The evidence revealed that the appellant covered the costs incurred for engaging in business development and earned her income on commission. These costs included, for example, expenses related to using her car, advertising costs, entertainment expenses and telephone- and computer-related costs. She confirmed that when she submitted her documents to her accountant to prepare her tax return, she provided receipts and reported her income as a self-employed worker. It is worth noting that the appellant was not incorporated, nor was this required. She registered with the Registre des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec after working as a mortgage consultant for about ten (10) years because she wanted to change her telephone line and needed a business registration number to do so.\n[45] The appellant acknowledged that it was possible that a financing file that she prepared might not be approved, meaning that for that file, she would suffer a loss because her commission was paid only if the mortgage financing application was approved. Although this was possible, she did not indicate that she had suffered losses during the period that she worked as a mortgage consultant. In my opinion, it was possible for the appellant to suffer losses and it especially was possible to make profits; the more she increased her sales volume for not only mortgage financing but also all other Desjardins products, the more her commissions could increase. And, her commissions could fluctuate because of the nature of the work, not only in relation to the effort she put in, but also because of changes in economic conditions, and they did fluctuate.\nExclusivity and regulatory framework\n[46] Clause 5.1 of the contract provides that the mortgage consultant agrees to provide services exclusively to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and branches for processing and referring mortgage financing. The appellant testified that, unlike mortgage brokers, as a mortgage consultant, she did not have the right to sell products from banking institutions other than the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[47] The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration called Philip Ward as a witness; he was working as Senior Director of Specialized Financing and Payment Solutions at the time of the trial but had previously held various positions with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Mr. Ward stated that in all financial institutions, mortgage consultants work exclusively for their institution and that this is also provided for in the Real Estate Brokerage Act, which is the legislation that applies to the relevant period, since a new law now applies. He explained that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration had to demonstrate that it had implemented practises and procedures to ensure that it was following the applicable guiding principles for residential mortgage loan underwriting as stipulated in the guidelines of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF) and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Mr. Ward added that these guidelines are also included in the Guide.\n[48] The agent for the appellant maintained that it was the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and not regulations requiring that services be provided exclusively. Based on my understanding of the evidence presented, it seems clear that mortgage consultants, who are not brokers, are governed by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and cannot sell other institutions\u2019 products. That said, nothing prevents a broker from deciding to enter into a contract like the one signed by the appellant and become a mortgage consultant. Such a consultant would also be subject to the exclusivity clause in section 5.1, even though in principle this person, as a broker subject to the rules of practice, would have the right to sell products from various financial institutions. In his testimony, Mr. Trudeau confirmed that in order to not work exclusively for one institution, a person must be a broker and have a mortgage brokerage licence, while such a licence is not required to be a mortgage consultant. He indicated that 10 to 15% of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration's mortgage consultants have a mortgage brokerage licence that allows them to sell products from various institutions.\n[49] Whether this is the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2019s choice rather than an obligation arising from applicable legislation, I note that for the vast majority of mortgage consultants, it is the fact that they are consultants who work exclusively for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration that allows them to offer mortgage financing services without having a mortgage brokerage licence. I hasten to add that the question is rather determining what role this aspect plays in determining the existence of a relationship of subordination.\n[50] In terms of exclusivity, in Lamontagne v. M.R.N., 2018 TCC 153 (paragraph 66), Madame Justice D\u2019Auray cited Dicom Express Inc. v. Paiement, 2009 QCCA 611 (paragraphs 15-16), in which the Quebec Court of Appeal indicated the following:\n[translation] What constitutes the distinction between a contract of employment and a contract for services is the characteristic whereby the performance of the employee\u2019s work is subject to an employer\u2019s control and supervision.\nThe criterion of legal subordination is difficult to define but must not in any case be confused with economic dependence. Being bound to a sole client that imposes certain duties and obligations in terms of standards of quality of service, sets the price of the product or dictates certain advertising standards does not necessarily mean the existence of legal subordination.\n[51] Evidently, the appellant\u2019s obligation to provide services exclusively to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and branches created economic dependence for the appellant. In my opinion, this does not necessarily mean that there is a relationship of subordination. The fact that the appellant had to limit herself to selling Desjardins products is not a determining factor in establishing whether the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration controlled the performance of her work. In addition, I would like to reiterate that as a mortgage consultant without a brokerage licence, the appellant would not have been able to sell various institutions\u2019 products.\nEugenia Perrone\u2019s and France Grandchamp\u2019s testimony\n[52] Two of the witnesses called by the appellant, Eugenia Perrone and France Grandchamp\u2014mortgage consultants for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u2014also filed an appeal before this Court concerning their worker status. In an order dated October 12, 2021, Madame Justice Lafleur rejected that their appeals be combined and heard on common evidence with this appeal. I would like to reiterate, as Lafleur J. did in her order, that a factual and contextual analysis of each particular relationship must be carried out to determine the status of each worker. Their testimony is relevant only to the extent that it sheds light on the circumstances specific to the relationship between the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[53] Ms. Grandchamp confirmed the testimony of other witnesses on a number of points. Ms. Grandchamp was a mortgage consultant from 2004 to 2018. She stated that she signed a contract every year, otherwise she would not have had work. She was paid entirely on commission according to the commission scale for various products, with no benefits. She confirmed that during meetings with the BDA, consultants were informed about new products, and a table was presented indicating mortgage consultants\u2019 results. Ms. Grandchamp explained that when she did not reach her objectives, which happened for her insurance sales, which she found more of a struggle, she had a meeting with her BDA. She said that her BDA reminded her of the importance of meeting her objectives and offered tips and strategies to help her. She confirmed that she never had a remedial plan and was never subject to disciplinary measures. Ms. Grandchamp worked with an assistant whom she paid as an independent contractor, according to an agreement that they had reached.\n[54] I noted significant difference between Ms. Perrone\u2019s and the appellant\u2019s situation. For example, Ms. Perrone worked for chains, i.e. real estate brokerage offices like RE\/MAX, which was not the case for Ms. Payette. Even more significant, Ms. Perrone was a mortgage consultant from April 20, 2017, to October 3, 2018, which is after the relevant period for the appellant. Without going over her testimony in detail, I note that she confirmed the appellant's testimony on several points. When there were differences or even discrepancies, these were circumstances specific to Ms. Perrone.\nPositions of the parties\n[55] The agent for the appellant maintained that Ms. Payette was an employee because the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration extensively controlled the quantity and quality of her work. The agent for Ms. Payette referred to other aspects as indicators of employee status, such as exclusivity, ongoing training offered by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration and the fact that results were presented during meetings with BDAs. She insisted on the fact that the appellant could not amend the contract that she had to sign every year, otherwise she would not have been able to continue working as a mortgage consultant for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. The agent for the appellant read several clauses of the contract stating that they provided proof this was a contract of service. To demonstrate this, I will note a few examples. She stated that clause 3.1 of the contract and clause 2 of the Guide require the mortgage consultant to provide services personally. In fact, clause 2 of the Guide provides that the mortgage consultant must physically meet with clients at all times and obtain and verify the necessary information. According to the agent of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, this requirement stems from the obligation to confirm clients\u2019 identity and avoid fraudulent loans.\n[56] The agent for the appellant maintained that the obligation to work in collaboration with the branches as provided for in clause 3.8 of the contract as well as the obligation to submit financing applications in accordance with guidelines are obligations that are inconsistent with the status of an independent contractor. Respectfully, I do not see how the work done in collaboration between the provider of work and the worker is inconsistent with the nature of a contract of enterprise. Rather, this a question of economic dependence, and there is always a level of mutual dependence between the payer and the person providing the work. However, this is not necessarily an indicator of the true nature of the relationship between the parties. According to the agent for the appellant, the obligation to submit applications in accordance with guidelines, for example, using forms created by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration in preparing files for mortgage financing approval (clause 4.2 of the Guide) is also indicative of a contract of employment. In my opinion, this obligation also allows the mortgage consultant to collect the necessary information for the file to be analyzed and for the financing decision to be made based on regulatory requirements.\n[57] If I have understood properly, the agent for the appellant maintained that the fact that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration could add consultants in the appellant's sector indicates that she did not have control over the amount of commissions she could earn and therefore did not have the opportunity to make profits; according to the agent for the appellant, a mortgage consultant could make profits only if the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration wanted that to happen. I do not agree with this observation. Firstly, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration has an interest in all its consultants\u2019 making as much in commissions as possible and consequently making the highest possible profit. And the appellant had the opportunity to make profit that she controlled by deciding how much time and effort she wanted to invest in soliciting clients. I would also add that I find it normal that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration be able to decide to add consultants in certain sectors to acquire a larger share of the market.\n[58] In support of these claims, the appellant cited a decision, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec v. Commission des normes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail, a decision of the Tribunal administratif du travail (2019 QCTAT 4997). As indicated by the agent for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, I note that the worker in question in this case was a mortgage consultant who provided services to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, but the context of this dispute is very different from the context of the case before this Court. The question put to the Tribunal administratif du travail was related to legislation that included its own definitions and that does not apply in this case. In fact, it appears that in the context of the applicable legislation for the Tribunal administratif, whether a mortgage consultant is considered an employee is based on whether they employ assistants. Such a factor considered on its own cannot be a determining factor in this case.\n[59] The agent for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration reviewed the different pieces of evidence and maintained that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration did not control the ways in which the contract was performed and that the parties did not have a relationship of subordination, while reiterating the importance of the legislative framework in the mortgage financing field. The agent for the respondent also insisted on the relevant regulatory framework in this case, stating that the strong regulations result in nuance in how the factors are weighed. He maintained that an overall analysis of the elements to be taken into consideration in determining the legal nature of the relationship indicated a lack of a relationship of subordination.\nConclusion\n[60] It is appropriate to reiterate my conclusion that the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration had a common intention to enter into a contract of service. Once this step has been completed, the Court must determine whether the objective reality confirms this intention. I would like to reiterate this Court's obligation to examine the overall relationship between the parties to the contract and to determine whether the objective reality confirms the parties\u2019 intention. Considered in isolation, certain clauses of the contract and Guide could appear to indicate that the parties signed a contract of service.\n[61] It is important to recognize the strongly regulated context in which the facts in this case occurred. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration had an obligation to ensure compliance with the extensive statutory and regulatory requirements as well as with the AMF\u2019s and OSFI\u2019s guidelines. This adds nuance to certain elements. For example, the obligation to physically meet with clients, the obligation to use certain forms to collect relevant personal information and the obligation to have selected assistants approved are all elements that reflect these obligations and that, in my opinion, do not demonstrate the payer\u2019s control over the worker.\n[62] Many of these are elements that, when examined globally, argue in favour of a lack of a relationship of subordination. For example, the evidence demonstrated that the appellant worked from her car or from her home, determined her own work and vacation schedule, did not have paid vacation or other benefits, covered expenses incurred to earn commissions and deducted them in calculating her income, which she reported as business income, faced the risk of loss and moreover had the opportunity to make profits by increasing her sales volume, and could retain the services of an assistant.\n[63] It is true that during meetings, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration discussed objectives and sales results and that, through surveys, it evaluated the quality of the services received by clients. According to the agent for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, if clients\u2019 treatment is unsatisfactory, it is normal for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration to intervene: if low-quality services are being provided, it is normal for a payer to intervene up to and including terminating the contract if the purchased service is inadequate.\n[64] In this regard, I would like to reiterate statements made by the Federal Court of Appeal in Le Livreur Plus Inc. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 2004 FCA 68 (paragraph 19) in affirming that the Court should not \u201cconfuse control over the result or quality of the work with control over its performance by the worker responsible for doing it\u201d. The Court continued by adding that \u201c[i]t is indeed rare for a person to give out work and not to ensure that the work is performed in accordance with his or her requirements\u201d. In brief, this indication demonstrates control over the result, which does not equate control over the worker.\n[65] Having examined all relevant factors, with no individual factor being a determining factor on its own, I conclude that the appellant and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration were bound by a contract of service and that the appellant did not hold insurable employment with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration within the meaning of the EIA.\n[66] For all these reasons, the appeal is dismissed, without costs, and the decision of the Minister dated May 4, 2018, that the appellant did not hold insurable employment within the meaning of paragraph 5(1)(a) of the EIA during the relevant period is affirmed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 20th day of January, 2023.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nAPPENDIX A\nProvisions of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, CQLR, c. CCQ-1991\n1425. The common intention of the parties rather than adherence to the literal meaning of the words shall be sought in interpreting a contract.\n1426. In interpreting a contract, the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, the interpretation which has already been given to it by the parties or which it may have received, and usage, are all taken into account.\n2085. A contract of employment is a contract by which a person, the employee, undertakes, for a limited time and for remuneration, to do work under the direction or control of another person, the employer.\n2086. A contract of employment is for a fixed term or an indeterminate term.\n2098. A contract of enterprise or for services is a contract by which a person, the contractor or the provider of services, as the case may be, undertakes to another person, the client, to carry out physical or intellectual work or to supply a service, for a price which the client binds himself to pay to him.\n2099. The contractor or the provider of services is free to choose the means of performing the contract and, with respect to such performance, no relationship of subordination exists between the contractor or the provider of services and the client.\n1425. Dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, on doit rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019arr\u00eater au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes utilis\u00e9s.\n1426. On tient compte, dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, de sa nature, des circonstances dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que les parties lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9e ou qu\u2019il peut avoir re\u00e7ue, ainsi que des usages.\n2085. Le contrat de travail est celui par lequel une personne, le salari\u00e9, s\u2019oblige, pour un temps limit\u00e9 et moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, \u00e0 effectuer un travail sous la direction ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019une autre personne, l\u2019employeur.\n2086.

INTRODUCTION [1] Between 2013 and 2019, John Doe filed four appeals with respect to his 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2016 taxation years (the \u201cAppeals\u201d).\n[2] Between January 2014 and September 2022, eight status hearings were held in Vancouver, British Columbia with respect to the Appeals. During the hearings, John Doe was always self-represented.\n[3] Following the last of these hearings, this Court concluded that for John Doe\u2019s Appeals to proceed, the Court had to determine whether John Doe is under a legal disability.\n[4] By order dated May 31, 2023 (the \u201cMay 31, 2023 Order\u201d), this Court ordered counsel for the Respondent to notify the Public Guardian and Trustee of British Columbia of this Court\u2019s belief that John Doe might be under a legal disability.\nII. THE ISSUE [5] The issue is a follows:\n-Should this Court issue a confidentiality order to keep John Doe\u2019s medical information confidential?\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Obtaining a Confidentiality Order in the Tax Court of Canada \u2013 Procedural Requirements\n(1) A Request for a Confidentiality Order Must be Made with a Motion [6] Pursuant to section 16.1 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (SOR\/90\u2011688a) (the \u201cRules\u201d), this Court may, on motion by a party, order that part of a document be treated as confidential at the time of filing of the document. Section 16.1 of the Rules reads as follows:\nConfidentiality Order\n16.1 (1) On motion, the Court may order that a document or part of a document shall be treated as confidential at the time of filing of the document or part of the document and determines the conditions in relation to its reproduction, destruction and non-disclosure.\n(2) Where the Court makes an order pursuant to subsection (1), a party or solicitor of record may have access to the confidential document or part of the confidential document only on conditions determined by the Court in relation to its reproduction, destruction and non-disclosure.\n(3) The order remains in effect until the Court orders otherwise.\n[7] Consequently, in order for a confidentiality order to be issued by this Court, a motion must be made by a party. In this case, neither John Doe nor counsel for the Respondent made such motion. Given the circumstances, more specifically because of the Court\u2019s belief that John Doe might be under a legal disability and because medical information about John Doe has been disclosed in the proceedings, the Court has concluded that it should, on its own motion, determine whether a confidentiality order should be issued to keep John Doe\u2019s medical information confidential.\n[8] In my view, John Doe\u2019s medical information should be kept confidential until this Court determines whether he is under a legal disability pursuant to the Rules.\n[9] In Canada v Dow Chemical Canada ULC,[1] the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada described the source of the Tax Court of Canada\u2019s authority to control its process as follows:\nIn Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, at paragraph 33, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Federal Court does not have any inherent jurisdiction, but rather only the jurisdiction conferred on it by statute. Since the Tax Court is also a statutory court, this finding applies equally to the Tax Court. \u2026\nAlthough the Tax Court does not have any inherent jurisdiction, it does have an implied jurisdiction by necessary implication. In R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10, at paragraph 19, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that statutory courts have an implied jurisdiction by necessary implication to carry out the functions of a court. Since the Tax Court is a statutory court, it also has this implied jurisdiction. Therefore, \u201c... the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime ...\u201d (ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, at paragraph 51).[2]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[10] On the basis of this decision, my view is that I have the authority to issue a confidentiality order on my own initiative when it is in the interests of justice to do so in the circumstances. I am also of the view that such circumstances include situations where a taxpayer is self-represented and the Court believes that the taxpayer might be under a legal disability. In such a situation, the Court cannot expect that the taxpayer is able to request a confidentiality order on their own. Furthermore, section 9 of the Rules states that the Court may, where and as necessary in the interests of justice, dispense with compliance with any rule at any time. It is necessary in this case.\n[11] Consequently, this Court must take action to determine whether John Doe\u2019s medical information should be kept confidential until it can be determined whether he in under a legal disability pursuant to the Rules.[3]\n(2) When the Motion Should be Made [12] Pursuant to Section 16.1 the Rules, if a motion is made and granted, this Court may order that a document or part of a document be treated as confidential at the time of filing of the document. The expression \u201cat the time of filing of the document\u201d and common sense dictate that, in principle, such motion must be made at the time of filing of documents and not after the documents are already part of the Court\u2019s file. Applying this reasoning to the trial transcripts, a motion to keep part of a trial transcript confidential should be made at the beginning of a proceeding or right before the confidential information is discussed at trial.\n[13] As previously stated, section 9 of the Rules allows the Court to dispense with compliance with any rule at any time where and as necessary in the interests of justice. Again, I am of the view that given the circumstances, it is in the interests of justice to allow the Court to determine whether John Doe\u2019s medical information, which has already been disclosed, should be made confidential at this time.\n(3) Another Requirement [14] In Atomic Energy of Canada Limited v Sierra Club of Canada,[4] the Supreme Court of Canada stated that in order to obtain a confidentiality order, an applicant must demonstrate that the information that is requested to be kept confidential has been treated at all relevant times as confidential. The Court stated the following at paragraph 60 of the decision:\n\u2026 Such an order requires the applicant to demonstrate that the information in question has been treated at all relevant times as confidential and that on a balance of probabilities its proprietary, commercial and scientific interests could reasonably be harmed by the disclosure of the information: AB Hassle v. Canada (Minister of National Health & Welfare) (1998), 83 C.P.R. (3d) 428 (F.C. T.D.), at p. 434. To this I would add the requirement proposed by Robertson J.A. that the information in question must be of a \u201cconfidential nature\u201d in that it has been \u201caccumulated with a reasonable expectation of it being kept confidential\u201d as opposed to \u201cfacts which a litigant would like to keep confidential by having the courtroom doors closed\u201d (para.14).\n[15] In this case, the information that this Court believes should be kept as confidential is medical information. This information is of a \u201cconfidential nature\u201d. In Osif v College of Physicians & Surgeons (Nova Scotia), the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal stated that confidentiality is a hallmark of the relationship between health care professionals and their patients; that there is no question that the public considers that their medical records are confidential and expects that, except in limited circumstances, they will remain confidential; and that the confidentiality of such records is an important public interest.[5] I agree.\n[16] The Court believes that John Doe\u2019s medical information was collected by his doctor(s) with the expectation that it would be kept confidential. The information was only disclosed to the Court to support adjournment requests, including because John Doe was or had been hospitalized and\/or was under the influence of medication.\n[17] For these reasons, this Court has concluded that John Doe\u2019s medical information has been treated at all relevant times as confidential.\nB. Analytical Framework for the Exercise of the Judge\u2019s Discretion to Issue a Confidentiality Order\n[18] Generally, the public can attend hearings and consult court files and the press is left free to inquire and comment on the workings of the courts.[6] The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized on numerous occasions that the open court principle is protected by the constitutionally entrenched right of freedom of expression.[7]\n[19] A person can seek an exception to the open court principle and ask a court to keep information confidential. In Sherman Estate v Donovan, the Supreme Court of Canada revisited the test that it established in Sierra Club for the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion to keep information confidential. The Court stated that in order to succeed and obtain a confidentiality order, the person asking a court to exercise its discretion must establish the following:\n-Court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest;\n-The order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and\n-As a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.[8]\n(1) Court Openness Poses a Serious Risk to an Important Public Interest [20] The Court must determine whether the disclosure of John Doe\u2019s medical information would pose a serious risk to a \u201cpublic interest\u201d. Consequently, to answer this question, the Court must determine whether a person\u2019s medical information is of \u201cpublic interest\u201d.\n[21] A person\u2019s medical information is private by nature. In Sherman Estate, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the right to privacy is an important public interest only in certain circumstances. This is because the recognition of a public interest in privacy could threaten the strong presumption of openness if privacy is cast too broadly without a view to its public character.[9] The Court stated that in order to establish a serious risk to an important public interest for the purposes of the test, it is not sufficient to simply demonstrate the existence of any impact on individual privacy.[10]\n[22] A person\u2019s dignity is a dimension of a person\u2019s privacy. The protection of dignity is an important public interest that can be threatened by open courts.[11] The Supreme Court of Canada explained that in order to preserve the integrity of the open court principle, an important public interest concerned with the protection of dignity should be understood to be seriously at risk only in limited cases.[12]\n[23] The Supreme Court of Canada stated that \u201cprotecting individuals from the threat to their dignity that arises when information revealing core aspects of their private lives is disseminated through open court proceedings is an important public interest for the purposes of the test\u201d.[13] For the Supreme Court, the interest is ultimately about safeguarding a person\u2019s dignity, and that interest will be undermined when the information reveals something sensitive about them as an individual, as opposed to generic information that reveals little if anything about who they are as a person.[14] Therefore, information can be kept confidential if it consists of intimate or personal details about an individual.[15] In my view, this applies to a person\u2019s medical information, especially medical information of the nature of John Doe\u2019s.\n[24] Furthermore, in Canadian Broadcasting Corp v The Queen, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that situations requiring the protection of vulnerable individuals justify limiting court openness.[16] In my view, John Doe is a vulnerable individual and limiting court openness in order to protect his medical information is justified. John Doe\u2019s right to privacy includes the right to keep his medical information private because it reveals personal, sensitive information about him. Furthermore, as stated in Osif, [17] confidentiality is a hallmark of the relationship between health care professionals and their patients and there is no question that the public considers that their medical records are confidential and expects that they will remain confidential.\n[25] In this case, in my view, John Doe\u2019s medical information is sufficiently sensitive that court openness would pose a serious risk to an important public interest since the information is about a mental illness. Sensitive personal information that, if exposed, could give rise to a serious risk includes information related to stigmatized medical conditions.[18]\n[26] Consequently, the Court has concluded that court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest, that is, to John Doe\u2019s privacy and more specifically to his dignity.\n(2) The Order Sought is Necessary to Prevent this Serious Risk to the Identified Interest Because Reasonably Alternative Measures Will not Prevent this Risk [27] The Court has to consider whether alternative measures to the confidentiality order can be taken, as well as determine what the scope of the order should be to ensure that it is not overly broad.[19]\n[28] In this case, there is no alternative to a confidentiality order. The submission into evidence of John Doe\u2019s medical information was and is necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the Appeals since the information that should be kept confidential had to be disclosed to support adjournment requests. Furthermore, the same information has been used by this Court to conclude that John Doe might be under a legal disability and is included in the May 31, 2023 Order. Given that the information is necessary to John Doe\u2019s case, it had to be disclosed.\n[29] With respect to the scope of the order, the Court has to ensure that it is not overly broad. The Court has considered four options. The first is to seal the entire file. The second is to redact all medical information from all of the documents in the Court file. The third option is to replace John Doe\u2019s name with a pseudonym in the entire file. The fourth option is to seal most of the file and replace John Doe\u2019s name with a pseudonym in the documents that are not sealed.\n[30] Sealing the entire file is not the option chosen by the Court as other more targeted options are available that will allow the Court to achieve the ultimate goal, that is, to keep John Doe\u2019s medical information private.\n[31] It is difficult to redact the documents because some of them include practically only medical information. They had to be filed in their entirety to ensure a better understanding of the issues and while they could be redacted, they would have to be almost entirely redacted. Furthermore, redacting all of John Doe\u2019s medical information from all documents filed with the Court, and especially from the hundreds of pages of the trial transcripts, would be impractical. This would put an unreasonable burden on the Court and would not be a good use of judicial resources.\n[32] For the same reasons, redacting John Doe\u2019s name from all documents filed with the Court is not the option chosen by the Court.\n[33] The fourth option is the one that has been chosen by the Court. The entire file should be sealed, with the exception of two documents, until it is determined whether John Doe is under a legal disability. The issue should be revisited once this matter is resolved and the documents and trial transcripts can be redacted if necessary by John Doe or by his counsel. Only the May 31, 2023 Order and this Confidentiality Order will not be sealed, but they will be redacted by the Court to replace the Appellant\u2019s name with the pseudonym \u201cJohn Doe\u201d. Other information will have to be redacted by the Court in order to be keep John Doe\u2019s identity confidential. This information can be easily identified and redacted. This will ensure that John Doe\u2019s identity is kept confidential and therefore his right to privacy and his dignity will be respected. This will also keep the hearing as public as possible.\n(3) As a Matter of Proportionality, the Benefits of the Order Outweigh its Negative Effects [34] At this stage, the Court must determine whether the salutary effects of the confidentiality order outweigh the negative effects of the confidentiality order, including the effects on the principle of open and accessible court proceedings.[20]\n[35] In this case, the Court is of the view that the salutary effects of the confidentiality order outweigh its negative effects because the right to privacy will be protected while the relevant facts on the substantive issue will be kept part of the public record. John Doe risks being subject to serious harm if his identity is not kept confidential and the harm to the public interest and to the open court principle is minimal because the information on the issue of whether he is under a legal disability is still available to the public while the information on his tax issues will be disclosed later, after the legal disability issue is resolved.\nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\nthe entire Court files for file numbers 2013-954(IT)G, 2015-3261(IT)G, 2019-3239(IT)G and 2019-4191(IT)G shall be sealed, with the exception of the following two documents:\n-the redacted version of the May 31, 2023 Order; and\n-the redacted version of this Confidentiality Order.\nthe May 31, 2023 Order shall be redacted by the Court to protect the identity of John Doe;\nthis Confidentiality Order shall be redacted by the Court to protect the identity of John Doe;\nthe following exceptions are made to paragraph 1 above:\n-The parties, their counsel, anyone else acting on behalf of the parties, and the Court and its staff may have access to the Court file as needed;\n-The Public Guardian and Trustee may have access to the unredacted version of the May 31, 2023 Order and to the unredacted version of this Confidentiality Order;\nthe parties, their counsel, or anyone else acting on behalf of the parties are prohibited from making public any information that has the effect of identifying the Appellant;\nany proceedings in these Appeals shall be heard in the absence of the public unless prior authorization of the Court is obtained; and\nthis Confidentiality Order shall continue to be in effect until the Court orders that it be revised or amended based on circumstances that may arise as the case progresses.\nTHIS COURT INSTRUCTS the Court Registrar and any official court reporter to take all appropriate measures to ensure compliance with this order.\nWithout costs.\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 21st day of June 2023.\nOuimet J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 92\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2013-954(IT)G, 2015-3261(IT)G,\n2019-3239(IT)G, 2019-4191(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJOHN DOE AND\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Sylvain Ouimet\nDATE OF ORDER:\nJune 21, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nNadine Taylor Pickering\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Canada v Dow Chemical Canada ULC, 2022 FCA 70 [Dow Chemical].\n[2] Dow Chemical at paras 79\u201380.\n[3] Practice Note No. 16 of the Tax Court states that the Court may on its own initiative redact from pleadings personal and confidential information.

Overview\n[1] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant, Amex Bank of Canada (hereinafter \u201cAmex\u201d or the \u201cAppellant\u201d), is entitled to input tax credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) for GST\/HST paid on expenses arising in connection with the administration and operation of Amex\u2019s Membership Rewards Program (\u201cMRP\u201d), including expenses incurred for the purpose of providing its Members with Rewards on the redemption of Points.[1]\n[2] Under the Excise Tax Act (Canada)[2] (the \u201cETA\u201d), ITCs cannot be claimed to the extent the expenses are incurred for inputs used by a registrant to make exempt supplies of financial services. In this case, the GST\/HST is borne by the provider of the exempt supplies. The reason why the provider of exempt supplies is not entitled to claim ITCs is because the supplier of exempt financial services is not subject to GST under the ETA. Because of this, the scheme of the ETA operates in a way to ensure that the tax is borne by the maker of exempt supplies and not the recipient of the supply.\n[3] The Appellant\u2019s position is that it provided multiple supplies, some taxable and others exempt. According to the Appellant, all of the GST\/HST that it has paid on expenses incurred under its MRP was incurred in the course of making taxable supplies, which are separate and distinct from the other exempt supplies made by the Appellant to its Cardholders.\n[4] The position of the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) is the polar opposite of the Appellant\u2019s position. The Minister claims that the expenses incurred under the MRP, including those related to the purchase of Rewards, constitute a single composite supply. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the predominant element of the composite supply is an exempt financial service such that the Minister was correct to deny the Appellant\u2019s claims for ITCs.\nII. Partial Agreed Statement of Facts\n[5] The parties filed a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (\u201cPASF\u201d). I have reproduced it for ease of reference.[3]\nA. Facts\nBackground\n1. The Appellant . . . was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on June 22, 1987 and continued under the Bank Act (Canada) on April 25, 1990 and has been thereafter a Schedule II bank regulated under the Bank Act (Canada).\n2. Amex is, and was throughout Amex\u2019s 2002 through 2012 annual reporting periods (the \u201cRelevant Periods\u201d), registered for the Goods and Services Tax\/Harmonized Sales Tax (the \u201cGST\/HST\u201d) under Part IX of the ETA.\n3. Amex issued American Express charge cards and credit cards (collectively, \u201cCards\u201d) to members of the public (\u201cCardholders\u201d) who applied for and qualified for such Cards.\n4. Amex Canada Inc. (\u201cACI\u201d) is an Ontario corporation and, during the Relevant Periods, was a member of a \u201cclosely related group\u201d (as that term is defined in the ETA) with Amex.\n5. During the Relevant Periods, ACI carried on the business of, inter alia, providing travel agency services to the public.\nThe Membership Rewards Program\n6. During the Relevant Periods, Amex operated a loyalty program known as the Membership Rewards Program (the \u201cMRP\u201d).\n7. A Cardholder who was a member of the MRP (a \u201cMember\u201d) accrued and was credited with a certain number of points (the \u201cPoints\u201d) by Amex for each dollar charged to a Card for the purchase of goods or services.\n8. Under the MRP, Amex did not credit a Member with Points for amounts charged to a Card for, inter alia, delinquency fees, interest, Card fees, purchases of American Express Travellers Cheques and Gift Cheques, balance transfers, or the purchase of foreign currency.\n9. The more dollar value of eligible purchases a Cardholder charged on the Card, the more Points the Cardholder earned.\n10. The more Points a Cardholder accumulated, the more Rewards (as defined below) or the higher the value of the Reward a Cardholder could redeem from Amex.\nBecoming a Member of the MRP\n11. Participation in the MRP was available only to Cardholders.\n12. Amex offered a variety of Cards with different rights and obligations attached to each.\n13. Some Cards required the Cardholder to pay an annual fee to Amex (a \u201cCard Fee\u201d), with different Card Fees payable for different Cards.\n14. Amex did not charge Cardholders GST\/HST on the Card Fees.\nMRP Fees\n15. Some Cards (the \u201cMRP\u2011Inclusive Cards\u201d) carried with them enrollment of the Cardholder in the MRP with no additional enrollment fee charged to the Cardholder.\n16. For other Cards (the \u201cMRP\u2011Extra Cards\u201d), a Cardholder had the option (but was not required) to join the MRP by paying Amex an enrollment fee (the \u201cMRP Enrollment Fee\u201d) (the MRP\u2011Inclusive Cards, together with all MRP\u2011Extra Cards whose Cardholders opted to join the MRP, are collectively referred to as \u201cMRP Cards\u201d).\n17. MRP\u2011Extra Cardholders could enroll in, or withdraw from, the MRP at any time.\n18. Amex charged MRP\u2011Extra Cardholders GST\/HST on the MRP Enrollment Fee.\n19. Under some MRP Cards, a Member had the option to pay an extra fee (the \u201cPoints Accelerator Fee\u201d) to be entitled to be credited with a higher ratio of Points per dollar charged to a Card.\n20. Amex charged Members GST\/HST on the Points Accelerator Fees.\nClaiming Rewards\n21. A Member was entitled to exchange or redeem his or her accrued Points for various rewards (the \u201cRewards\u201d) such as airline tickets, airline frequent flyer points, hotel chain loyalty points, travel certificates, meals at restaurants, gift cards and tangible items such as watches, golf clubs, luggage and headphones.\n22. A Member was required to redeem a specific number of Points to claim any particular Reward.\n23. Amex determined the number of Points required for each Reward.\n24. It was Amex that determined limitations on MRP Point redemptions for a Reward.\n25. Subject to certain conditions, if a Member did not have enough Points to claim a particular Reward, the Member could purchase from Amex for a fee (the \u201cPoints Fee\u201d) the additional Points required.\n26. Amex charged Members GST\/HST on the Points Fee.\nThe Participation Agreements\n27. To ensure that there were Rewards available for its Members, Amex entered into agreements (\u201cParticipation Agreements\u201d) with suppliers (the \u201cParticipants\u201d) of various Rewards.\n28. Under each Participation Agreement, Amex agreed to pay the Participant a negotiated amount of money for providing the Rewards.\n29. The Rewards purchased by Amex from the various Participants are offered and provided to the Cardholders, in exchange for Points.\n30. The Members did not pay Amex or the Participants for obtaining the Rewards (other than by redeeming Points and\/or purchasing additional Points).\n31. The Participants charged Amex and Amex paid the Participants GST\/HST where applicable (the \u201cParticipant GST\u201d), in respect of the Participants\u2019 supplies of goods and services that are being used as Rewards.\nThe ACI Participants Agreements\n32. Amex and ACI also entered into Participation Agreements that were in place throughout the Relevant Periods (the \u201cACI Participation Agreements\u201d).\n33. Under the ACI Participation Agreements, a Member could exchange a specific number of Points for a certificate (a \u201cTravel Certificate\u201d) from Amex that would have a fixed face value (e.g., $100, $500, etc.).\n34. A Member who acquired a Travel Certificate from Amex could redeem it with ACI or an ACI\u2011franchised travel agency (collectively, \u201cACI\u201d) up to the fixed face value to pay for all or part of travel products or services (with the Member paying ACI for any remaining costs).\n35. If a Member used a Travel Certificate as aforesaid, ACI would invoice Amex for the Travel Certificate, which Amex would pay to ACI (the \u201cTravel Certificate Payments\u201d).\n36. It was Amex that determined the denominations for Travel Certificates that may be issued.\nAmex\u2019s Card Operations\n37. A Cardholder could present a Card to a store as payment instead of cash. Amex would pay the Canadian store the amount charged on the Card (less a discount or merchant fee). Amex would then send the Cardholder a monthly statement with the total of all payments charged by that Cardholder to that Card that month (the \u201cCard Operations\u201d).\n38. Most of Amex\u2019s domestic supplies made in the course of its Card Operations during the Relevant Periods were \u201cexempt supplies\u201d for ETA purposes such that no GST\/HST was charged by Amex on Card Fees, discount fees and delinquency charges or interest on late\u2011paid account balances.\nAmex\u2019s MRP Operations\n39. In the course of operating the MRP, Amex paid system maintenance and other overhead costs (the \u201cOverhead\u201d) used in connection with the MRP.\n40. Amex self\u2011assessed, under Division IV of the ETA, GST\/HST on the Overhead (the \u201cOverhead GST\u201d).\nAmex\u2019s Revenue and Expenses\n41. At all relevant times, Amex earned substantial revenue from credit card and charge card operations.\n42. In 2009 and 2010, the revenue received from the credit\/charge cards was more than 96% of Amex\u2019s total revenue, whereas the revenue from the MRP fees accounted for under 0.75% of Amex\u2019s total revenue.\n43. At all relevant times, interest income, transaction charges, and discount revenue earned from the credit\/charge card operations were Amex\u2019s largest revenue sources.\n44. The more a Cardholder spent using an Amex Card, the more discount revenue Amex earned.\n45. At all relevant times, MRP Points redemption cost was an expense of Amex on its income statement.\n46. At all relevant times, reserves for the estimated cost of anticipated MRP Points redemption were recorded as a liability on Amex\u2019s balance sheet.\nCalculation of Net Tax\n47. For the Relevant Periods, Amex filed its GST\/HST returns.\n48. In calculating its net tax for each Relevant Period, Amex claimed ITCs on the Participant GST and the Overhead GST, and claimed ITCs under subsection 181(5) in respect of GST\/HST (the \u201cNotional GST\u201d) that Amex was deemed to have paid in respect of the Travel Certificate Payments.\n49. With respect to the Participant GST, Amex claimed ITCs as follows:\n(i) in its GST\/HST returns for its 2002 through 2012 reporting periods, a portion of the Participant GST based on the percentage of the MRP\u2011Extra Cards to the total of all MRP Cards issued (the \u201cFee Extra Ratio\u201d); and\n(ii) in its GST\/HST returns for its 2005 and 2008 reporting periods, Amex also claimed the balance of the Participant GST paid and not claimed in those years and in the immediately two preceding years it applied the Fee Extra Ratio.\nThe Assessments\n50.

In making the Assessments, the Minister denied the above\u2011noted ITCs and, as a result of such denials and other adjustments that are not being appealed, assessed Amex additional net tax plus penalties and interest.\n52. Amex filed Notices of Objection to the Assessments.\n53. The Minister confirmed each of the Assessments with respect to the denial of ITCs related to the MRP through Notices of Confirmation dated December 10, 2018 and December 17, 2018 (the \u201cConfirmations\u201d).\n54. Throughout the Relevant Periods, Amex and ACI were parties to an election under section 150 of the ETA and did not revoke such election throughout the Relevant Periods.\n[6] The defined terms used hereinafter have the meaning assigned to them in the PASF unless otherwise provided. In this regard, the Overhead expenses, Travel Certificates, and payments made to Participants for Rewards are collectively defined as the \u201cMRP Expenses\u201d.\nIII. Viva Voce Evidence\n[7] Mr. Joseph Ryan, who is presently a vice president of the Appellant and responsible for the MRP, testified as the first witness on behalf of the Appellant. Mr. Ryan\u2019s testimony covered the administration and operation of the MRP as well as the Appellant\u2019s dealings with Participants and ACI.\n[8] Mr. Ryan\u2019s testimony, for the most part, was consistent with the PASF and the documentary evidence submitted jointly by the parties. That said, one part of his evidence was largely contradicted by other evidence, including his own testimony.\n[9] Mr. Ryan insisted that one of the purposes pursued by the Appellant under the MRP was the promotion of the Participants\u2019 activities through advertising and marketing to its Members. This part of his testimony was key to the Appellant\u2019s argument that one of the purposes of the MRP was the promotion of the endeavours of the Participants.\n[10] The Appellant claims that Mr. Ryan\u2019s testimony is bolstered by the pitch books used to enroll Participants under the MRP.[4]\n[11] I do not share the Appellant\u2019s assessment that considerable weight should be attached to Mr. Ryan\u2019s evidence in this regard for the following reasons.\n[12] First, a large portion of the pitch book was devoted to describing the benefits procured by Amex under the MRP.[5] The substantial benefits that the MRP procured to Amex were highlighted during the Respondent\u2019s cross\u2011examination of Mr. Ryan.\n[13] For example, on cross\u2011examination Mr. Ryan stated that the provision of Rewards was made to influence a Member\u2019s spending behaviour. Spending behaviour and accompanying credit card revenue is enhanced because Amex selects, promotes and offers attractive Rewards that are greatly desired by its Members. Amex\u2019s marketing material for Rewards is designed to drive spending on Amex Cards by Members and promote loyalty.[6]\n[14] Why does Amex focus on the above? Mr. Ryan recognized during his cross\u2011examination that Amex promotes attractive Rewards to drive spending because a substantial portion of Amex\u2019s revenue is derived from spending by Members for goods and services charged to an Amex credit card.[7]\n[15] The following part of Mr. Ryan\u2019s testimony highlights the Appellant\u2019s reason for emphasizing to prospective Participants the benefits of Amex\u2019s marketing of and promotion of Rewards procured from them.\nTHE COURT: From your perspective, presumably all of the pitching that you are doing is leaning towards a price - -\nTHE WITNESS: Exactly.\nTHE COURT: - - that goods is going to be redeemed at?\nTHE WITNESS: Correct.\nTHE COURT: Is that price the price that the merchant normally charges its clients or is it a different price?\nTHE WITNESS: It\u2019s generally a different price. If I take a gift card, which is a simple example, it might have a face value of $100, we would have a price that we would purchase those gift cards at which was less than the face value. We would then set the amount of points for that redemption of that gift card, if that makes sense.[8]\n[16] In my opinion, this statement identifies that Amex regularly promotes Rewards to its Members to reinforce the attractiveness of the MRP to derive Members\u2019 spending on Amex credit cards. This is something that Amex must do in any event for its own purpose.\n[17] With this backdrop in mind, I believe that Amex emphasized the marketing and promotion of the Rewards in its discussions with prospective and existing Participants to great effect, namely, to achieve Amex\u2019s goal, which was to secure the procurement of attractive Rewards for its Members at the lowest possible price. From the evidence, I infer that Amex intended to spend money on marketing and promoting Rewards in any event.\n[18] Spending behaviour and accompanying credit card revenue is enhanced because Amex selects, promotes and offers attractive Rewards that are greatly desired by its Members. Amex\u2019s marketing material for Rewards is designed to drive spending on Amex Cards by Members and promote loyalty.[9]\n[19] Considering all of the above, I believe that Amex promoted Rewards because it suited Amex\u2019s purpose to do so.\n[20] On cross\u2011examination, Mr. Ryan\u2019s demeanor changed somewhat. He became argumentative when documentary evidence from the Joint Book of Documents was used by counsel for the Respondent to establish the purpose and use of the supplies made by the Appellant under the MRP. Mr. Ryan appeared to be reluctant to answer simple yes or no questions.[10] Mr. Ryan appeared to me to be well\u2011informed of how to formulate answers that would be helpful to the Appellant\u2019s case. In the end, I found his testimony to be somewhat rehearsed.[11]\n[21] The second and last witness to appear on behalf of the Appellant was Ms. Orleen Sinclair, the Director of Indirect Tax for the Appellant. Her testimony consisted largely of a review of the Appellant\u2019s claim for ITCs in respect of the MRP Expenses, particularly how it changed over time in light of the audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d).\n[22] Specifically, Ms. Sinclair testified that the Appellant\u2019s initial approach (the \u201cInitial Method\u201d) to claiming ITCs with respect to the MRP Expenses (excluding redemption payments for Travel Certificates) and notional ITCs (\u201cNITCs\u201d) for redemption payments for Travel Certificates was based on an allocation method. The Appellant\u2019s initial position in that regard was that supplies made to Members with MRP-Extra Cards who elected to become Members of the MRP for a fee received taxable supplies under the MRP. The Members who were automatically enrolled in the MRP with MRP\u2013Inclusive Cards were treated as having received exempt financial services under the MRP. Ms. Sinclair then added up all of the HST paid on MRP Expenses on an allocation method that was based on the percentage obtained by the number of Members who paid an initial fee and annual renewal fee to become Members divided by the number of Cards held by all Members. The recovery rate of ITCs under the Initial Method worked out to 19.14% of all GST\/HST paid in connection with the MRP Expenses.[12]\n[23] Ms. Sinclair explained that Amex decided to abandon the Initial Method after the CRA began an audit that culminated in the denial of all of the Appellant\u2019s initial ITCs claim based on the aforementioned allocation method. In 2005, the Appellant filed an additional claim seeking to obtain a refund equal to the amount of difference between 100% of the GST\/HST paid in connection with the MRP Expenses and the amount of GST\/HST initially claimed by the Appellant. Likewise, in 2008, the Appellant filed an additional claim based on the methodology described immediately above. The Appellant\u2019s revised claims were based on the premise that only taxable supplies were made in connection with the MRP, thus 100% of the GST\/HST charged to the Appellant on the MRP Expenses should be refunded to the Appellant. That is the position that the Appellant defends in its appeal before this Court.\n[24] Ms. Sinclair clarified that the Appellant claimed NITCs only in respect of Travel Certificates accepted by ACI franchisees for travel and accommodation obtained as Rewards through the services of franchisees. No NITCs were claimed when Travel Certificates were accepted by ACI to book travel or hotel accommodations for Members. The latter redemptions were treated differently than the former because of the section 150 election entered into ACI and the election. By virtue of this election, all supplies between ACI and Amex are deemed to be supplies of exempt financial services.\n[25] Ms. Sinclair was asked questions about accounting standards that were applied to defer part of the merchant discount revenue earned by the Appellant to match it to the value of the Amex\u2019s accrued but unrealized Point liability. She recognized that she was not qualified to speak to this issue. Both the Respondent and I were disappointed with this admission as the Appellant\u2019s counsel had led us earlier to believe that Ms. Sinclair would testify on Amex\u2019s accounting treatment of merchant discount revenue and MRP Expenses and that she was competent to do so.[13]\n[26] Ms. Julie Ho, who is presently a manager of the CRA Business Integration and Program Operations Division, appeared as the sole witness of the Respondent. She was a CRA appeals officer when she received carriage of the Appellant\u2019s file following its Notices of Objection for the Relevant Periods. Her testimony was largely a recital of her understanding of the relevant facts, which is consistent with the facts alleged in the Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal. She also testified on her reasons for recommending a confirmation of the assessments.\n[27] Ms. Ho stated that she decided to recommend that all of the Appellant\u2019s ITC claims should be denied because no separate taxable supplies were made by Amex to Members under the MRP. According to Ms. Ho, the elements and components of the MRP were intertwined and linked to the supply of exempt financial services made by Amex to its Members. The predominant element of that single supply was the supply of exempt financial services.[14] Consistent with that observation, Ms. Ho also stated that the auditor made an error in allowing a credit for the GST\/HST collected in error by Amex on the annual and renewal fees because those amounts should have been refunded to the Members who paid the GST\/HST and not the Appellant.[15] Nothing further needs to be said about Ms. Ho\u2019s testimony.\nIV.

General Observations on the Law and the Parties\u2019 Positions\n[29] As noted earlier, the key issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is entitled to claim ITCs with respect to the GST\/HST that it paid on the MRP Expenses. Under subsection 169(1), the Appellant is entitled to claim ITCs only to the extent that the MRP Expenses are incurred as inputs for the consumption, use or supply in the course of commercial activities of the Appellant. Similarly, one of the conditions that must be met for the Appellant to be able to claim ITCs under subsection 181(5) of the ETA in respect of Travel Certificate Payments is that the payment must have been made by the Appellant in the course of a commercial activity of the Appellant. A business that involves the making of exempt supplies is excluded from the definition of a commercial activity. As noted in the numerous cases cited by the parties, both of these questions call for an inherently fact\u2011driven determination.\n[30] With the above backdrop in mind, first, I must consider whether Amex incurs the MRP Expenses in the course of a single composite supply made to its Members. In other words, are the elements and components of the MRP intertwined and linked to the financial services made by Amex to its Members.\n[31] Secondly, if I determine that the MRP Expenses are incurred by the Appellant in the course of a single supply, I must then determine the nature of that supply having regards to its predominant element.\n(1) Single Supply versus Multiple Supplies [32] The analytical approach defined in the relevant case law is to determine whether there are single or multiple supplies. This determination is to be made by applying what is commonly referred to as the \u201ccomposite supply test\u201d. Under this test, if an alleged separate supply is, in substance or reality, an integral part, integrant or component of the overall supply, then that alleged separate supply will be considered a part of the overall supply as a single composite supply. This requires observing the degree that the elements or components are interconnected, and the extent of their interdependence and intertwining.[17] The Federal Court of Appeal has also examined the commercial efficacy of the arrangement in considering whether there is a single composite supply.[18] It is on this particular point that the parties disagree.\n[33] The Appellant claims that it is entitled to claim ITCs in respect of the MRP Expenses (excluding the Travel Certificate Payments under subsection 169(1) and the Travel Certificate Payments under subsection 181(5)) because these expenses were incurred in the course of commercial activities carried on by the Appellant. The reasoning underlining the Appellant\u2019s arguments appears to be as follows:\nThe MRP is an undertaking with its own dedicated employees and dedicated information technology. MRP\u2011Extra Cardholders must enroll and pay a nominal fee to become Members of the MRP. This is optional. Cardholders who choose not to enroll in the MRP continue to receive exempt supplies of financial services. According to the Appellant, this means that the supplies made under the MRP are not linked to and intertwined with supplies made by Amex in its credit card business.\nMembers may acquire Points for cash if additional Points are needed to acquire a Reward. The Appellant did not provide evidence as to the amounts of Points acquired for cash by Members during the Relevant Period. I infer from the evidence considered as a whole that the amount of Points purchased by Members for cash was nominal compared with the Points accumulated by Members in connection with spending on their Amex credit card.\nExpenses are incurred to provide Rewards to Members.\nMarketing and promotional expenses are incurred by Amex to provide promotional services to Participants.[19]\n[34] In its written submissions, the Appellant quotes extensively from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Calgary (City) v. Canada, 2012 SCC 20, wherein the Court endorsed the decision of the Tax Court in OA Brown Ltd. v Canada, [1995] GSTC 40 (TCC). The relevant passages are reproduced below for ease of reference:[20]\nThe test to determine whether there is a single or multiple supply for purposes of the Excise Tax Act was summarized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Calgary (City) v. Canada, 2012 SCC 20, wherein the Court cited the seminal case of O.A. Brown Ltd. v. Canada, [1995] G.S.T.C. 40 (T.C.C.):\n[32] In determining whether a supplier has made a single supply or multiple supplies, the relevant principles were summarized by Justice Rip (as he then was) in O.A. Brown Ltd. v. Canada, [1995] G.S.T.C. 40 (T.C.C.). His approach was confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Hidden Valley Golf Resort Assn. v. R., [2000] G.S.T.C. 42.\n\u2026\n[35] O.A. Brown established the following test to determine whether a particular set of facts revealed single or multiple supplies for the purposes of the ETA:\nThe test to be distilled from the English authorities is whether, in substance and reality, the alleged separate supply is an integral part, integrant or component of the overall supply. One must examine the true nature of the transaction to determine the tax consequences. [p. 40\u20116]\n[36] When reaching his decision, Justice Rip made the following observation:\n. . . one should look at the degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are interconnected, the extent of their interdependence and intertwining, whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. [p. 40\u20116]\n(Citing Mercantile Contracts Ltd. v. Customs & Excise Commissioners, File No. LON\/88\/786, U.K. (unreported).)\n[37] Justice Rip also noted the importance of common sense when the determination is made. McArthur T.C.J. made a similar observation in Gin Max Enterprises Inc. v. R., 2007 TCC 223, [2007] G.S.T.C. 56, at para. 18:\nFrom a review of the case law, the question of whether two elements constitute a single supply or two or multiple supplies requires an analysis of the true nature of the transactions and it is a question of fact determined with a generous application of common sense.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[35] There is no dispute between the parties that this is the analytical approach that I must apply to determine this issue.\n[36] The Respondent also emphasizes in his oral and written submissions that the written agreement and documentation are of paramount importance in making the aforesaid determination. There is no dispute between the parties on this point.\n[37] Furthermore, the Appellant submits pursuant to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. R, 2021 FCA 96, that the determination of whether a recipient receives a single supply or multiple supplies must be determined from the standpoint of the recipient of the supply.[21] Once again, the parties agree that this is the approach to be followed to determine this question.[22]\n[38] I begin my analysis with a review of the sample of the terms and conditions of the Membership Rewards Program (the \u201cMRP Terms and Conditions\u201d).[23] Article 3.2(ii) provides that Cardholders holding an American Express Corporate Platinum Card are automatically enrolled in the MRP. All other Amex Cardholders have the option to enroll in the Membership Program.\n[39] A \u201cDesignated Cardholder\u201d can opt to enroll in the Program for a fee. In the case of the other eligible Cardholders who do not fall into the categories referenced above, they are also required to pay an enrollment fee.\n[40] What stands out from the above in that a person can only become a Member if the person holds an Amex credit card. While one can be an Amex Cardholder without being a Member of the MRP, the inverse is not possible. I agree with the Respondent\u2019s position that this constitutes a direct link between membership in the MRP and the status of a Cardholder.\n[41] Article 5.1 of the MRP Terms and Conditions provides that the MRP and the Points awarded thereunder are for the sole benefit and use of Amex Cardholders.[24]\n[42] This provision establishes another direct link between the MRP and the request of being a Cardholder to enjoy the benefits of the MRP. The same condition is applicable in the case of a Card Member. A Card Member is defined to include a Basic Card Member and the individual Card Member who holds a Corporate Card.\n[43] Article 7 of the MRP Terms and Conditions is of paramount importance. This provision sets out how Members accumulate Points.[25] As is common in loyalty programs, Points are calculated and credited to a Member\u2019s account based on the amount charged to the Member\u2019s Amex Card. This is another important link to the supply of exempt financial services to an Amex Cardholder. It is also a common feature of credit card based loyalty programs and loyalty programs in general.\n[44] Amex derives significant merchant discount revenue from the use of an Amex credit card by its Members. This revenue is directly linked to and varies in accordance with a Cardholder\u2019s use of an Amex credit card to pay for goods and services supplied by a merchant. A merchant that accepts an Amex credit card as a means of payment, assuming that the approval process mandated by Amex is followed, becomes a creditor of Amex. The merchant will receive payment in accordance with the MRP Terms and Conditions of the merchant\u2019s agreement with Amex. As discussed below, the transactions entered into between the merchant and Amex constitute the supply by Amex of financial services to a merchant.\n[45] Contemporaneously, with the acceptance of the Card by a merchant, Amex extends credit to the Cardholder. This is a supply of a financial service. Amex earns gross merchant revenue as a result of the interconnection of both of these transactions. Amex has a debt payable to the merchant. The debt payable to the merchant is an amount equal to the purchase price of the goods or services, less the amount of the agreed upon merchant discount, plus GST\/HST. The merchant discount is given by the merchant as consideration for Amex agreeing to pay for the goods or services acquired by the Member.[26]\n[46] By extending credit to the Cardholder, Amex has a receivable equal to the purchase price of the goods and services acquired by a Member, through the payment means provided by Amex under the MRP Terms and Conditions of the merchant agreement and the MRP Terms and Conditions of the credit card.\n[47] There are multiple components of the supply made by Amex to a Member. The interconnection between the financial supply made by the Member and the accumulation of Points is further illustrated by what happens if the Member returns the purchased goods to a merchant. In this transaction, a refund is granted to an MRP Member by the merchant by crediting the amount of the purchase price of the goods to the Member\u2019s credit card. This in turn results in a decrease in the amount owing by the Member to Amex. Similarly, the merchant\u2019s receivable from Amex is cancelled as a result of the return of the goods. Amex\u2019s entitlement to gross merchant discount revenue is similarly eliminated. As a result of this refund transaction, the Points accumulated as a result of the initial purchase of goods or services are deleted from the Member\u2019s account. It is hard for me to imagine a supply where the different elements and components of a supply are more closely intertwined and linked.\n[48] Mr. Ryan testified that Amex has one of the most desirable loyalty programs that is purposely structured to incentivize Members to use their Amex Card over all other forms of payment that may be available to them. This is done by Amex through its offer of Rewards that are coveted by its Members. A Member can pay for goods and services through a number of means. He or she can use a debit card, a credit card or cash, or use cash obtained by another form of credit. Members choose to pay using their Amex credit card because they receive interest\u2011free credit for the calendar month in which the transaction\u2019s closing date occurred and they receive an additional benefit in the form of Reward Points.[27]\n[49] Merchants accept Amex credit cards because of the financial profile and consumption profile of the Members.\n[50] With this as a backdrop, it is clear to me that Amex incurs the MRP Expenses to increase the volume of credit card transactions. If an MRP Cardholder spends more money by using an MRP credit card, the MRP Cardholder will earn more Points and Amex will earn a greater amount of merchant discount revenue. As a consequence thereof, Amex will incur a Point liability. This Point liability culminates in the purchase by Amex of Rewards as a result of the redemption of Points by a Member.\n[51] The MRP Terms and Conditions pertaining to how Points may be redeemed for Rewards is further evidence of how the Points Reward Expenses are intertwined with the exempt financial services provided by Amex to its Members and merchants. Leaving aside the exceptional cases where additional Points are acquired by a Member to claim a Reward, the Point liability arises when the Member uses an Amex Card. No consideration is paid by the Cardholder for that component of the single supply. That is why many practitioners describe the credit of Points by Amex to a Member\u2019s account as a free supply. I will deal with the impact of the so\u2011called free supply rules provided for in section 141.01 of the ETA, and relied on by the Appellant, later.\n[52] On the basis of the MRP Terms and Conditions, a Member must be in good standing when Points are redeemed. This means that the Member must not be delinquent in his or her obligations under the credit card agreement outlining the MRP Terms and Conditions under which an Amex Card may be used. A Member is barred from redeeming Points if account payments are not made on or before the payment due date. Mr. Ryan explained that this feature was deliberately built into the MRP because it helps to reduce Amex\u2019s exposure to credit default risk.[28] This illustrates once again how the MRP Terms and Conditions pertaining to the redemption of Points for Rewards is an integral part of a composite whole.\n[53] I will now turn to other elements or components of the MRP which the Appellant claims constitute separate taxable supplies. Why do MRP\u2011Extra Cardholders elect to become Members of the MRP and pay an annual nominal fee for doing so? The short answer is that they want to enjoy the benefits of the MRP, the elements of which form an integral part of a composite supply. Electing to become a Member does not have commercial efficacy on its own for the reasons outlined above.\n[54] As I pointed out to the Appellant\u2019s counsel during his oral submission, if the payment of a nominal amount to become a Member constitutes a separate taxable supply that entitles issuers of credit cards to claim ITCs in respect of all of the expenses incurred on elements or components of their loyalty program, I can imagine that credit card issuers would institute a practise similar to that of Amex to achieve a substantial GST\/HST tax savings. It would be easy to do so without additional cost to Cardholders. For example, the fee paid for the right to use the credit card could be lowered and that same amount could be set as the amount charged to become a member of a credit card loyalty program.\n[55] I believe that similar observations can be made regarding Points Accelerator Fees and Point purchase revenue transactions entered into by Amex. These components or elements of the MRP are also closely tied to the obtaining of Rewards by Members. These elements can only be availed of if a Member is in good standing vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis his or her credit card obligations.\n(2) Accounting Treatment of MRP Expenses [56] The accounting treatment of Reward Expenses is based on the commercial reality of the exempt financial service provided to Members as described above. It is discussed in the notes to Amex\u2019s 2012 financial statements as follows:\n2.22.3 Membership rewards\nThe Membership Rewards program allows enrolled cardmembers to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards, including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise.\nIFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs requires the Bank to treat separately the element of the sales transaction that relates to the goods and services received and the element that relates to the issuing of rewards points. The Bank therefore defers revenue equating to the fair value, to the customer, of the Membership Rewards points awarded. This revenue is deferred until such time that the award points are redeemed or expire and the Bank fulfils its obligation to the cardmember to supply Membership Rewards. The remainder of the discount revenue is recognized as the associated transaction occurs which is per the current discount revenue accounting policy.\nThe Bank establishes a deferred revenue liability representing the fair value of points earned to date, that are ultimately expected to be redeemed. Revenue recognized per point redeemed is calculated, on a weighted average basis, separately for distinct reward categories. Management uses models to estimate ultimate redemption rates based on historical redemption statistics, card product type, year of program enrolment, enrolment tenure and card spend levels.\nThe liability for the fair value of Membership Rewards points is included in deferred revenue on the statement of financial position (see note 11).\nThe Bank continually evaluates its reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns.[29]\n[57] The above treatment is based on the so\u2011called matching principle. In short, the matching principle requires that businesses recognize some of the merchant discount revenue at the same time that a deferred expense is finally realized. When the Point liability arises, it is a deferred liability. It is a deferred expense because the actual cash expense arises only when the Points are redeemed by a Member for a Reward or alternatively when the Points are forfeited altogether. Because of this commercial reality, part of the merchant discount revenue must also be deferred. In other words, a portion of the merchant discount revenue must also be deferred (the \u201cDeferred Revenue\u201d) because it has not yet been fully earned. The Deferred Revenue is then recognized and matched to the deferred MRP Expenses as Points are redeemed. The commercial reality of a credit transaction that gives rise to a Deferred Point liability, as illustrated by the accounting transaction in the instant case, demonstrates that the Point Reward Expenses are inextricably linked with the supplies of exempt financial services to both MRP Cardholders and merchants that accept such Cards for payment.\n[58] I pointed out my observations on the above to the Appellant\u2019s counsel prior to his oral submissions. His response was that the test for determining whether supplies are a composite supply or multiple supplies is provided for in the law. Needless to say, I agree with this observation. That said, I believe that the accounting transaction in the instant case is, inter alia, relevant because it is based on the commercial reality of the components or elements of a single composite supply.\n[59] In summary, I conclude that all of the elements and components of the MRP are inherently intertwined and connected with the exempt supply of financial services made by the Appellant to its Members and merchants for the following reasons:\nFirst, a Member can only accumulate Points and obtain Rewards when he or she uses an Amex Card for the purchase of goods and services. The Member must also be in good standing as a Cardholder when Points are collected and redeemed.\nThe accumulation of Points and the obtaining of Rewards is considered by MRP Cardholders to be an additional benefit. The MRP is specifically designed to encourage Members to use their Amex Cards so that Amex can earn greater amounts of merchant discount revenue.\nEnrollment in the MRP by an MRP Cardholder alone offers no benefits in and of itself. Points can only be earned and redeemed for benefits if an Amex Card is used by a Member to pay for goods or services.\nAmex\u2019s Points Reward liability rises and falls in tandem with the amount of credit that it extends to MRP Cardholders. Similarly, the amount of merchant discount revenue earned by Amex rises and falls in tandem with MRP Cardholders\u2019 spending.\nThe evidence shows, for example, that Amex\u2019s credit card revenue was close to $1 billion per year.[30] On the basis of the CRA\u2019s calculation, which was not rebutted by contrary evidence, the revenue from MRP fees represented less than 0.4% of Amex\u2019s total revenue.[31]\n[60] With this backdrop in mind, I conclude that all of the elements or components of the MRP are integrated and intertwined components of a composite supply of exempt financial services made by Amex to MRP Cardholders.\n(3) Determination of the Predominant Elements of the Composite Supply [61] I will now proceed to examine the evidentiary record relevant to the determination of the predominant element of the single composite supply outlined above.\n[62] The parties agree, in large part, on how one goes about determining the predominant element of a single compound supply.\n[63] Briefly, in Global Cash Access (Canada) Inc. v. R, 2013 FCA 269 the Federal Court of Appeal mused as follows on how the definition of a financial service should be applied:\n[26] To determine whether that single supply falls within the statutory definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d, the questions to be asked are these: (1) Based on an interpretation of the contracts between the Casinos and Global, what did the Casinos provide to Global to earn the commissions payable by Global? (2) Does that service fall within the statutory definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d?[32]\n[64] In Great\u2011West Life Assurance Co. v. R, 2016 FCA 316, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that, following Global Cash Access, the first question is \u201csimply to determine what services [are] provided for the consideration received.\u201d[33] This first step identifies services that are also not the predominant elements, while the second step of the analysis requires:\n[48] . . . a determination as to whether the supply is included in the definition of \u201cfinancial service.\u201d As part of this exercise, it is necessary to determine the predominant elements of the supply if it is a single compound supply. It is only the predominant elements that are taken into account in applying the inclusions and exclusions in the \u201cfinancial service\u201d definition.[34]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[65] Therefore, what is clear from the case law is that the identification of the predominant elements of a single compound supply is based on a two\u2011step test. First, I am required to identify all of the components of the supplies that were received by the MRP Cardholder. At the second stage, I must then determine the predominant elements of the supply made by Amex to MRP Cardholders because it is a single compound supply.[35]\n[66] As noted earlier, in determining the essence or nature of the supply, the parties agree that the law requires one to take into account the perspective of the recipient of the supply.\n[67] The relevant question is as follows: What did the MRP Cardholders receive under the key agreements? The following is a summary of the elements and components of the composite supply:\n1. Right to enroll in the MRP granted to MRP-Extra Cardholders in consideration of a nominal fee and a nominal annual renewal fee;\n2. Right to be credited with a higher ratio of Points per dollar charged in consideration of a Points Accelerator Fee;\n3. Accumulation of Points based on credit card spending;\n4. The extension of credit to an MRP Cardholder upon use of a card;\n5. Payment for the goods and services purchased with the cards;\n6. Right to purchase additional Points;\n7. Granting of a Reward on a redemption of Points.\n[68] In my opinion, all of the facts considered above and relied on by me to determine that all of the elements and components of the MRP are elements of a composite supply also establish that the predominant element of that supply is the extension of credit by Amex to a Member.\n[69] The above becomes obvious when the value of the Points accumulated by a Cardholder is compared to the value of the goods and services purchased by a Member and charged to his or her account. Mr. Ryan, in his testimony, referred to the accumulated Points as an additional benefit. The value of the accumulated Points is calculated by reference to the amounts of the goods and services purchased, and while the value of the Points may be worth more than points offered by Amex\u2019s competitors under competing loyalty programs, the Points accumulated by a Member represent a small fraction of the amount of credit extended to a Member. The commercial efficacy of the supply, from the Cardholder\u2019s perspective, is credit which is interest\u2011free (provided the full amount of the monthly bill is paid on time) that allows the MRP Cardholder to procure goods and services without using cash savings or borrowing funds from a different source.\n[70] As noted above, Amex provides two interconnected exempt supplies of financial services in connection with its credit card business involving Members. Before an MRP Cardholder can charge goods and services to an Amex Card, Amex must recruit merchants and arrange for the merchants to accept Amex Cards as payment for purchased goods and services. The service that is arranged for falls within the definition of a financial service.\n[71] Why do merchants compensate Amex by paying a merchant discount? In my opinion, they do so because it allows merchants to maximize their sales by agreeing to enter into a transaction that allows their potential customers to receive credit. In the case of higher\u2011priced goods, such as electronic goods, appliances, furniture and automobiles, this is a common practice. Those goods are often offered for sale with attractive terms of payment. The cost associated by the merchant, including credit risk, is built into the costs of goods sold and, generally speaking, is shared by all customers, including those who pay cash. It is common knowledge that merchants often refuse to discount the purchase price for those who pay cash. In summary, merchants agree to pay merchant discounts to increase sales and avoid other financing costs. That is the commercial efficacy of the supply made by Amex to merchants.\n[72] The Appellant argued that one of the elements of the supply for merchants that are Participants is the marketing and promotion of the products and services offered by Participants as Rewards. I will deal more fully with this point later in my analysis of the Appellant\u2019s submissions regarding the application of section 141.01. Suffice to say, Members seek goods from merchants for a variety of reasons. They are attached to a merchant brand which is promoted by the merchant itself through various types of advertising.\n[73] Both of the parties marshaled a number of cases that they claim support their position.[36] While these cases are important, the outcome is inherently fact\u2013driven. The results turn on the particular facts and it is therefore unnecessary to comment on these particular cases at length.\n[74] Subsection 169(1) does not apply because the expenses are not incurred or made in the course of a commercial activity.\n[75] The Crown has raised a number of reasons why the Appellant is not entitled to claim an NITC in respect of the redemption price paid for Travel Certificates. Of particular importance is the requirement that the redemption expense be incurred in the course of a commercial activity of the payor. As noted in President\u2019s Choice Bank v. The Queen, 2022 TCC 844, the words \u201cin the course of\u201d have a wide meaning to make ITCs available if the item directly or indirectly contributes to the production of articles or the provision of services that are taxable.[37] Further, the definition of \u201ccommercial activity\u201d requires that where there are multiple businesses or business objectives, any part of the business that consists of making exempt supplies must be notionally severed.[38] Notwithstanding this, it is clear to me that the redemption expense is incurred in respect of a liability that arose because of the supply of an exempt financial service. Therefore, for the reasons that I annunciated in PC Bank, this precondition is not satisfied as a result. I do not have to comment on the other conditions.\n[76] In conclusion, I am of the opinion that in the case of the composite supplies made by Amex, the predominant elements or components of the supply are exempt financial services.\n[77] In the alternative, the Respondent submitted that sections 138 and 139 of the ETA apply. These provisions are narrower in scope to the tests applied by me above. For section 138 to apply, there must be a single consideration for the supply and one must be incidental to the other. Having decided that the nature of the composite supply is that of an exempt financial service, I do not have to consider the Respondent\u2019s alternate argument.\n[78] The Respondent also relied, in the alternative, on section 139 of the ETA. This provision is not of general application. The effect of section 139, when the preconditions of that provision are satisfied, is that a taxable supply is deemed to be financial. Likewise, I do not have to consider this issue for the same reasons as stated immediately above.\n[79] Finally, the Appellant argued in the alternative that the supply of Rewards under the MRP was excluded from the definition of a financial service by virtue of the exclusion to the definition specified in paragraph (r.5). Suffice to say on this point that the provision of a Reward is an element or component of a composite supply, and that component of the supply is not a predominant element thereof. The inclusions and exclusions in the definition of a financial service are applied in the case of a composite supply by reference to the predominant element of the supply.\n(4) Free Supplies of Rewards [80] The Respondent submits that the so\u2011called free supply rule provided for in subsection 141.01(4) applies to characterize the supply of Rewards as a taxable supply. For that reason, the Appellant claims that it is entitled to ITCs in respect of its MRP Expenses. The parts of section 141.01 relevant to my analysis of the Appellant\u2019s submission on this issue are reproduced below for ease of reference:[39]\nMeaning of endeavour\n141.01(1) In this section, endeavour of a person means\n(a) a business of the person;\n(b) an adventure or concern in the nature of trade of the person; or\n(c) the making of a supply by the person of real property of the person, including anything done by the person in the course of or in connection with the making of the supply.\n. . .\nAcquisition for purpose of making supplies\n(2) Where a person acquires or imports property or a service or brings it into a participating province for consumption or use in the course of an endeavour of the person, the personal shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to have acquired or imported the property or service or brought it into the province, as the case may be,\n(a) for consumption or use in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the property or service is acquired, imported or brought into the province by the person for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration in the course of that endeavour; and\n(b) for consumption or use otherwise than in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the property or service is acquired, imported or brought into the province by the person\n(i) for the purpose of making supplies in the course of that endeavour that are not taxable supplies made for consideration, or\n(ii) for a purpose other than the making of supplies in the course of that endeavour.\nUse for purpose of making supplies\n(3) Where a person consumes or uses property or a service in the course of an endeavour of the person, that consumption or use shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to be\n(a) in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the consumption or use is for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration in the course of that endeavour; and\n(b) otherwise than in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the consumption or use is\n(i) for the purpose of making supplies in the course of that endeavour that are not taxable supplies made for consideration, or\n(ii) for a purpose other than the making of supplies in the course of that endeavour.\nFree supplies\n(4) Where\n(a) a supplier makes a taxable supply (in this subsection referred to as a \u201cfree supply\u201d) of property or a service for no consideration or nominal consideration in the course of a particular endeavour of the supplier, and\n(b) it can reasonably be regarded that among the purposes (in this subsection referred to as the \u201cspecified purposes\u201d) for which the free supply is made is the purpose of facilitating, furthering or promoting\n(i) the acquisition, consumption or use of other property or services by any other person, or\n(ii) an endeavour of any person,\nthe following rules apply:\n(c) to the extent that the supplier acquired or imported a particular property or service or brought it into a participating province for the purpose of making the free supply of that property or service or for consumption or use in the course of making the free supply, the supplier shall be deemed, for the purposes of subsection (2), to have acquired or imported the particular property or service or brought it into the province, as the case may be,\n(i) for use in the course of the particular endeavour, and\n(ii) for the specified purposes and not for the purpose of making the free supply, and\n(d) to the extent that the supplier consumed or used a particular property or service for the purpose of making the free supply, the supplier shall be deemed, for the purposes of subsection (3), to have consumed or used the particular property or service for the specified purposes and not for the purpose of making the free supply.\n[81] In the context of the MRP, the Appellant claims that the supply of Rewards to Members is made for no consideration. Therefore, it satisfies the free supply pre\u2011condition set out in that provision. The Appellant makes this claim without elaborating on how it reached this conclusion. If a free supply exists, it is the accumulation of Points in the first instance. The next element of or component of the composite supply is the supply of a Reward by Amex in satisfaction of a redemption liability that is extinguished on completion of the transaction. The satisfaction of a bona fide liability, in my opinion, constitutes consideration for the Reward.\n[82] I am of the view that the Appellant is not making a free supply in the context of the overall financial service supplies that it makes to both Members and merchants as discussed above. The Appellant incurs the Reward Expense for the purpose of earning greater merchant discount revenue in its credit card business. Substantially all of the revenue that it earns is merchant discount revenue and interest from its credit card receivables. There is a direct link between the MRP Expenses and the merchant discount revenue that arises because of credit extended to a Member. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the direct link between the merchant discount revenue is the reason why part of this revenue must be deferred and recognized when the Reward Expense is actually realized.\n[83] The Appellant anticipated that I would look at the single supply transaction as a whole to determine whether or not a taxable supply was made for no consideration. The Appellant argues that I must determine whether or not the free supply rule applies by considering the supply of the Reward as a separate transaction. This is what the Appellant says on this point:\nApplying the foregoing in the context of the MRP, where the Rewards are acquired for consumption or use for the purpose of supplying them to Members who redeem for the Rewards (the first\u2011order supply), it is the tax status of that first\u2011order supply (i.e., the supply of the Rewards to Members for no consideration) that determines whether the inputs (namely the Participant GST) was incurred for consumption or use in a commercial activity. The issue of whether the ultimate purposes is to earn discount revenue is not relevant to this analysis.[40]\n[84] The approach suggested by the Appellant is contrary to the scheme of how ITCs are awarded or not under the ETA. First, it is well established that whether or not the ITCs can be claimed depends on the nature of the supply for which they are used or the purpose thereof. If, as determined above, expenses are incurred for expenses related to inputs to a composite supply that is a financial service, the ETA provides that no ITCs may be claimed. The tax is borne by the supplier, rather than the recipient of the supply. The reason for this is that there is no GST\/HST payable by the recipient of an exempt supply. In the case of a composite supply, it is further well established that the nature of the supply is determined by reference to the predominant elements of the supply. Thus, the analytical approach that the Appellant recommends that I adopt stands in stark contradiction to the aforementioned principles.\n[85] The Appellant\u2019s analytical approach also results in a supply that escapes taxation altogether. Under the ETA, only zero\u2011rated supplies and the inputs thereto are not subject to tax.\n[86] If I am wrong on this first point, I am also of the view that the pre\u2011condition set out in paragraph 141.01(4)(b) does not apply. This provision requires the following pre\u2011conditions to be satisfied:\nIt can reasonably be regarded (the \u201cReasonability Test\u201d) that among the purposes for which the supply is made is the purpose of facilitating, furthering or promoting\na) the acquisition, consumption or use of services by any person, or\nb) an endeavour of any person.\n[87] The Appellant claims that the purpose of the free supply is to promote the activities of Participants.\n[88] I do not share this view for the reasons referenced earlier.\n[89] Considering the evidence as a whole surrounding why and how the Point Reward Expenses are incurred, I do not share the Appellant\u2019s view that it can reasonably be regarded that one of the purposes of the Rewards is to promote the activities of Participants, for the reasons noted earlier.[41] The promotional and marketing of Rewards by Amex is carried out for its own purpose.\n[90] Finally, if I am wrong on both points, I am still of the view that the Appellant is not entitled to claim ITCs in respect of its MRP Expenses because of the language used in paragraph 141.01(4)(c) of the ETA. The introductory words in that provision are \u201cto the extent . . . for the specified purposes\u201d. The specified purpose which the Appellant has based its submissions on is the alleged promotion of the Participants\u2019 activities. The words \u201cto the extent of\u201d require that an allocation be made. The Appellant has led no evidence of how the MRP Expenses are to be allocated between: (1) the purpose of promoting Participant activities, which I disagree is a purpose, and (2) the significant and overwhelming purpose of the composite supply of a financial service, referenced above.\n[91] On this point, the Appellant says that the Respondent has not challenged the manner in which it initially allocated MRP Expenses. The methodology used by the Appellant was based on the percentage of MRP\u2011Extra Cards held by Members to total Cards held by Members. This methodology has nothing to do with the promotion of the Participants\u2019 activities. The Appellant defends its ITC claim alternatively on the application of subsection 141.01(4). It claims that the Minister\u2019s assessments are wrong for this reason. The burden of establishing the facts that demonstrate that all of the pre\u2013conditions of that provision have been satisfied resides with the Appellant and not the Respondent.\nV. Final Observations\n[92] It is an understatement for me to say that the Appellant\u2019s position in this matter is akin to the task of swimming against a significant riptide. I pointed out to the Appellant that if I agreed with its position, this would lead to a result which is contrary to the outcome of a number of decisions involving taxpayers that sought to grow the revenue from their credit card business by offering rewards to members of their loyalty programs calculated based on their card spending. I considered a similar series of facts in my recent decision in PC Bank. PC Bank had the right to issue PC Bank points to cardholders whenever they used their PC MasterCards. PC Bank claimed NITCs pursuant to subsection 181(5) for payments it made to Loblaw when PC MasterCard holders redeemed points at Loblaw stores. This is similar to the treatment sought by Amex when Travel Certificates issued for Points are redeemed for travel arranged by ACI franchisees. My factual findings in the PC Bank case are quite similar to my factual findings in the instant case. In the PC Bank case, I determined that the redemption payments were linked to the making of exempt supplies of financial services by PC Bank. As a result, PC Bank was not entitled to an NITC because the redemption payments were not made in the course of a commercial activity.\n[93] As the Respondent pointed out in his written submissions,[42] both this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal observed that under the general scheme of the ETA, a financial institution cannot claim ITCs for any GST\/HST in connection with a loyalty program where those inputs are used in the carrying out of a financial services business.\n[94] The Appellant claims that the facts in the present case are very different than the facts considered in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v The Queen, 2019 TCC 79, aff\u2019d 2021 FCA 96.[43] In the present case, Amex operates its own loyalty program; the CIBC did not. CIBC paid for the right to issue Aeroplan points to its cardholders who were or became Aeroplan loyalty members. I noted to counsel for the Appellant that Amex does almost the very same thing as CIBC does in connection with its relationship with Aeroplan. Amex has a right which is similar in effect to that enjoyed by CIBC. CIBC is allowed to issue points to holders of its Aeroplan credit card. They pay for the points which are, for all intents and purposes, allocated as rewards to its cardholders. Similarly, in the instant case, Amex has the right to cause Aeroplan to issue Aeroplan points for the Amex Points that its Members choose to convert on a one\u2013for\u2013one basis. Amex makes a payment to Aeroplan for the Points that Aeroplan issues on the conversion transaction. This conversion transaction places the MRP Member in the same position as the CIBC client who receives Aeroplan points paid for by CIBC in the first place. In both of these cases, the taxpayer points can be redeemed for rewards paid for by Aeroplan. Once the points are issued by Aeroplan, Aeroplan takes on the deferred point liability. As soon as the Aeroplan points are issued, both CIBC and Amex are released of any further obligation regarding the redemption of the Aeroplan points.\nVI. Conclusion\n[95] Considering all of the above, the Appellant is not entitled to claim ITCs paid in connection with its MRP Expenses. Similarly, the Appellant is not entitled to the NITCs claimed for the Travel Certificate Payments made to ACI franchisees.\n[96] The Appellant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 27th day of June 2023.\n\u201cRobert J.

Elijay\nJanuary 1, 2018 to October 30, 2019\nRobert Pagdilao\nAugust 1, 2018 to October 25, 2018\nI. Overview\n[2] The Appellant contends that the cleaners were independent contractors during the relevant periods and, for that reason, it was not required to withhold and remit any amounts under the CPP and EI Act. The Crown disagrees, contending that the Appellant was required to withhold and remit amounts under the CPP and EI Act in respect of all eight of its employees.\n[3] Evidence was given by one of the Appellant\u2019s two shareholders, Ms. Biralde, and from two of the cleaners. As the evidence did not disclose any meeting of the minds between the Appellant and the cleaners with respect to their status, I relied primarily on objective factors. On a balance of probabilities, those factors lead me to conclude that all eight cleaners were independent contractors rather than employees.\n[4] The decisive factors are that the cleaners could come and go as they pleased and, more importantly, could enlist helpers and even provide replacements, all without the Appellant\u2019s approval. Training was rather perfunctory and supervision relatively light. The picture provided by the entirety of the evidence is more consistent with the cleaners as independent contractors than it is with the cleaners as employees.\nII. Law [5] As the Federal Court of Appeal explained in 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) v MNR, the subjective intent of each party to the relationship is the first factor to be determined.[1] After that has been done, the objective factors are considered. In Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v MNR, the Federal Court of Appeal set out the following objective factors that help distinguish between independent contractors and employees:\n(1) control;\n(2) ownership of the tools;\n(3) chance of profit; and\n(4) risk of loss.[2]\n[6] No single factor predominates and no mechanical formula is to be applied. In his recent decision in 0808498 BC Ltd. v MNR, Justice Sommerfeldt offered a useful summary of the factors to be considered in making this determination:\na) Does the hirer control the worker\u2019s activities?\nb) Does the hirer provide the tools and equipment required by the worker, or is the worker required to provide his or her own tools and equipment?\nc) Does the worker hire his or her own helpers?\nd) What is the degree of financial risk taken by the worker? In other words, does the worker have a risk of loss?\ne) What is the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker?\nf) Does the worker have an opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks?[3]\nIII. Facts and Analysis\n[7] Ms. Marilyn Biralde and her husband, Mr. Antonio Biralde, incorporated the Appellant as a British Columbia corporation in 2017 as its sole shareholders. The Appellant\u2019s business is providing janitorial services to hotels, movie theatres, and office buildings. The only sites referred to in the evidence were the Fairmont Hotel in downtown Vancouver (the \u201cFairmont Hotel\u201d) and the Cineplex Cinemas in Coquitlam (the \u201cCineplex Cinemas\u201d).\n[8] The Appellant had no contractual relationship with the Fairmont Hotel or the Cineplex Cinemas. It did have an oral agreement, however, with Tricom Building Maintenance (\u201cTricom\u201d) to clean the Cineplex Cinemas and certain common areas of the Fairmont Hotel. All of the Appellant\u2019s cleaning took place at night after those areas were closed to the public and to staff.\n[9] An employee of Tricom took Mr. and Ms. Biralde to each of the sites to show them the tasks the Appellant was to perform. Tricom paid the Appellant a flat fee to clean each work site. Under its oral agreement with Tricom, the Appellant was entitled to subcontract its work to others. Tricom did not require security clearance or any form of background check for the Appellant\u2019s cleaners. Tricom did not have any rules about who could or could not accompany the Appellant\u2019s cleaners to the work sites.\n[10] If the Fairmont Hotel or the Cineplex Cinemas had any complaints about cleaning deficiencies, they would let Tricom know. If there were any such deficiencies, Tricom imposed no financial penalties on the Appellant. Similarly, the Appellant did not impose any financial penalty on the cleaners if there were any such deficiencies.\n[11] The Appellant hired the cleaners through referrals and job postings. The Appellant had no written agreement with any of the cleaners. Each cleaner was hired to clean a specific location and each cleaner had a full-time day job.\n[12] I will deal first with the six cleaners who did not testify. I will then turn to the two cleaners who gave evidence at the hearing.\nSix cleaners who did not testify\nSubjective intention [13] Ms. Biralde\u2019s testimony makes it clear that the Appellant intended that the cleaners be independent contractors. But in the absence of any written agreement, or evidence from the six cleaners who did not give evidence, no conclusions can be drawn about their subjective intention.\nObjective factors Level of control [14] Although the Appellant required the cleaners to wear a uniform bearing the Tricom name, the preponderance of the other evidence suggests that the other six cleaners were independent contractors:\nThe cleaners could decide when to begin their work each night following closing time of the Fairmont Hotel kitchens or the Cineplex Cinemas and they could return home as soon as they finished their work. Generally, they worked for as long as it took to complete their cleaning between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Their work would generally take anywhere from three to five hours. Neither Mr. Biralde nor Ms. Biralde had to be at any particular site in order to let the cleaners in as the cleaners had their own keys. The Appellant did not check how many hours the cleaners spent at the work sites and did not require them to submit timesheets.\nAlthough the Appellant explained to the cleaners which tasks were priorities, the Appellant provided them with virtually no training.\nThe cleaners were not subject to any corporate policies (except for the Tricom uniform).\n[15] Mr. Biralde and Ms. Biralde were often at the work sites doing their own cleaning. While they were there, they would check the work done by the cleaners. The Biraldes did not evaluate the work done by each cleaner at the end of each night using a checklist. If they were not satisfied with the work done, they did not ask the cleaner to redo the work. Presumably, they did whatever additional cleaning was necessary themselves.\n[16] The effect of the Biraldes checking the work of the cleaners while on site doing their own cleaning should not be overstated. As Justice Pizzitelli noted in 3142774 Nova Scotia Limited v MNR:\n[26] In City Water International Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2006 FCA 350\u2026 the Federal Court of Appeal, citing its earlier decision delivered by L\u00e9tourneau J.A. in Livreur Plus Inc. c. Ministre du Revenu national, 2004 FCA 68\u2026 confirmed in paragraph 18 that \"the Court should not confuse control over the result or quality of the work with control over its performance by the worker responsible for doing it\" and that \"Monitoring the result must not be confused with controlling the worker\".[4]\n[emphasis added]\n[17] In City Water International Inc. v MNR, the Federal Court of Appeal held that \u201ccontrolling the quality of work is not the same as controlling its performance by the worker hired to do it\u201d.[5]\nTools and supplies [18] Tricom would supply all tools, supplies, and equipment including mops, vacuums, and cleaning supplies. Tricom also provided uniforms bearing its name. Tricom was responsible for maintaining the equipment. Neither Tricom nor the Appellant charged the cleaners to use any of it. This is a neutral factor.[6]\nChance of profit\/risk of loss [19] The Appellant paid each cleaner a flat fee each month. The amount of the fee depended on the size of the area the cleaner was responsible for cleaning. The cleaners were free to bring helpers who were typically spouses, friends, or other family members. They could hire anyone they liked to assist them. They could even hire a replacement for their entire contract. All of this could be done without the Appellant\u2019s approval.\n[20] If a cleaner was unavailable on any particular night, they could send someone else to do the work. If a cleaner was sick, they were expected to find a replacement. The Appellant would not pay a fee to the replacement but would continue to pay the cleaner directly regardless of whether someone filled in for them. If the cleaner could not find a replacement, the Biraldes would find someone themselves and adjust the cleaner\u2019s fee accordingly.\n[21] In Victoria\u2019s Five Star Cleaning v MNR, Justice Lafleur concluded that certain cleaners had the opportunity to make a profit as they were able to hire their own helpers:\n[66] As argued by the Appellant, I agree that the Workers had the opportunity to make a profit because they could hire workers and find ways to make their work more efficient and risked loss if they could not complete the work themselves or could not secure performance of the task by someone else at a lower cost. The evidence showed that the Workers were paid a flat monthly rate for their services and the evidence also showed that the Workers were allowed to hire helpers and did not have to perform the services personally. ...[7]\n[22] Similarly, in Stanton v MNR, Justice D\u2019Arcy concluded that a worker who was paid a flat rate could increase their profit by completing the work more efficiently by using helpers.[8] As in Victoria\u2019s Five Star Cleaning and Stanton, there was a chance of profit and a risk of loss.\n[23] Most of the objective factors suggest that the other six cleaners were independent contractors.\nMr. John Paul Morales\n[24] Mr. Morales had a full-time day job as a school custodian. He also worked for the Appellant from August 2018 to October 2019. The Appellant decided to retain Mr. Morales after Mr. Biralde and Mr. Morales visited the Cineplex Cinemas together. During that visit, Mr. Biralde showed Mr. Morales what had to be done.\nSubjective intention [25] Ms. Biralde\u2019s testimony makes it clear that the Appellant intended that the cleaners be independent contractors. Mr. Morales did not consider the question when he entered into his oral agreement with the Appellant to clean the Cineplex Cinemas. His understanding of his oral agreement with the Appellant was simply: \u201cjust to do the job\u201d.[9]\nObjective factors Level of control [26] Mr. Biralde gave Mr. Morales the key to the premises so he could clean the Cineplex Cinemas and come and go as he pleased. He received no training from the Appellant. On his first day of work, he was shown the areas to be cleaned and which areas to prioritize. Mr. Morales did not have set hours, but would generally start his work around 9:00 p.m. each night. He was free to leave as soon as he finished.\n[27] Mr. Morales testified that Mr. Biralde would arrive at the Cineplex Cinemas toward the end of Mr. Morales\u2019 shift to do his own cleaning and, while there, would check Mr. Morales\u2019 work. When he was on site, Mr. Biralde might ask him to re-do some of it. Mr. Biralde did not check Mr. Morales\u2019 work every night but would check it about three times a week. As I have already noted, the effect of this type of checking should not be overstated.\n[28] Mr. Morales was not required to keep a record of his hours or send the Appellant timesheets. He was not aware of any corporate policies of the Appellant in general or any disciplinary policies in particular.\nTools and supplies [29] Mr. Morales used a backpack vacuum, an auto-scrubber machine, a mop and mop wringer, and a Walkman. Mr. Morales believed that the Appellant had provided the tools and supplies and was responsible for fixing them. Mr. Morales did not provide his own tools or cleaning supplies. The only expenses incurred by Mr. Morales related to the car he drove to work.\n[30] But Ms. Biralde had testified that it was Tricom \u2013 and not the Appellant \u2013 that provided the equipment and that Tricom was responsible for its maintenance. As Mr. Morales interacted only with the Biraldes, and not with Tricom, one can understand why he believed that the Appellant provided and maintained the tools and supplies. This factor is neutral.\nChance of profit\/risk of loss [31] Mr. Morales received a flat fee each month from the Appellant. Although he did not hire any helpers, he understood that he was free to do so. In addition, he understood that he was not required to do the work personally but could hire someone else to do it. If Mr. Morales was sick, he would call Mr. Biralde whom he assumed would find a replacement.\n[32] Balancing each factor, and giving each its appropriate weight, I conclude that Mr. Morales was an independent contractor.\nMr. Marlon Camposagrado\n[33] Mr. Camposagrado\u2019s full-time day job was at a local airport. After being introduced to the Biraldes by a co-worker, Mr. Camposagrado began working for the Appellant cleaning two kitchens at the Fairmont Hotel.\nSubjective intention [34] Ms. Biralde\u2019s testimony makes it clear that the Appellant intended that the cleaners be independent contractors. Mr. Camposagrado testified that when he agreed to work for the Appellant, he did not believe he was running his own business. But when asked if he had ever run his own business before, Mr. Camposagrado replied \u201cno, only this one\u201d.[10] Mr. Camposagrado obtained a business license from the City of Vancouver and named his business \u201cGMC Cleaning\u201d.\nObjective factors Level of control [35] Mr. Camposagrado received no training from Mr. Biralde other than his first night cleaning the Fairmont Hotel kitchens. That first night training consisted of nothing more than Mr. Biralde showing him the basics and which tasks were priorities. He was asked to wear a black shirt and black pants while doing his work.\n[36] Generally, Mr. Camposagrado would clean the kitchens from 11:00 p.m. until 4:00 a.m. He would leave as soon as his work was finished and was free to run errands or grab a bite whenever he wished, though he testified that he never took advantage of the opportunity. Mr. Camposagrado was not required to keep a record of his hours.\n[37] Mr. Biralde was also at the Fairmont Hotel most nights doing his own cleaning. He would check Mr. Camposagrado\u2019s work when he was on site. Ms. Biralde was sometimes there too. Mr. Biralde would check to see whether the kitchens needed any additional cleaning. If the Fairmont Hotel had a complaint about the cleaning, it would tell Mr. Biralde who would pass it along to Mr. Camposagrado. Mr. Camposagrado would address the issue the following night. Mr. Camposagrado was not aware of any corporate policies of the Appellant in general or of any disciplinary policies in particular.\nTools and supplies [38] Mr. Camposagrado believed that either the Appellant or Tricom provided the tools and supplies he used, including a degreaser and a mop. If anything needed repair, he would speak to Mr. Biralde. The only items Mr. Camposagrado purchased himself were the black shirt and black pants he was required to wear while working. He was also asked to wear a Tricom uniform from time to time. This factor is neutral.\nChance of profit\/risk of loss [39] Mr. Camposagrado was paid $4,500 per month. He was free to hire his own helpers. He brought his wife to help him every once in a while when she had free time. He asked Mr. Biralde about this, and was told there was no problem. Mr. Camposagrado understood that his wife could clean in his stead. He did not pay his wife when she helped him. A friend of Mr. Camposagrado would also help him clean every so often. Mr. Camposagrado did not pay the friend because he provided the friend with free room and board. If Mr. Camposagrado was sick or away, he would let Mr. Biralde know and was not required to find his own replacement.\n[40] Balancing each factor, and giving each its appropriate weight, I conclude that Mr. Camposagrado was an independent contractor.\nIV. Conclusion [41] The Appellant has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that none of the cleaners was engaged in pensionable employment under the CPP or insurable employment under the EI Act during the relevant periods. The fact that the cleaners could come and go as they pleased and, most importantly, could use their own helpers or replacements without the Appellant\u2019s approval tilt the balance in favour of the conclusion that the cleaners were independent contractors.\n[42] For all of these reasons the appeals will be allowed, without costs.\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated July 4, 2023.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 17th day of July 2023.\n\u201cDavid E.

The reassessments are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that, for each reporting period of the Appellant ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2011, the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits are to be determined by applying the Appellant\u2019s Final Percentage of 24.52% to the total amount of HST that was paid or payable by the Appellant in the specific period, and for each reporting period of the Appellant ending between April 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012, the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits are to be determined by applying the Appellant\u2019s Final Percentage of 18.11% to the total amount of HST that was paid or payable by the Appellant in the specific period. Such input tax credits shall be used to calculate the Appellant\u2019s net tax for each of the relevant periods and its entitlement to the public service body rebate under section 259 of the GST Act.\nThe parties have 60 days from the date of this judgment to make written representations with respect to the amount of costs that the Court should award the Appellant. The written submissions shall not exceed 15 pages. If no submissions are received, costs shall be awarded to the Appellant as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Antigonish, Nova Scotia, this 10th day of July 2023.\n\u201cS. D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2023TCC95\nDate: 20230710\nDockets: 2012-1765(GST)G\n2015-2123(GST)G\nBETWEEN:\nMARINE ATLANTIC INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS M AJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\n[1] The issue in the two appeals before the Court is the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to input tax credits with respect to the GST\/HST that it paid on goods and services that it acquired in the course of its business of providing a ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The amount at issue in the two appeals is substantial, in excess of $7 million.\n[2] In the first appeal (the \u201cFirst Appeal\u201d), the Appellant appeals assessments in respect of its GST\/HST reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010. In the second appeal (the \u201cSecond Appeal\u201d), the Appellant appeals assessments in respect of its GST\/HST reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and January 31, 2012. The Court heard the two appeals together on common evidence.\n[3] My former colleague Justice D\u2019Auray was the presiding judge during the hearing of the evidence and the closing argument. However, she retired from the Court in early 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the hearing.\n[4] During a conference call on March 30, 2022, the Chief Justice informed the parties that he would have to assign a new judge to render the judgment in these appeals. He provided the parties with the following two options:\n-a new trial with a new judge; or\n-a new judge who would render a judgment based upon the trial record.\n[5] On the same day, the parties wrote to the Court requesting that it assign a new judge to decide the appeals based on the existing record before the Court.\n[6] I was then appointed the presiding judge for these appeals. After a thorough review of the record, including the transcripts of all proceedings, the various written submissions filed by the parties both with respect to argument and procedural issues, and the substantial documentary evidence, I informed the parties that I would require them to appear before the Court to summarize their argument and answer numerous questions. The parties appeared before me on February 27, 2023 (the \u201cFebruary 2023 Proceedings\u201d).\n[7] During the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the Appellant called two witnesses: Mr. Murray Hupman and Mr. Shawn Leamon.\n[8] Mr. Hupman, a professional engineer, has been with the Appellant for 22 years. Since April 2019, he has served as the president and CEO of the Appellant. Prior to assuming his current position, he held various other positions with the Appellant, including vice-president of operations and chief information officer.\n[9] Mr. Leamon, a CGA\/CPA, has served as the vice-president, finance of the Appellant for the last 15 years, including the years at issue in these appeals. He first worked for the Appellant in 1989 as a summer student.\n[10] Counsel for the Respondent noted at the commencement of the hearing that she did not intend to call any witnesses. However, she intended to file an affidavit. I will discuss the filing of the affidavit shortly.\n[11] Because of issues with respect to the filing of the Respondent\u2019s affidavit, the Respondent called Mr. Bryan Roach. Mr. Roach is currently retired but worked for the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) between March 1992 and October 2012. He did not participate in the GST audit of the Appellant that resulted in the assessments that are before the Court. However, he did conduct a GST audit of the Appellant in the early 2000s that included an audit of excise tax refunds claimed by the Appellant in respect of fuel for the period ending December 31, 2001. As I will discuss, his testimony related solely to these excise tax refunds, Mr. Roach provided no evidence with respect to the periods at issue.\n[12] At the commencement of Mr. Roach\u2019s testimony, counsel for the Respondent asked Mr. Roach the following question: \u201cOther than your general recollection of attending at MAI\u2019s [the Appellant\u2019s] offices and having an interview on the topic of the excise tax refund claims made by MAI for hoteling, do you have any independent recollection of who you talked to, what they told you, or anything of that sort?\u201d Mr. Roach answered, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d[1]\n[13] Counsel for the Respondent then argued that Mr. Roach\u2019s working paper dated November 27, 2002 (which had previously been marked as Exhibit A\u20113 and which I will refer to as the 2002 excise tax audit working paper) should be accepted by the Court under what she referred to as the \u201cpast recollection accorded\u201d concept. The working paper is a document that is barely over a page in length.\n[14] Counsel for the Appellant stated that she had no objection to the Court accepting the 2002 excise tax audit working paper.\n[15] The Respondent was clearly invoking the past recollection recorded doctrine. This doctrine permits witnesses who demonstrate an inability to recall \u201ccertain events\u201d, to use documents, such as the 2002 excise tax audit working paper, in Court in order to assist them while giving testimony, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:\n-The past recollection must have been recorded in some reliable way.\n-At the time that the witness made or reviewed the record, his or her memory must have been sufficiently fresh and vivid to be probably accurate.\n-The witness must be able now to assert that the record accurately represented his or her knowledge and recollection at the time that he or she reviewed it.\n-The original record itself must be used, if it is procurable.[2]\n[16] Counsel for the Respondent then put the 2002 excise tax audit working paper in front of Mr. Roach and asked him a number of leading questions with respect to the working paper. On the basis of Mr. Roach\u2019s answers to counsel for the Respondent\u2019s leading questions (his answers were mainly \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct\u201d, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t directly recall\u201d and \u201c[Y]es, I think in this case that\u2019s what I would have been told\u201d,) it is clear that the working paper was not being used to refresh Mr. Roach\u2019s memory; he had no recollection of the events referred to in his working paper.\n[17] As a result, I have treated the 2002 excise tax audit working paper as a record admitted by the Court under the past recollection recorded doctrine.\n[18] Since the working papers did not refresh Mr. Roach\u2019s memory, it is the 2002 excise tax audit working paper, not Mr. Roach\u2019s testimony, that is the source of the information before the Court.\n[19] The Respondent appears to be relying on the 2002 excise tax audit working paper as evidence of purported discussions between Mr. Roach and a Mr. David Penney, who in 2002 was a staff accountant for the Appellant. This evidence is hearsay evidence. I have given no weight to the references in the 2002 excise tax audit working paper to such discussions, especially since a number of factual conclusions made by Mr. Roach in the working paper were shown by the Appellant\u2019s witnesses to be incorrect. If the Respondent wanted evidence before the Court with respect to Mr. Penney\u2019s purported comments, he should have called Mr. Penney.\n[20] In addition, the 2002 excise tax audit working paper arose with respect to an audit that occurred years before the period at issue and related to excise tax on fuel, not to GST. Such evidence has little or no value in the appeals before the Court.\n[21] To the extent that the Appellant\u2019s claiming of excise tax refunds with respect to fuel during the periods at issue is relevant, I have relied on the testimony of Mr. Leamon as opposed to a one-page document. Mr. Leamon informed himself of why the Appellant claimed the excise tax refunds during the periods at issue in these appeals and how it calculated the refunds during such periods.\n[22] The parties also filed a Partially Agreed Statement of Facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d) as well as a Joint Book of Documents composed of seven volumes of documents. Although this was not indicated at the time that the books were filed with the Court, the parties stated during the February 2023 Proceedings that they agreed on the admissibility and authenticity of the documents included in the Joint Book of Documents. However, they did not agree on the truthfulness of their contents.\nAffidavit Filed by the Respondent\n[23] On September 29, 2021, immediately after the Appellant had closed the evidentiary portion of its case, the Respondent attempted to enter an affidavit sworn on September 20, 2021 by Mr. Jonathan Shimizu, a CRA tax appeals case specialist. The affidavit relates to the Appellant\u2019s claim for excise tax refunds between January 1, 2006 and January 31, 2012. In the affidavit, Mr. Shimizu provides his opinion of when the Excise Tax Act allows for a refund for excise tax paid on fuel and he also discusses how the CRA records information with respect to refund claims. In addition, he refers to the 90 pages of documents attached to the affidavit. These 90 pages include a 10-page Excel spreadsheet that purportedly shows the CRA\u2019s recording of refund claims for diesel fuel during the January 1, 2006 to January 31, 2009 period and an 80-page document that purportedly shows the CRA\u2019s recording of refund claims for diesel fuel during the February 1, 2009 to January 31, 2012 period.\n[24] Counsel for the Respondent stated that she was entering the affidavit pursuant to subsection 335(5) of the GST Act. She stated that if the Crown satisfies the conditions of subsection 335(5) then the Crown may tender the evidence without the necessity of producing a live witness to put that evidence before the Court.[3] In other words, counsel believed that if the conditions of subsection 335(5) are satisfied, the Court must admit the affidavit.\n[25] She also stated that with this type of affidavit, no cross-examination of Mr. Shimizu \u201cis required and no opportunity for cross-examination is required\u201d.[4] Moreover, she argued that the Respondent\u2019s actions did not offend rule 89 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cGeneral Procedure Rules\u201d).\n[26] Rule 89 is relevant because the 90 pages of documents attached to the affidavit were not on the Appellant\u2019s list of documents or the Respondent\u2019s list of documents, were not provided in answers to undertakings during discovery, and were not even informally given to the Appellant before the Appellant closed the evidentiary portion of its case.\n[27] Further, the documents attached to the affidavit were not mentioned in the pleadings, and the Appellant had not waived discovery of the documents.\n[28] Counsel for the Appellant strenuously objected to the admission of the affidavit and the 90 pages of documents attached to it. Counsel for the Appellant clearly explained the issue with the Respondent\u2019s conduct as follows:\nJustice, we\u2019re put in a very difficult position here because fundamentally my friend stands up and says, \u201cthis is non-controversial evidence\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be anything further from the truth. It goes to the basis upon which a significant portion of the appellant\u2019s claim rests \u2026 And what\u2019s particularly galling to me is that the respondent would choose not to provide this evidence to us before now. They swear the affidavit on the 20th, they don\u2019t even give it to us on Monday morning, when our clients are here. They carefully wait until we\u2019ve closed our case and then voila here\u2019s an affidavit. Won\u2019t even speak to what it goes to or what they\u2019re relying on it for. And of course that\u2019s the whole purpose of the discovery process is for the parties have a chance to consider these things.[5]\n\u2026\nWe can\u2019t proceed, Justice, and that\u2019s the problem. And why that doesn\u2019t work is because we can\u2019t rest our case and argue a case when we\u2019re not able to ascertain the relevance and significance of the evidence that the Crown at 4:30 on a Wednesday afternoon with argument on Friday suddenly springs on the Court without any justification for why they\u2019re springing it now instead of, for example, even if they had provided us with the affidavit when it was commissioned, then we would have had a chance to explore that. But to do it at this time is outrageous candidly.[6]\n[29] I agree completely with counsel for the Appellant; this was a blatant attempt at trial by ambush in respect of a key issue in the appeals.\n[30] The Respondent\u2019s actions defeated the purpose of discovery. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Juman v. Doucette, \u201c\u2026 a proper pre-trial discovery is essential to prevent surprise or \u2018litigation by ambush\u2019, to encourage settlement once the facts are known, and to narrow issues even where settlement proves unachievable.\u201d[7]\n[31] The main purpose of rule 89 of the Court\u2019s General Procedure Rules is to avoid trial by ambush. The rule provides that no document shall be used in evidence by a party unless:\n-a reference to the document appears in the pleadings, or in a party\u2019s list of documents or in the affidavit filed with the list of documents;\n-it was produced at the examination for discovery; or\n- it was produced by a witness who was not under the control of the party.\n[32] In the current appeals, none of these conditions were satisfied. As a result, the document was not admissible unless the Respondent obtained the consent of the Appellant or unless the Court directed that the affidavit be admitted.\n[33] As I will discuss, eventually the Appellant withdrew its objection to the affidavit and the Court allowed it to be admitted. But this was done at a cost.\n[34] Further, the fact that the affidavit was eventually admitted does not change the fact that the Respondent attempted a trial by ambush.\n[35] I also have a serious concern with respect to the Respondent\u2019s attempt to use an affidavit in appeals such as the ones before the Court, especially when the Respondent, at that point in time, did not intend to call any fact witnesses.\n[36] As noted in Sopinka on the Trial of an Action,[8] \u201c[T]he general rule is that witnesses are to attend in court to give their evidence orally. Affidavit evidence may be admitted as an exception to prove facts which are not contentious, but will generally not be allowed where the evidence is contentious, or the credibility of the witness is in issue.\u201d[9]\n[37] In my view, an affidavit has no place in a trial where the facts are in issue, such as the trial before the Court. The Court is a trial court; evidence must come in through witnesses so that this evidence can be tested on cross-examination.\n[38] Only in exceptional circumstances will the Court allow affidavit evidence, and even then, this evidence can be admitted only when the facts are not contentious. In my view, affidavit evidence should never be allowed when it is an attempt to circumvent the Court\u2019s General Procedure Rules and would lead to a trial by ambush.\n[39] As counsel for the Appellant noted, and as can be seen from my reasons for judgment, the Appellant\u2019s ability to claim input tax credits for GST paid on fuel is a key issue in the appeals before the Court. Further, the Respondent is relying on the Appellant\u2019s claims for excise tax refunds to support his argument.\n[40] The Respondent\u2019s actions in these appeals are consistent with a troubling trend of the Respondent not bringing witnesses to the hearings of taxpayers\u2019 appeals and then attempting to enter evidence through affidavits. Recently, the Court has seen this happen frequently in informal proceedings. The Respondent now appears to be attempting to use the same ill-advised approach in general proceedings.\n[41] In my view, this conduct must stop. The Court issues judgments based on the evidence before it. If the Respondent wishes to rely on facts that he cannot obtain through cross-examination of the Appellant\u2019s witnesses, then he needs to bring witnesses. Considering the vast resources of the CRA, this should not be an issue.\n[42] My third concern with the affidavit relates to the Respondent\u2019s argument with respect to the application of subsection 335(5) of the GST Act.\n[43] Subsection 335(5) provides that an affidavit properly sworn by an officer of the CRA setting out that the officer has charge of the appropriate records and that a document attached to the affidavit is a document or a true copy of a document or a print-out of an electronic document made by or on behalf of the Minister is evidence of the nature and contents of the document. For purposes of appeals and applications before this Court, the reference to a document made by or on behalf of the Minister is normally a reference to a document made by the CRA.\n[44] The Respondent does not appear to appreciate that subsection 335(5) does not address the truthfulness of the contents of the document. This subsection states that the affidavit is evidence of the nature and contents of the CRA document. In my view, the words \u201cevidence of the nature and contents\u201d refer to the authenticity of the CRA document and the fact that the affidavit evidences what is stated in the CRA document.\n[45] For example, the affidavit of Mr. Shimizu is evidence that the attached documents are copies of authentic CRA documents and the documents evidence what is stated in the documents. The documents attached to Mr. Shimzu\u2019s affidavit evidence how the CRA recorded the Appellant\u2019s refund claims; they are not evidence of the truth (\u201ccorrectness\u201d) of what the documents say.\n[46] The Respondent argued that subsection 335(5) allows a document to be presented without cross-examination and that it allows the Minister to file documents without calling a witness.\n[47] There is nothing in the wording of subsection 335(5) to support such a position. The subsection simply states that the affidavit is evidence of the nature and contents of the attached CRA document. It does not state that the document is admissible in a hearing or that it can be presented without cross-examination.\n[48] These are decisions that are only made by the Court under its jurisdiction to control the processes of the Court.\n[49] The Court\u2019s decision in Carcone v. The Queen[10], (\u201cCarcone\u201d), a decision relied on by the Respondent, illustrates the danger of the Respondent\u2019s position. The Court\u2019s decision in that case was in respect of the applicant\u2019s application for an order extending the time within which notices of objection to reassessments may be filed. During the hearing, the Respondent filed an affidavit under subsection 244(9) of the Income Tax Act, which is very similar to subsection 335(5) of the GST Act. Subsection 244(9) of the Income Tax Act also contains the wording that the affidavit is evidence of the nature and contents of the CRA documents.\n[50] Similar to Mr. Shimizu\u2019s affidavit, the affidavit in Carcone provided evidence with respect to information in the CRA\u2019s records. However, in Carcone, the CRA person who swore the subsection 244(9) affidavit was called as a witness at the hearing and was cross-examined by counsel for the applicant. This cross\u2011examination showed that the information taken from the CRA\u2019s records was incorrect; the information did not, as claimed in the affidavit, reflect information provided by the taxpayer.[11] In short, once the evidence was tested under cross\u2011examination, it was proven to be incorrect. Carcone is an example of why, in appeals such as the ones before the Court, untested evidence provided by an affidavit should only be placed before the Court in exceptional circumstances.\n[51] My fourth concern with Mr. Shimizu\u2019s affidavit is that it contains more than what is permitted under subsection 335(5). Paragraph 4 of the affidavit contains opinion evidence on excise tax law, and paragraphs 5 to 8 contain evidence with respect to the CRA\u2019s internal systems.\n[52] In the current appeals, once counsel for the Appellant raised her concerns, Justice D\u2019Auray adjourned the hearing to allow counsel for the Appellant to consult with her client. The Appellant then filed written submissions on October 6, 2021, and the Respondent filed written submissions on October 18, 2021. On October 26, 2021, just before Justice D\u2019Auray was scheduled to issue her decision on the admissibility of the affidavit, the Appellant wrote to the Court stating that the Appellant had agreed to withdraw its objection to the admission of the affidavit and that the Respondent had agreed that the Appellant should be entitled to recall one or both of its witnesses to provide direct examination evidence regarding the matters in the affidavit. The Appellant also agreed to allow cross-examination of its witness.\n[53] The affidavit was then accepted by the Court.\n[54] Mr. Leamon and Mr. Roach then provided testimony on December 16, 2021 via Zoom. Mr. Leamon was able to provide detailed evidence with respect to the Appellant\u2019s claim for excise tax refunds during the periods at issue. As I noted previously, I will rely on Mr. Leamon\u2019s evidence to the extent that I need to consider the Appellant\u2019s excise tax refunds.\n[55] Closing argument was then held on January 11, 12 and 21, 2022 by Zoom.\n[56] The Respondent\u2019s actions resulted in trial days being thrown away, additional written submissions having to be prepared and filed, and an additional day of testimony by two witnesses. Further, argument was delayed from October 1, 2021 to January 2022. I will deal with the Respondent\u2019s actions in my cost award.\nSummary of Facts\n[57] The Appellant is a federal Crown corporation that provides a constitutionally mandated passenger and commercial marine transportation system between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.\n[58] The constitutionally mandated ferry service is provided between Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia. The sail takes approximately six to eight hours. The Appellant also operates a seasonal route between Argentia, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia. The seasonal sail takes approximately 16 hours, is not constitutionally mandated and runs between mid-June and late-September.\n[59] The Appellant operates terminals in Port aux Basques, Argentia, and North Sydney (the \u201cTerminals\u201d). Its head office is located in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, and it has corporate offices in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland.\n[60] During the relevant periods, the Appellant provided its services using a fleet of four vessels (the \u201cVessels\u201d). The Vessels were substantial in size. They were capable of transporting 600 to 700 hundred people and their vehicles. In addition to containing areas for the transportation of vehicles, the ships (other than one ship called the Atlantic Freighter[12]), contained areas that were used for such things as passenger cabins, individual passenger seating, restaurants, retail stores, and bars.\n[61] At the beginning of 2006, the fleet was composed of vessels named the Ericson, the Caribou, the Smallwood and the Atlantic Freighter. By April 2011, the Caribou, the Smallwood and the Atlantic Freighter had been replaced by vessels named the Atlantic Vision, the Blue Puttees and the Highlanders (the \u201cNew Vessels\u201d).[13]\n[62] The Appellant imported each of the New Vessels into Canada before placing it in service.\n[63] During the relevant periods, the Appellant made both taxable and exempt GST supplies. The various taxable supplies identified by the Appellant are set out at paragraph 11 of the PASF and in Exhibit A-1, Tab 14. The specific taxable supplies identified by the Appellant are as follows:\n-the provision of passenger cabins;\n-the provision of sleeper dorms;\n-the provision of reserved seating (also referred to as day\/nighters);\n-the sale of items in retail stores (including gift shops and speciality shops);\n-the sale of food and beverages in \u00e0 la carte dining halls;\n-the sale of food and beverages in cafeterias;\n-the sale of food and beverages in bars;\n-the provision of kennels;\n-the sale of items through vending machines; and\n- the provision of amusement machines.\n[64] As I will discuss, on the basis of the evidence before the Court, in particular the lack of evidence, it is difficult for the Court to know how the Minister, when assessing the Appellant, calculated the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits. However it appears that at the time of the issuance of the assessments for the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010 (the reporting periods covered by the First Appeal), the Minister accepted that the Appellant had made each of the noted taxable supplies. Yet, before confirming the notices of assessment with respect to the reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010, the CRA changed its view and concluded that the supplies of the passenger cabins, sleeper dorms, and reserved seating were exempt supplies.[14] It also took this position when assessing the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods that are the subject of the Second Appeal.\n[65] On September 17, 2021, shortly before the start of the oral hearing, counsel for the Respondent filed a letter with the Court (the \u201cConcession Letter\u201d) in which she stated that the Minister had conceded that the supplies of the passenger cabins, sleeper dorms and reserved seating were \u201careas of taxable activity\u201d.\n[66] Both parties agree that the Appellant made one exempt supply, the supply of a ferry service. Specifically, the Appellant made the following supply, which section 1 of Part VIII of Schedule V of the GST Act deems to be an exempt supply:\nA supply, other than a zero-related supply, of a service of ferrying by watercraft passengers or property where the principal purpose of the ferrying is to transport motor vehicles and passengers between parts of a road or highway system that are separated by a stretch of water.\n[67] The only issue before the Court is the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to input tax credits in respect of property and services acquired or imported for consumption, use, or supply in the course of its commercial activities.\n[68] Mr. Hupman testified that the operation of each vessel involves an integrated environment. In his words, \u201ceverything depends on everything.\u201d[15] The interior of each of the Appellant\u2019s ships was designed based upon the features that the Appellant required in order to provide its services. For example, the number of passenger cabins, crew cabins, restaurants, snack bars, passenger seating areas and vehicle parking areas required by the Appellant, affected the design of a specific vessel.\n[69] He noted that one of the most important factors that was taken into account when designing the Vessels was seaworthiness, particularly damage stability and intact stability. The Vessels had to be stable in the water.\n[70] Mr. Hupman described each of the taxable supplies made by the Appellant focusing on the nature of the supply and on how a Vessel\u2019s physical space and subsystems were used in making the supply.\n[71] The most significant generator of revenue from taxable supplies was the passenger cabins. The cabins generated annual revenue of between $4.5 and $4.6 million; however, once the New Vessels entered service, this revenue rose to between $6.1 and $7.3 million.[16]\n[72] Mr. Hupman described the cabins as hotel rooms. Each cabin had its own washroom (including a shower), electrical system (to recharge devices), and television. In addition, each cabin has its own HVAC system, meaning that a guest can control the heating and air conditioning for the cabin.\n[73] He noted that the cabins took up a great deal of space on the Vessels. For example, the two or three people who occupy a cabin take up as much space as 40 to 50 people sitting in the general seating area.\n[74] The cabins also added significant weight to the Vessels. Mr. Hupman noted that this was an important issue from a design perspective. He stated that the more weight you have on a vessel, the bigger the internal systems and engines must be to manage the vessel and propel it.\n[75] Since the 100 cabins have 100 showers, sinks and toilets, they also have a significant impact on the ship\u2019s water system and sewage treatment facility.\n[76] Many staff members are required to service and clean the cabins. Since all of the crewmembers live on the ship for two-week periods, this affects various parts of the ship, particularly the crew cabins.\n[77] Catering services were another significant generator of taxable supplies. The Vessels\u2019 galley, cafeterias, dining rooms, bars, and snack bars were used to provide the catering services. In most years, these supplies generated revenue of approximately $3 million.\n[78] Mr. Hupman noted that the catering services had a significant impact on the design of the Vessels. The catering services required a significant amount of space on the Vessels and relied on numerous subsystems of the Vessels. He provided the following examples:\n-The galley used to prepare the food for the various food service outlets took up a significant amount of space. It required marine equipment of a special quality and grade.\n-A separate space was required to process and clean the dishes and cutlery to avoid cross-contamination.\n-The restaurants, which seat approximately 100 people, took up a great deal of space. In addition, a vessel must provide space to allow for the turnover of customers using the restaurants. Mr. Hupman explained that, while a restaurant had the ability to seat around 100 passengers, there were somewhere between 600 and 700 people on each vessel. A vessel had to provide space to allow, over the six- to eight-hour journey, as many people as possible to use the restaurant. He referred to this as the turnover of customers.\n-Significant storage space was required to operate the catering services. Each vessel had cold storage, bulk stores and freezer\/cooler storage. These stored the food required to feed thousands of passengers and the crew.\n-The area used to provide the catering services utilized a number of what were referred to as technical systems, including:\n\u00a7the HVAC systems;\n\u00a7the potable water system, which provided drinkable water that was used for both drinking and washing the dishes and cutlery;\n\u00a7the sewage treatment facility; and\n\u00a7a composting area that was required for the physical food waste generated by the catering services.\n[79] As a result, the catering services affected the size of the various tanks on the Vessels that were used to store the potable water (the Appellant did not produce water\u2013it was loaded prior to a crossing) and to operate the sewage system. For example, the sewage generated from the catering had a notable impact on the size of the tanks.\n[80] Each vessel had to be crewed to support the catering services. As with other crewmembers, these crewmembers were on board the Vessels for two-week periods. As a result, the Vessels required crew cabins for those who provided the catering services.\n[81] The day\/night seating was another source of taxable supplies. These seats were larger than the normal seating and were contained in a separate space. The Appellant charged a fee for the use of these seats. Annual revenue from these taxable supplies was between $60,000 and $89,000 in the earlier years but climbed to $254,000 once the New Vessels were added to the fleet. Mr. Hupman noted that these seats required more floor space than the general seating. This space consumed heating and air conditioning.\n[82] The retail stores were another source of taxable supplies. The stores sold day-to-day amenities, souvenirs and other confection items. Space was required for the stores and for storage of the stores goods. In most of the years under appeal, the retail stores generated between $500,000 and $600,000 of revenue.\n[83] Other sources of taxable supplies were the kennels, vending machines and amusement machines. All required space and consumed electricity for lights, heating and air conditioning. The amusement machines, in particular, consumed a significant amount of electricity.\n[84] Mr. Hupman testified that 50% of the crew on board a vessel worked directly in the areas that made taxable supplies. Crew cabins were required for each of the crewmembers.\n[85] He noted that crew cabins were similar to the passenger cabins and thus had the same impact on the operating systems of the vessel. However, since the crew cabins were the person\u2019s \u201chome away from home\u201d, the cabins contained a few extra features. These included mini-fridges and a higher electrical outage to allow for the use of various other appliances and devices. As a result, the electrical load in the crew cabins was higher than the load in the passenger cabins.\n[86] Mr. Hupman noted that there were two areas of the ships that the Appellant treated as being used exclusively in the making of the exempt supply of the ferry service. One was the area where passengers parked their cars and trucks. The Appellant referred to this area as the passenger vehicle decks. Passengers were not permitted on the vehicle decks while the vessel was sailing.\n[87] Mr. Hupman acknowledged that an argument could be made that the passenger vehicle decks had a strong nexus to the making of taxable supplies. For example, passengers who had booked cabins had to park their cars on the passenger vehicle decks before walking to their cabins. The Appellant believed that treating the passenger vehicle area as an exclusively exempt area supported a fair and reasonable allocation of the Appellant\u2019s costs to taxable and exempt supplies. This was a prudent decision.\n[88] The second area of the ships that the Appellant treated as being used exclusively in the making of the exempt supply of the ferry service was the general seating area. Any passenger who received the exempt supply of the ferry service was entitled to use the general seating area.\n[89] In addition to the areas of the Vessels used exclusively to make exempt supplies and the areas used exclusively to make taxable supplies, the Appellant identified numerous areas that, in Mr. Hupman\u2019s words, had a connection to both the making of the taxable supplies and the making of the exempt transportation service. These included all areas of the ships that were not used solely in the making of either taxable supplies or exempt supplies. The Appellant refers to these areas as the common areas.\n[90] The common areas, which are summarized in Exhibit A-1 at Tabs 3 to 9, varied from ship to ship depending on the design of the ship. They included corridors, walkways, stairways, public washrooms, the exterior deck (also referred to as the outside seating or open deck space or the exterior walking deck), the galley, galley stores, the hospital room, the bridge, crew cabins, the officers\u2019 and crew\u2019s mess area, crew laundry, the wheelhouse, the engine room, the auxiliary engine room, the air conditioning room, the pump room, maintenance shops, the sewage plant, the boiler room, fuel and ballast water tanks, void spaces,[17] the generator compartment, the control room, mooring stations, hydraulic machinery compartments,[18] the stabilizer room, and the fire control room.\nThe Law\n[91] The GST is levied under four separate and distinct divisions of the GST Act, Division II, Division III, Division IV and Division IV.1 of the GST Act. Each of these divisions imposes the tax. For example, a single transaction may be taxed under both Division II and Division III.\n[92] Under Division II, the tax is levied on taxable supplies that are made in Canada. This is the tax levied on supplies that occur in Canada. Division II tax is levied either at the 5% GST rate or at the higher 13%\/15% HST rates. The 5% GST rate applies to goods and services consumed in so-called non\u2011participating provinces (Quebec and all provinces west of Ontario). The 13% HST rate is applied to goods and services consumed in Ontario and the 15% HST rate is applied to goods and services consumed in one of the Atlantic provinces. Ontario and the Atlantic provinces are referred to as the participating provinces.\n[93] The Division II tax is collected by the supplier of the good or service.\n[94] Under Division III, the tax is levied on all goods imported into Canada, regardless of whether or not the goods are subject to Canadian customs duties. The tax is levied and collected by the Canada Border Services Agency at the time of importation. All commercial importations are taxed at 5%. Non\u2011commercial importations are taxed at either the 5% GST rate or the 13%\/15% HST rates, depending on whether the importer is a resident of a non-participating or a participating province.\n[95] Under Division IV, the tax is levied on imported services and intangible personal property. The recipient of the imported service or intangible personal property pays the tax on a self-assessing basis directly to the CRA. Generally speaking, a recipient only self-assesses Division IV tax if it imports the service or intangible personal property for use in activities that do not constitute GST commercial activities.[19]\n[96] Division IV.1 is intended to ensure that consumers in a participating province do not avoid the higher HST rate by acquiring goods and services in non-participating provinces. Division IV.1 tax is imposed on goods and services imported into a participating province. Similar to Division IV, Division IV.1 tax is imposed on a self-assessing basis and does not apply if the person is entitled to claim full input tax credits in respect of the imported property or service.\n[97] As noted previously, the Appellant made a number of taxable supplies on the ships. Each of these taxable supplies was subject to Division II tax. The Appellant was required to add such tax when calculating, under subsection 225(1), its net tax for a specific reporting period.\n[98] When calculating its net tax, the Appellant was entitled to claim input tax credits in respect of tax that it paid under divisions II, III, IV and IV.1.\n[99] The evidence before me is that during the relevant periods, the Appellant paid Division II, Division III and Division IV.1 tax. It paid Division II tax on goods and services that it acquired in Canada for consumption, use or supply when operating its ferry service. Division III tax was paid when it imported the New Vessels into Canada, and Division IV.1 tax was paid when it first brought each of the New Vessels into a participating province (either Newfoundland and Labrador or Nova Scotia).[20]\n[100] When calculating its net tax under subsection 225(1), a person, such as the Appellant, may claim input tax credits. Subsection 169(1) of the GST Act contains the general rules for the claiming of input tax credits. The applicable portions of subsection 169(1) read as follows:\nSubject to this Part, where a person acquires or imports property or a service or brings it into a participating province and, during a reporting period of the person during which the person is a registrant, tax in respect of the supply, importation or bringing in becomes payable by the person or is paid by the person without having become payable, the amount determined by the following formula is an input tax credit of the person in respect of the property or service for the period\nA x B\nwhere\nA is the tax in respect of the supply, importation or bringing in, as the case may be, that becomes payable by the person during the reporting period or that is paid by the person during the period without having become payable; and\nB is\n...\n(c) ... the extent (expressed as a percentage) to which the person acquired or imported the property or service or brought it into the participating province, as the case may be, for consumption, use or supply in the course of commercial activities of the person.\n[101] Subsection 169(1) provides for input tax credits for Division II, Division III, Division IV and Division IV.1 tax. The reference in the opening paragraph of subsection 169(1) to a person acquiring property or a service and tax in respect of the supply being paid or payable is a reference to Division II tax. The reference to a person importing property or a service and tax in respect of the importation being paid or payable is a reference to Division III or Division IV tax. The reference to a person bringing a property or a service into a participating province and tax in respect of the bringing in being paid or becoming payable is a reference to Division IV.1 tax.\n[102] The Appellant is entitled to claim input tax credits for the Division II, Division III and Division IV.1 tax that it paid to the extent it satisfies the conditions of subsection 169(1) in respect of each acquisition, importation or bringing into a participating province of a good or service. Specifically, the Appellant is entitled to claim an input tax credit for a percentage of the tax that it paid in respect of the acquisition or importation of a specific property or service or in respect of the bringing of a property or service into a participating province. The percentage is based upon the extent that the Appellant acquired or imported the relevant property or service or brought it into a participating province for consumption, use or supply in the course of its commercial activities.\n[103] As a result of subsection 169(1), a person\u2019s ability to claim input tax credits is dependent on its intended or actual use of the property or service in its commercial activities. Commercial activity is defined in subsection 123(1). The relevant portion of the definition, for the purposes of these appeals is \u201c(a) a business carried on by the person \u2026 except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person\u201d.\n[104] Business is defined in subsection 123(1) as follows:\n\u201cbusiness\u201d includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit, and any activity engaged in on a regular or continuous basis that involves the supply of property by way of lease, licence or similar arrangement, but does not include an office or employment.\n[105] As I noted in Stewardship Ontario v. The Queen[21] and University of Calgary v. The Queen (\u201cUniversity of Calgary\u201d)[22] under the GST Act, a person\u2019s business is broader than the person\u2019s commercial activity. A business includes all of the activities of a person, regardless of whether the activities involve the making of taxable supplies or of exempt supplies. However, a commercial activity only includes the activities of the business that do not involve the making of exempt supplies.\n[106] On the basis of the evidence before me, I have concluded that the Appellant carried on a single business, namely the transportation of persons and vehicles by ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In the course of this business, the Appellant made both taxable supplies and exempt supplies. As a result, the activities that the Appellant carried out when carrying on its transportation business constituted commercial activities, except to the extent that the business involved the making of exempt supplies.\n[107] Since the Appellant made both taxable and exempt supplies, it had to determine, for each acquisition or importation of property or a service, the extent to which it acquired or imported the specific property or service for consumption, use or supply in the course of its commercial activities. It had to make a similar determination for the property (the New Vessels) that it brought into Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n[108] The Appellant had to do this for both the property and services that it used directly in the making of a specific supply and for the property and services that it used indirectly in the making of a specific supply. When determining the extent to which a person may claim input tax credits for property and services used indirectly in the making of a specific supply, one must consider the section 141.01 input tax credit apportionment rules.\n[109] I explained in detail the operation of subsections 141.01(2) and (3) at paragraphs 94 to 109 of my reasons for judgment in University of Calgary (see Appendix A).\n[110] The key point for purposes of the current appeals is that when determining input tax credits for a person, one must attribute all costs that the person incurs in the course of its business to the making of supplies. This includes both direct costs and indirect costs.\n[111] Once all of the costs are attributed, then one must determine, for each individual direct cost and indirect cost, the extent to which the relevant property or service was acquired, imported or brought into a participating province for consumption, use or supply in the course of the person\u2019s commercial activities.\n[112] As a result of subsection 141.01(2), property or a service is deemed to have been acquired, imported or brought into a participating province for consumption or use in the course of the person\u2019s commercial activities to the extent that the property or service is acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration in the course of the person\u2019s business.\n[113] In most instances, when a GST registrant is making both taxable and exempt supplies, this requires the registrant to develop an allocation method or formula.\n[114] In doing so, the registrant must comply with subsection 141.01(5). Paragraph 141.01(5)(a) provides that the methods used by a person in a fiscal year to determine the extent to which properties or services are acquired, imported or brought into a participating province by the person for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration or for other purposes must be fair and reasonable and are to be used consistently by the person throughout the year.\n[115] Paragraph 141.01(5)(b) sets out an identical rule for actual consumption or use of the properties or services. It provides, in part, that the methods used by a person in a fiscal year to determine the extent to which the consumption or use of properties or services is for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration or for other purposes must be fair and reasonable and are to be used consistently by the person throughout the year.\n[116] The issue of what is fair and reasonable was addressed by my colleague Justice Owen in Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. The Queen.[23] He stated the following with respect to the method proposed by the Appellant, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada:\n[37] The definition of the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) that is in my view most appropriate is A.2.a: \u201cHaving sound judgement; sensible, sane. . . . Also, not asking for too much.\u201d The use of the word \u201craisonnables\u201d in the French version of the provision supports this interpretation.\n[38] The use of a reasonableness requirement in tax legislation has been considered in other contexts. In Bailey v. M.N.R., [1989] T.C.J. No. 602 (QL), 89 DTC 416, the Court stated (at page 420):\nWhat is \u201creasonable\u201d is not the subjective view of either the respondent or appellant but the view of an objective observer with a knowledge of all the pertinent facts: Canadian Propane Gas & Oil Limited v. M.N.R., 73 DTC 5019 per Cattanach J. at 5028.\n[39] In Maege v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 117, the Court adopted the general approach to determining reasonableness set out in Tsiantoulas v. Canada, [1994] T.C.J. No. 984 (QL), where the Court stated at paragraph 11:\nReasonableness is a question of fact and requires the application of a measure of judgement and common sense.\n[40] I can see no reason why the general approach to determining reasonableness in these cases would not also apply to determining whether a particular method is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d. That is to say, what is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d is a question of fact and requires the application of a measure of judgment and common sense. The determination is not based on the subjective view of either the Appellant or the Respondent but is based on the view of an objective observer with knowledge of all the pertinent facts. It is also important to recognize that the tax authorities cannot simply substitute their approach for that of Sun Life and that there may be more than one method that is fair and reasonable in the circumstances (see Ville de Magog v. The Queen, supra).\n[117] In my view, this is an accurate statement of the law with respect to the application of the subsection 141.01(5) fair and reasonable test. A GST registrant is entitled to use any method that is fair and reasonable provided that it complies with the provisions of the GST Act. The CRA cannot simply substitute its method for that of the GST registrant.\n[118] The question to be asked is whether the GST registrant\u2019s methodology allocates the GST paid on inputs to its taxable supplies (i.e. its commercial activities) in a reasonable manner. When answering this question, one should consider the business activities of the GST registrant, focusing on the particular activities that consume or use the taxable inputs. An allocation method should not distort the financial reality of the commercial activity.[24]\n[119] The Federal Court of Appeal in Magog (City of) v. Canada stated:\nIt is important in this regard to note that the Act does not require the appellant to establish the type of accounting systems that would enable it to separate out each property or service that is consumed or used in the context of its mixed activities. Parliament was aware that such a requirement could result in compliance expenses that would exceed the tax yielded. So it left it to the taxpayer to select an appropriate method, while requiring that the method chosen be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d.[25]\n[120] For the same reason, as I noted in University of Calgary, a GST registrant should be entitled to determine its input tax credits on the basis of information in its possession without having to resort to hiring expensive third parties, such as valuators or, as I will discuss, engineers to measure spaces on its ships or experts to try to determine what percentage of fuel is consumed to propel a ship and what percentage is consumed to produce electricity, heat or hot water.\n[121] Subject to section 141, the percentage determined using the GST registrant\u2019s chosen method decides the amount of input tax credits that it is entitled to claim on its GST return. Section 141 contains what is referred to as the substantially all test. Subsection 141(1) provides that if substantially all of the consumption or use of property or a service is in the course of the GST registrant\u2019s commercial activities, then all the consumption or use of the property or service is deemed to be in the course of commercial activities. Conversely, subsection 141(3) provides that if substantially all of the consumption or use of property or a service is in the course of activities of the GST registrant that are not commercial activities, then all the consumption or use is deemed to be in the course of non-commercial activities of the GST registrant.[26]\nApplication of the Law to the Facts\n[122] The Appellant made both taxable and exempt supplies during the relevant periods. As a result, it was required to develop an allocation method or formula in order to determine the extent to which each of its individual direct costs and indirect costs was acquired, imported or brought into a participating province for consumption, use or supply in the course of its commercial activities.\n[123] Prior to 2006, the Appellant used what is referred to as an output method to calculate its input tax credits. An output method does not attempt to trace an input to the related supply or supplies, but rather looks only at the nature of the revenue earned by the supplier of the goods and services.\n[124] Using this method, the Appellant first determined what the percentage of its total revenue was revenue from taxable supplies. It then applied this percentage to the GST that it paid to determine its input tax credits. The percentage was approximately 11% to 12%.[27]\n[125] It appears that the CRA accepted this percentage.\n[126] In certain situations, the Court has accepted the output method. However, it clearly can lead to distortions since it does not attempt to trace inputs to actual supplies. For example, if the taxable supplies of a GST registrant use fewer taxable inputs than the exempt supplies made by the registrant, the input tax credits will be overstated. This can occur if the taxable supplies have a substantially higher profit margin (incur fewer taxable inputs) or if a significantly higher amount of non-taxable inputs, such as salary and wages, are used to make the taxable supplies. In such a situation, the output method would not reflect the business activities that consume or use the taxable inputs.\n[127] Mr. Leamon explained that in 2005, the Appellant was approached by a number of consultants advising it that, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision in Bay Ferries it should review its method of calculating input tax credits.\n[128] The Appellant subsequently retained the Deloitte accounting firm and, after discussions with the firm, decided to change its allocation method to a so-called input method, a method that attempts to trace inputs to the related supplies.\n[129] When determining a methodology, the Appellant considered the fact that all, or nearly all, of its revenue came from supplies made on the Vessels: the exempt supply of the ferry transportation service and the numerous taxable supplies. Relying on this fact, it decided to allocate all of its inputs to its taxable and exempt supplies using a method that is based on the use that the Appellant made of the space on each vessel.\n[130] It grouped areas on the Vessels into three categories:\n-areas used in the making of exempt supplies (exempt areas);\n-areas used in the making of taxable supplies (taxable areas); and\n- areas used in the making of both taxable and exempt supplies (common areas).\n[131] Mr. Hupman explained that the Appellant categorized each area of the Vessels by looking at what the area was actually meant to do. If the area was intended to be used solely to generate income from taxable supplies (such as the passenger cabins and restaurants), then it was included in the taxable areas. If the area was intended to be used solely to generate income from exempt supplies (such as the passenger vehicle decks and the general seating area), then it was included in the exempt areas. Finally, if the area had a connection to both the taxable supplies and the exempt supplies, meaning that it was intended to be used directly or indirectly for both, then it was treated as a common area.\n[132] It is the Appellant\u2019s position that the extent to which it acquired, imported or brought into a participating province property or services for consumption, use, or supply in the course of its commercial activities can be determined by taking the total square metres of all areas of the Vessels that were used exclusively in the making of taxable supplies for consideration and dividing this figure by the total of the square metres of all areas of the Vessels that were used exclusively in the making of taxable supplies for consideration and the square metres of all areas of the Vessels that were used exclusively in the making of exempt supplies.\n[133] Originally, the Appellant had used the following formula: the total square metres of the areas of the Vessels used in making taxable supplies divided by the difference between the total area of the Vessels and the total square meters of the common areas of the Vessels[28]. This calculation leads to the same result as the calculation set out in the previous paragraph, since the total area of the Vessels minus the total square metres of the common areas is equal to the total of the areas used to make the taxable supplies and the areas used to make the exempt supplies. Under the Appellant\u2019s final method, there is no need to measure the common areas.\n[134] Using this methodology, the Appellant arrived at the following percentages (the Appellant\u2019s Final Percentages or Final Percentages)[29]:\n-Reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2011: 24.52%\n- Reporting periods ending between April 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012: 18.11%\n[135] The percentage was reduced from 24.52% to 18.11% on account of a change in the composition of the Vessels, which occurred when the New Vessels replaced the Caribou, the Smallwood and the Atlantic Freighter.\n[136] The Appellant applied the relevant Final Percentage to the total amount of HST that it paid in each reporting period. This included HST that it paid for goods and services consumed or used on the Vessels, in the Terminals and at the Appellant\u2019s corporate offices. It also included the Division III and Division IV.1 tax that it paid on the importation of the New Vessels.\n[137] By applying the Final Percentages to the total amount of HST paid, including the HST that it paid on goods and services acquired for consumption or use in respect of the operation of the Terminals and the Appellant\u2019s corporate offices, the Appellant treated the Terminals and the corporate offices as common areas \u2013 namely as areas that were used to support the making of both taxable and exempt supplies on the Vessels. This is the result since the formula used by the Appellant only includes the areas used directly in the making of taxable supplies and directly in the making of exempt supplies on the Vessels. Therefore, any remaining areas, which would include the remaining areas on the Vessels, the corporate offices and the Terminals, must be areas that the Appellant determined it used to support the making of both taxable and exempt supplies on the Vessels.\n[138] Mr. Hupman and Mr. Leamon explained in some detail how the Appellant arrived at its Final Percentages. In 2005, the Appellant met with representatives from Deloitte to agree on the method that the Appellant was to use to determine its entitlement to input tax credits. The Appellant provided Deloitte with detailed cross plans of each of its Vessels. Deloitte reviewed the plans with the Appellant, discussed the various areas on each of the Vessels, and then visited each of the Vessels. During the visits to the Vessels, Deloitte discussed the Vessels\u2019 operations with onboard staff.\n[139] Using this information, Deloitte and the Appellant calculated the 24.52% that the Appellant used to determine the input tax credits that it claimed when determining its net tax for the reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010.\n[140] The Appellant did not use the 24.52% to determine input tax credits that it claimed when determining its net tax for the reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Instead, it used 15.57%. This was a percentage mandated by the CRA. The CRA informed the Appellant that if it used the 24.52% instead of the CRA\u2019s 15.57%, the CRA would assess the Appellant to reduce its input tax credits to an amount calculated using the 15.57% and impose penalties. Mr. Hupman explained to the Court that even though the Appellant considered that the proper percentage was, and continues to be, the 24.52%, it decided that it had to use the CRA percentage since, as a Crown corporation, it could not take a position that would result in the imposition of penalties.\n[141] I am troubled by the CRA\u2019s conduct. The CRA should never threaten penalties to force a GST registrant to accept the CRA\u2019s allocation method. The law is clear: the CRA cannot simply substitute its approach for that of the Appellant, and there may be more than one method that is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The Appellant was proposing a methodology that it had developed after a substantial review of its operations. In such a situation, it is inconceivable that the Appellant\u2019s conduct met the standard for a gross negligence penalty. It appears that the CRA was using the threat of penalties to force the Appellant into accepting the CRA\u2019s 15.57%, the calculation of which was not explained to the Court and not explained to the Appellant.\n[142] The Appellant revisited the 24.52% when the New Vessels were brought into service in March 2009 (the Atlantic Vision), April 2011 (the Blue Puttees), and April 2011 (the Highlanders). It retained a naval architect\/marine consultant to prepare the necessary cross plans (with measurements) for the New Vessels. The cross plans were required as a result of a number of modifications that the Appellant made to the New Vessels before placing them in service.\n[143] The Appellant worked with Deloitte to determine the taxable and exempt areas on the Atlantic Vision and made the determinations by itself for the Blue Puttees and the Highlanders. It arrived at a new percentage of 18.11%. However, it did not calculate its input tax credits using the 18.11%. Instead, it claimed input tax credits for the reporting periods ending between April 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012 using 12%. The 12% was based on \u201cCRA methodology\u201d that the Appellant disagreed with, but similar to the earlier reporting periods, the Appellant decided to use the 12% to avoid being assessed penalties.\n[144] As a result of an undertaking provided during discovery in these appeals, the Appellant retained an engineering firm to complete measurements of each of the Vessels and identify all spaces on the Vessels. The engineering firm\u2019s measurements resulted in the same 18.11% calculated by the Appellant for the period from April 2011 to January 2012 and in percentages that were within 0.25% of the percentages that have been calculated for the remaining periods. Unfortunately, the Appellant incurred over 1,000 internal labour hours and over $70,000 in costs during this process. This is the very type of expense that a GST registrant should not be required to incur. A GST registrant should be entitled to determine its input tax credits on the basis of information in its possession. It should not be required to retain expensive third parties.\n[145] During the hearing, Mr. Hupman took the Court through the detailed cross plans for each vessel, describing each area of the ships and its use.\n[146] In summary, it is the Appellant\u2019s position that between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2011, 24.52% of the property and services that it acquired, imported or brought into a participating province were acquired, imported or brought into a participating province for consumption, use or supply in the course of its commercial activities. The percentage is 18.11% for the period from April 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012.\n[147] As mentioned previously, the CRA did not agree with the Appellant\u2019s calculations. The evidence before me is that the Respondent\u2019s position on a reasonable allocation method has been fluid, changing frequently since the time of the assessments. Some of these changes arose after the Respondent (or the Minister) became aware that some of his factual assumptions were incorrect, while other changes represent a change in the Respondent\u2019s position with respect to what he considers is fair and reasonable.\n[148] For the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2009, the CRA performed separate calculations for input tax credits relating to the HST that the Appellant paid when acquiring fuel and the HST that it paid on all other acquired property and services. When assessing the Appellant, the Minister allowed input tax credits equal to 15.57% of the HST paid by the Appellant on non-fuel inputs. She also allowed input tax credits equal to 12.456% of the HST that the Appellant paid in respect of the fuel that it purchased for use in the Vessels\u2019 auxiliary engines. She did not allow any input tax credits for the HST that the Appellant paid when acquiring fuel for use in a Vessels\u2019 main engines.\n[149] For the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods ending between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010, the Minister reassessed to allow for input tax credits equal to 17.20% of the HST that the Appellant paid on non-fuel inputs and 13.76% of the HST that the Appellant paid in respect of the fuel that it purchased for use in the Vessels\u2019 auxiliary engines. She denied inputs tax credits for the HST that the Appellant paid when acquiring fuel for use in the Vessels\u2019 main engines.\n[150] The CRA\u2019s Appeals Division confirmed these reassessments.\n[151] For the Appellant\u2019s reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and January 31, 2012, which is the subject of the Second Appeal, the Minister, relying on section 141, denied all input tax credits on the basis that substantially all of the use of the property and services acquired by the Appellant during this period were consumed or used in exempt activities. Paragraph 24 of the Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Further Amended Notice of Appeal for the Second Appeal (the \u201cReply \u2013 Second Appeal\u201d) states that the \u201cMinister determined that the average indirect ITC allocation ratio was less than 10% for the period under appeal.\u201d\n[152] With respect to the reporting periods that are the subject of the First Appeal, the Respondent did not produce a witness to explain how the CRA calculated the 15.57% and 17.20% for the non-fuel inputs or the 12.456% and 13.76% for the fuel inputs for the auxiliary engines. The Appellant noted that it has never been able to determine how the CRA calculated the percentages.\n[153] The Respondent\u2019s Reply in the First Appeal, the Reply to the Further Amended Notice of Appeal (the \u201cReply \u2013 First Appeal\u201d), is only of limited help in determining how the CRA calculated the percentages.\n[154] Paragraph 19 of the Reply \u2013 First Appeal states that in determining the Appellant\u2019s net tax liability for the periods under appeal, the Minister relied on the assumptions listed in that paragraph including the following:\n-It was unfair and unreasonable to treat the upgraded accommodations on the Vessels (sleeper dorms, cabins and reserved seating area) as areas used exclusively in taxable activities.\n-The provision of upgraded accommodations was part of the single exempt supply of the ferry service of transporting passengers.\n-It was fair and reasonable to treat the provision of the upgraded accommodations areas as an exempt supply.[30]\n[155] However, these are not the assumptions that the Minister relied on when assessing the Appellant. As counsel for the Respondent confirmed during the February 2023 Proceedings, when assessing the Appellant the Minister assumed that the supply of the upgraded accommodations was a taxable supply.\n[156] The assumptions in the Reply \u2013 First Appeal reflect assumptions made by the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division when considering the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Objection. Paragraph 19(hh) of the Reply \u2013 First Appeal states that a fair and reasonable application of the Appellant\u2019s methodology results in percentages of 7.6% and 8.1%, not the 15.57% and 17.20% used by the Minister when she assessed the Appellant. The 7.6% and 8.1% were determined by the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division. However, the CRA Appeals Division confirmed the Minister\u2019s assessments, which were based on the 15.57% and 17.20%.\n[157] The assumptions listed in paragraph 19 of the Reply \u2013 First Appeal appear to be the assumptions made by the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division to support 7.6% and 8.1%. They are not the assumptions that support the 15.57% and 17.20% that the Minister used when assessing the Appellant \u2013 an assessment that the CRA\u2019s Appeals Division confirmed.\n[158] In summary, the Court was not told how the Minister calculated the 15.57% and 17.20% it used when assessing the Appellant for the periods covered by the First Appeal. However, it appears that when calculating the percentages, the Minister treated the Terminals and corporate headquarters as common areas. I have reached this conclusion since the PASF states that if the terminal areas are treated as exempt, the percentage is between 2.78% and 3.44%.[31] The Respondent accepts that the corporate headquarters is a common area.\n[159] Paragraphs 19(ll) to (ww) of the Reply \u2013 First Appeal address the 12.456% and 13.76% applied to the HST paid on fuel related to the auxiliary engines. The Reply \u2013 First Appeal states that the auxiliary engines were used in both taxable and exempt activities, but that less than 10% of the fuel consumed and used by the main engines was attributable to the provision of taxable services.\n[160] As with the percentages related to the non-fuel inputs, the Court was not told by a witness how the Minister calculated the 12.456% and 13.76% she used to determine the input tax credits for the HST that the Appellant paid on the acquisition of fuel for consumption in the auxiliary engines. The Court was also not told what percentage, if any, the Minister calculated for the HST paid on the fuel consumed by the main engines.\n[161] The Respondent did not call a witness to explain how the Minister arrived at the conclusion that, during the periods covered by the Second Appeal, the Appellant consumed or used the property and services it acquired less than 10% in its commercial activities. However, unlike the assumptions in the Reply \u2013 First Appeal, the assumptions set out at paragraph 28 of the Reply \u2013 Second Appeal appear to contain the assumptions that the Minister actually made when assessing the Appellant.\n[162] Paragraphs 19(l), 19(n), 19(p) to (ee), and 19(ii) to (uu) of the Reply \u2013 Second Appeal set out the following assumptions that the Minister made when assessing for the periods covered by the Second Appeal:\n-The Minister assumed that the passenger cabins and day\/night seating were part of a single exempt supply of the ferry service of transporting passengers. The Appellant had assumed that both were used to make taxable supplies.\n-The Minister assumed that the Vessels\u2019 Common Areas (referred to in the Reply \u2013 Second Appeal as \u201cthe other areas on the Vessels including the engine rooms, crew and officers\u2019 quarters and navigational bridge decks\u201d) were in fact not used to make both taxable and exempt supplies, but rather were used exclusively to make exempt supplies.\n-The Minister assumed that the outside seating area was part of a single exempt supply of the ferry service of transporting vehicles. The Appellant had treated this area as part of the Vessels\u2019 Common Areas.\n-The Minister concluded that the input tax credits for HST paid on fuel should be calculated separately from the input tax credits for HST paid for non-fuel property and services. The Minister concluded that the Appellant was not entitled to claim input tax credits for the HST paid on fuel since more than 90% of the fuel consumed and used by the Vessels was attributable to the provision of exempt services. The Appellant did not distinguish between fuel and non-fuel inputs when claiming input tax credits.\n-The Minister concluded that the Appellant acquired and imported the New Vessels for use as capital property. The Minister then denied all input tax credits for Division III and Division IV.1 tax paid on the importation of the New Vessels on the basis that the New Vessels were not acquired, imported or brought into a participating province for use primarily in commercial activities. This would be the result under subsection 199(2) if the New Vessels were capital property of the Appellant.\n[163] As discussed previously, the Respondent made certain concessions prior to the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.\n[164] The first concession was that the passenger cabins and day\/night seating were \u201careas of taxable activity\u201d.\n[165] The second concession was the Respondent\u2019s acceptance that the \u201cinfrastructure areas onboard the ferry vessels were common areas, supporting both taxable and exempt activities\u201d. During the February 2023 Proceedings, counsel for the Respondent confirmed to the Court that the term infrastructure, as used in the Concession Letter, refers, with one exception, to the Vessels\u2019 Common Areas described by the Appellant\u2019s witnesses,[32] which are the areas summarized in Exhibit A-1 at Tabs 3 to 9. The exception is the exterior deck.\n[166] The Respondent does not accept that the exterior deck, which includes the outside seating, open deck space and exterior walking space, is common space.\n[167] The third concession relates to the New Vessels. The Respondent accepts that subsection 199(2) is not applicable with respect to the Division III and Division IV.1 tax paid on the importation of the New Vessels and \u201cas such, \u2018the fair and reasonable\u2019 ITC allocation ratio may be applied to GST\/HST paid on importation.\u201d It appears that the Respondent\u2019s concession is based on the fact that the Appellant leased the New Vessels.\n[168] On September 27, 2021, at the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent made a concession relating to the Appellant\u2019s methodology. She noted that the Respondent does not have an issue with the use of the indirect input allocation method per se. The Respondent\u2019s concern relates to the Appellant\u2019s calculations using the method.[33]\n[169] The Respondent\u2019s current position with respect to the method chosen by the Appellant is set out at paragraph 124 of his written submissions, as follows:\n\u2026 [t]he Minister does not take issue with a methodology based upon an analysis of space used in making both taxable and exempt supplies. The Minister does not say that using an input based area-by-area method utilizing square metre measurements is in and of itself, either unfair or unreasonable. The Minister says that while a measurement-based method may be fair and reasonable, because it was not consistently applied to the totality of MAI\u2019s operations, it was not fair and reasonable or consistently applied.\n[170] In reply to my questions during the February 2023 Proceedings, counsel for the Respondent noted that the Respondent\u2019s concern is with respect to items that were, in counsel\u2019s words, \u201cleft out of the formula\u201d. By items \u201cleft out\u201d, counsel was referring to the Terminals and the exterior deck, which the Appellant treated as common areas.[34]\n[171] In summary, the parties agree that a methodology based on the Appellant\u2019s actual use of space is a fair and reasonable method to determine the extent to which the Appellant acquired property and services, other than fuel, for consumption or use in its commercial activities. Further, the parties agree on the measurements made by the Appellant.\n[172] However, it is the Respondent\u2019s current position that the Appellant did not apply its measurement-based method in a fair and reasonable or consistent manner. The Respondent also argues that a different methodology should be used for the HST paid on the acquisition of fuel.\n[173] In my view, the Appellant\u2019s method allocates the HST paid on its taxable inputs to its commercial activities in a fair and reasonable manner.\n[174] The Appellant carries on a substantial business involving the making of numerous supplies, the vast majority of which occur on the Vessels.[35] As is normally the situation, the determination of the extent to which it acquired individual property or services for use in the course of its commercial activities will never be exact.\n[175] As I noted in University of Calgary, the question is not whether the Appellant\u2019s methodology determines the exact extent to which the Appellant acquired property or services for consumption or use in the course of its commercial activities or whether one of the Respondent\u2019s methodologies is better than the Appellant\u2019s methodology. The question is whether the Appellant\u2019s methodology provides a fair and reasonable estimate of the extent to which the Appellant acquired individual property or services for consumption or use in the course of its commercial activities.\n[176] As discussed previously, the Appellant\u2019s method is based on the total square metres of all areas of the Vessels that were used exclusively in the making of taxable supplies for consideration, the total square metres for all areas of the Vessels that were used exclusively in the making of exempt supplies, and the total amount of HST that the Appellant paid in a specific period on the acquisition of property and services that were consumed or used in all areas of its operations, including operations that were carried out on land.\n[177] Its methodology, particularly the inclusion of all HST paid during the relevant periods, treated the areas of its operations that were not used exclusively to make taxable supplies or exempt supplies as areas that contributed to the making of both taxable and exempt supplies, the so-called common areas. On the basis of the evidence before me, this is a reasonable assumption. The operation of each vessel involves an integrated environment. In Mr. Hupman\u2019s words, everything depends on everything. In such an environment, the common areas facilitate and support all supplies made on the Vessels. As I will discuss, I have reached a similar conclusion with respect to the common areas located on land in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n[178] During the periods at issue, the Appellant operated seven vessels with a combined area of 111,083 square metres.[36] It conducted a detailed review of each area on the Vessels, which included measuring all of these areas. Although not required once it concluded that the terminal areas were common space, it also measured all of the individual areas that comprise the Terminals, which are situated on approximately 257,000 square meters of land, and provided the Court with a detailed description of the use of each of the individual areas of the Terminals.\n[179] In my view, a methodology that is based on the actual use of the space used to carry on an integrated business such as the one carried on by the Appellant and that involves a detailed review of all areas of its operations is a fair and reasonable method for the Appellant to use to determine the extent to which it acquired property and services for use in its commercial activities.\n[180] The Appellant generates 95% of its revenue on the Vessels, meaning that it makes most of its supplies on the Vessels. Therefore, a method based on the space on the Vessels that was used exclusively to make taxable supplies and the space that was used exclusively to make exempt supplies reflects the Appellant\u2019s business activities and does not distort the financial reality of the Appellant\u2019s commercial activities.\n[181] The Respondent raised the concern that the Appellant applied its Final Percentage to all the HST that it paid during the relevant periods, even the HST that related to tax paid on property and services consumed solely in the making of taxable supplies or exempt supplies. The Respondent did not provide any evidence of such property or services.\n[182] On the basis of the evidence before me, the only significant inputs that I can identify that may have been consumed or used exclusively in the making of a specific supply, are some of the property and services that were consumed in the making of the taxable supplies of the passenger cabins and the catering services. It is not clear from the evidence before the Court why, if such inputs did in fact exist, the Appellant did not separate the HST paid on such inputs from the tax paid on other inputs. Regardless, the separation of HST paid on such inputs would have increased the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits since it would have been entitled to claim input tax credits for 100% of such tax.\n[183] As previously noted, the Respondent argues that because the Appellant did not apply its methodology consistently to the totality of the Appellant\u2019s operations this method was not fair or reasonable or consistently applied. Counsel for the Respondent argued that the Appellant left items out, specifically the terminal areas and the exterior deck area. The Respondent\u2019s argument is misplaced. The Appellant, when applying its methodology, did not leave any items out and did in fact apply its methodology to the totality of its operations. It treated the terminal areas and the exterior deck area as common areas.\n[184] Given that the Appellant decided that these areas were common areas, then the size of such areas does not factor into the calculation of the percentages for the relevant periods. The percentages are based solely on the areas used exclusively in the making of taxable supplies and exempt supplies.\n[185] The issue is not whether the Appellant left the items out; the issue is whether the Appellant properly treated the spaces as common areas. As I will discuss, the Respondent\u2019s position is that a substantial portion of the Terminals should have been treated as areas used substantially for the making of exempt supplies. The Respondent also argues that the Appellant used the exterior deck area substantially for the purpose of making exempt supplies.\n[186] It is important to recognize that because of the Respondent\u2019s position with respect to fuel, he is proposing that the Court use a different methodology than the one used by the Appellant. Specifically, as I will discuss, he is asking the Court to use the methodology proposed by the Appellant only if it results in a percentage below 10%. If it results in a percentage of 10% or higher, he is asking the Court to use the Appellant\u2019s methodology only with respect to the HST paid for non-fuel inputs. For HST paid on fuel inputs, the Respondent is asking the Court to try to determine the amount of fuel that the Appellant consumed to propel the Vessels and the amount that it consumed to supply electricity, heat and hot water.\n[187] I will now address the Respondent\u2019s arguments with respect to the Terminals, the exterior deck area, and fuel.\nThe Terminals\n[188] As discussed previously, under the Appellant\u2019s methodology, the Terminals are part of the common areas. The Appellant\u2019s methodology is based solely on the areas of the Vessels that are used exclusively to make taxable supplies and the areas that are used exclusively to make exempt supplies. As a result, when using the Appellant\u2019s methodology to determine a percentage, the size of the common areas (areas that contribute to the making of both taxable and exempt supplies) is irrelevant. The Appellant argues that this includes the Vessels\u2019 common areas, all areas of the Terminals and the areas of the Appellant\u2019s corporate offices.\n[189] If one accepts that the Terminals and corporate offices were common areas, then as discussed previously, the various areas of the Appellant\u2019s three Terminals and its corporate offices do not affect the percentages determined under its methodology.\n[190] In the Appellant\u2019s view, the Terminals only exist to support the operations of the Vessels; the Terminals provide the infrastructure required to support all operations of the Vessels, both exempt and taxable.\n[191] The Respondent\u2019s position has changed significantly since the Minister issued her assessments. In counsel for the Respondent\u2019s words, the Minister ignored the Terminals when assessing the Appellant. This is not correct. For the periods covered by the First Appeal, the Minister assessed the Appellant by using the Appellant\u2019s methodology to calculate the percentages of 15.57% and 17.20% and then applied these percentages to all of the GST paid by the Appellant on non\u2011fuel inputs, which would include the GST paid on costs incurred in respect of the Terminals. As a result, the Minister, when assessing the Appellant, treated the Terminals as common areas.\n[192] During the February 2023 Proceedings, counsel for the Respondent noted that the Terminals did not factor into these appeals as an issue until the Respondent filed her replies.\n[193] In her replies, the Respondent pleads additional facts with respect to the Terminals that he intended to rely on at the hearing of the appeals. One of these additional facts is that the ferry terminals, terminal parking and boarding areas were part of the single exempt supply of the ferry service of transporting motor and passenger vehicles. It appears to me that these additional facts are only referring to a portion of the space occupied by the Terminals, namely, to the areas that passengers use when boarding the Vessels, and not to the areas in the Terminals used to service the Vessels, such as the warehouses, stevedore buildings, maintenance buildings, and fuel depot.\n[194] However, paragraphs 43 to 61 and paragraphs 138 to 139 of the Respondent\u2019s written submissions make it clear that when referring to the Terminals, the Respondent is now referring to all of the space occupied by the Terminals. The Respondent\u2019s final position is summarized at paragraph 161 of his written submissions as follows:\n\u2026 On a proper determination, substantially all of the Terminal expenses are direct inputs to MAI\u2019s [the Appellant\u2019s] exempt supply of transporting people, cars and commercial freight. As such, when the Terminal areas are properly accounted for as exempt, a fair and reasonable method based on square metre measurement results in a Ratio that is less than 10% such that no ITCs are available. That Ratio applies across the board, including to expenses incurred for fuel.\n[195] At paragraph 126 of her written submissions, the Respondent argues that the Appellant did not consider the different areas within the Terminals, but merely assumed them to be wholly \u201ccommon\u201d without any analysis of that proposition. He argues that as a result, the Appellant\u2019s methodology was not consistently applied.\n[196] Prior to the February 2023 Proceedings, I instructed the parties that they were not to introduce new arguments. During the proceedings, counsel for the Respondent raised an argument that was different from an argument set out in her written submissions.\n[197] As I just noted, at paragraph 161 of her written submissions, the Respondent states that when the Terminals are properly accounted for, the Appellant is not entitled to any input tax credits. However, during the February 2023 Proceedings, in response to my query of whether it was fair and reasonable for the Appellant to be denied all input tax credits, counsel for the Respondent argued that it is not certain that the Appellant would be denied all input tax credits. She returned to the Respondent\u2019s position contained in the Reply, namely that only a portion of the terminal areas was used exclusively to make exempt supplies.[37] It is not clear to me if counsel for the Respondent made this argument in her original oral submissions. Regardless, my reasons indirectly address this argument by my factual finding that the Appellant\u2019s application of its methodology in a way that treated the Terminals as common areas was fair and reasonable.\nThe Court\u2019s Finding With Respect to the Terminals\n[198] The Appellant\u2019s methodology assumes that the Appellant used the Terminals indirectly to make both taxable and exempt supplies on the Vessels.\n[199] Mr. Hupman and Mr. Leamon explained, in some detail, the purpose and use of the various components of the Terminals.\n[200] As noted previously, the Appellant has year-round terminals in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia. It has a seasonal terminal in Argentia, Newfoundland.\n[201] The Appellant does not own any of the Terminals. The Terminals are owned by the Canadian government. Mr. Hupman testified that the Appellant was the custodian of the Terminals. It does not pay any rent to the federal government.\n[202] Mr. Hupman explained the use of the various areas of the Terminals. Tab 12 of Exhibit A-1 sets out each of the specific areas referred to by Mr. Hupman and each area\u2019s size. As discussed previously, the Appellant did not measure the areas of the Terminals when calculating its percentages. It only measured the areas after it filed its appeals, in satisfaction of an undertaking given during discovery in these appeals.\n[203] The terminals in Port aux Basques and North Sydney are large. The Port aux Basques terminal is situated on 121,660 square metres of land, while the North Sydney terminal is situated on 100,423 square metres of land. The Argentia terminal is much smaller, using only 36,037 metres of land.\n[204] Each of the Terminals has a terminal building. In Port aux Basques and North Sydney, the terminal buildings comprise a small portion of the total area of the Terminals: 1.2% in Port aux Basques (1,527 square metres) and 1% in North Sydney (912 square meters). The seasonal terminal building in Argentia accounts for 4% of the total terminal (1,588 square metres).\n[205] The terminal buildings have facilities for the passengers, including washrooms, waiting rooms, seasonal information kiosks occupied by employees of either Newfoundland or Nova Scotia, gift shops and cafeterias. Third parties, who pay rent to the Appellant, operate the gift shops and cafeterias.\n[206] Mr. Hupman explained the use of the other structures on the terminal land as follows:\n-The terminal in North Sydney has a maintenance building (1,249 square metres), while the terminal in Port aux Basques has a maintenance and warehouse building (2,164 square metres). The maintenance buildings supported the operation of the Terminals. The warehouse stored the various items that were consumed on the Vessels on a daily basis. Mr. Hupman noted that this included such things as cleaning supplies, materials, beer, liquor and food (basically, any item that was required on the Vessels on a regular basis).\n-A tank farm (7,738 square metres), used to fuel the Vessels, is located at the Port aux Basques terminal. It is composed of fuel tanks that store the necessary fuel and the facilities required to transfer the fuel to the Vessels. It is protected from spillage by a berm area. The area also has a pumphouse (221 square metres), which is used to provide fuel to vehicles used in dock operations.\n-The terminal in North Sydney has a storage area (2,624 square metres) that is used to store equipment needed for the loading\/unloading process.\n-The terminal in North Sydney has an administration building (1,526 square metres). The administrative staff use this building to support the operations of the Vessels.\n-The Port aux Basques terminal has a small life raft shop (656 square metres) that maintains the Appellant\u2019s marine evacuation system.\n-Each of the Terminals has a stevedore building (367 square metres in Port aux Basques, 251 square metres in North Sydney and 801 square meters in Argentia); these buildings are used to manage the loading and unloading of the Vessels.\n-Each of the Terminals has a ticket booth (445 square metres in Port aux Basques, 280 square metres in North Sydney and 132 square metres in Argentia). Passengers obtain their tickets or cabin keys at the ticket booths. North Sydney also has a small security booth (113 square metres), which secures access to the facilities. Passengers may or may not go through a security screening. Typically, approximately 3% of the passengers\/vehicles are chosen on a random basis for screening.\n-Each of the Terminals has a dock and a traffic ramps area. The docks use 10,130 square metres of the measured space at the Port aux Basques terminal, 20,530 square metres of the measured space at the North Sydney terminal and 2,318 square metres at the Argentia terminal. The Vessels were secured at the docks to allow passengers and vehicles to be loaded and offloaded. The traffic ramps use 1,742 square metres of the measured space at the Port aux Basques terminal and 5,429 square metres at the North Sydney terminal. The traffic ramps are the means by which the Appellant connects the Vessels to the docks.\n[207] The measured areas at the Terminals included the following three areas, which did not contain any physical structures:\n-The area of each terminal that contained green spaces, roadways and access ways. These areas comprised over 50% of the measured area at the Port aux Basques and Argentia terminals and approximately 45% of the measured areas at the North Sydney terminal; these areas measured 64,884 square metres in Port aux Basques, 45,424 square metres in North Sydney and 20,076 square metres in Argentia.\n-The marshalling area for live traffic and drop trailers. These areas accounted for 25,557 square metres in Port aux Basques, 19,445 square metres in North Sydney and 8,785 square metres in Argentia. This is where the vehicles stopped before driving onto the Vessels. The marshalling area for live traffic was for both passenger vehicles and commercial tractor-trailers. The marshalling area for drop trailers was where customers left the drop trailers.\n-The visitor and staff parking areas. These areas take up 6,229 square metres in Port aux Basques, 2,640 square metres in North Sydney and 2,303 square metres in Argentia.\n[208] Mr. Hupman stated that the purpose of the Appellant\u2019s operations at the Terminals was to provide support for the Vessels. He noted that the operations on the Vessels accounted for nearly all of the Appellant\u2019s revenue and a good portion of its expenses. Mr. Hupman\u2019s testimony was supported by the testimony of Mr. Leamon, who stated that 95% of the Appellant\u2019s total revenue arose from the operation of the Vessels.[38]\n[209] Using the numbers provided in the Appellant\u2019s financial statements, Mr. Leamon gave a breakdown of where the Appellant incurred the majority of the expenses in respect of which it claimed input tax credits. Mr. Leamon provided the following evidence regarding the HST paid in respect of the acquisition of fuel; expenses incurred for materials, supplies and services; and expenses incurred for repairs and maintenance:\n-98% of fuel purchases related to the Vessels and the remaining 2% related to the Terminals;\n-90% of expenses for repairs and maintenance related to the Vessels and the remaining 10% related to the Terminals; and\n-57% of expenses for materials, supplies and services related to the Vessels, 26% related to the corporate headquarters and the remaining 17% related to the Terminals.[39]\n[210] Tab B of the appendices to the Appellant\u2019s argument correctly summarizes Mr. Leamon\u2019s testimony. It shows that the evidence before the Court is that 86.54% of the noted expenses in respect of which the Appellant claimed input tax credits were incurred in respect of the Vessels, 7.59% were incurred in respect of the Terminals and 5.87% were incurred in respect of the Appellant\u2019s head office.\n[211] In the Appellant\u2019s view, everything it owns and everything it does is geared towards delivering the taxable and exempt services provided on board the Vessels. This includes the operations at the Terminals and at the Appellant\u2019s corporate offices.\n[212] I agree with the Appellant.\n[213] Section 141.01 requires the Appellant to attribute all costs that it incurred in the course of its business of transporting persons and vehicles by ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to the making of supplies.\n[214] With the exception of renting concession space in the Terminals, the Appellant made no supplies at the Terminals. The exempt supply of the ferry service and the various taxable supplies made on the Vessels comprise nearly all of the supplies made by the Appellant. The Appellant made all of these supplies on the Vessels.\n[215] As a result, the Appellant was required to allocate all of the costs incurred within the Terminals to the supplies made on the Vessels.[40] Neither the Appellant nor the Respondent identified any goods or services that were purchased for use or consumption within the Terminals that could be directly traced to a specific supply made on the Vessels. All of the goods or services were consumed or used indirectly in the making of the supplies on the Vessels.\n[216] The question before the Court is whether these costs were, as the Appellant argues, incurred indirectly in the course of making both taxable and exempt supplies, or whether all of the costs were, as the Respondent argues, incurred indirectly in the course of making the exempt supply of the ferry service.\n[217] In my view, the evidence before the Court leads to the conclusion that the indirect costs incurred at the Terminals supported all supplies made on the Vessels, both the taxable and the exempt supplies. The costs are similar to the so-called infrastructure costs incurred on the Vessels.\n[218] For example, the warehouse stored items consumed on the Vessels; the tank farm supplied the fuel consumed on the Vessels, fuel that was consumed in the making of both taxable and exempt supplies and the administration building housed staff who supported the operation of the Vessels.\n[219] No supplies, taxable or exempt, would be made on the Vessels unless the passengers were able to board the Vessels. Therefore, the docks, traffic ramps, terminal buildings, and ticket booths all supported both the taxable and exempt supplies made on the Vessels in the same way that the corridors, hallways and other general areas on the Vessels allowed the passengers to enter the ship and access the general seating area, the upgraded seating area, the cabins, the restaurants and the bars. The Respondent has conceded that the corridors and hallways and other general areas of the Vessels were used indirectly in the making of both taxable and exempt supplies.\n[220] The Respondent is asking the Court to treat the total area of the Terminals as space used exclusively in the making of exempt supplies. Such a conclusion would result in the Appellant not being entitled to claim any input tax credits. In addition to that conclusion not being supported by the evidence, it would lead to an unreasonable result.\n[221] The Terminals make up between 70% and 83% of the total of the areas of the Vessels and the Terminals. However, only 7.59% of the funds that the Appellant spent on expenses during the relevant periods related to expenses incurred in respect of the Terminals. The Respondent\u2019s position would result in the denial of input tax credits based solely on the relatively large size of the Terminals\u2019 areas even though such areas consumed or used less than 10% (by value) of the inputs that the Appellant consumed or used in the making of supplies.\n[222] Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s position is unreasonable since it does not reflect the business activities of the Appellant, particularly the activities of the Appellant that consumed or used the taxable inputs.\n[223] Regardless, I have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before the Court, that, as assumed by the Minister when assessing the Appellant, all of the areas of the Terminals were common areas for purposes of the Appellant\u2019s methodology.\nOutside Deck\/Seating Area\n[224] The Appellant treated the outside deck\/seating area as common space. The Appellant views it as being similar to the interior corridors and hallways: support for all passengers who are on the Vessels, including those in cabins and the premium seats.\n[225] Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that the treatment of the outside deck\/seating area has a minimal impact on the percentage determined under the Appellant\u2019s methodology. She argues that since the outside deck\/seating area contains places where passengers may sit, it should be treated in the same manner as the regular seating that exists inside the Vessels\u2013in other words, as an area that is used exclusively to make an exempt supply.\n[226] I do not agree.\n[227] The outside deck contains space where the passengers may go for fresh air or to view the ocean or ports. Mr. Hupman noted that the outside area is closed in adverse conditions, such as rough seas, snow or ice.\n[228] The outside deck has some benches where passengers may sit. Mr. Hupman explained that these benches are not included when determining a vessel\u2019s passenger capacity. He explained that one of the items that is used to determine a vessel\u2019s passenger capacity is available seating. This is based on the interior seating only; the outside benches are not included in this calculation.\n[229] The Appellant provided the Court with photographs showing the outside seating and the interior seating.[41] These photographs illustrate that the outside seats are plastic benches. They are not the cushioned seats that can be found in the interior general sitting area. The general seating and day\/night seating are comfortable seats similar to seats one may find on an airplane or train. The outside seats are similar to benches one may find in an outdoor park.\n[230] In my view, the outside deck, which includes areas where the benches are located is part of the infrastructure of the Vessels in the same way that the interior hallways and corridors are part of the infrastructure of the ships; areas that the Respondent has conceded should be treated as common areas.\nFuel\n[231] The Vessels\u2019 main engines, auxiliary engines and boilers consume fuel. The main engines are engaged when the Vessels are moving. They are used to propel the Vessels and produce electricity, heat and hot water. The main engines are not engaged when the Vessels are dockside. The auxiliary engines are only engaged when the Vessels are alongside the dock. They are not used to propel the Vessels. When the Vessels are sailing between Terminals, the auxiliary engines are turned off.\n[232] The Appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that the taxable operations had a significant impact on the fuel consumed on the Vessels because of their consumption of electricity and hot water, the need to heat and cool the spaces that were used to make the taxable supplies, and the need to increase the size of the main engine on account of the weight added to the Vessels as a result of the additional space and equipment required to make the taxable supplies.\n[233] When the Vessels were sailing the main engines generated the electricity consumed on the Vessels by turning shaft alternators. The auxiliary engines generated the electricity when the Vessels were docked. Emergency generators also generated electricity; however, they were used infrequently.\n[234] The electricity was used in the various areas of the Vessels, powering such things as light fixtures, appliances, machines and air conditioners. Since the main engines and the auxiliary engines generated the electricity, fuel was consumed when producing the electricity.\n[235] The main engines also generated the heat that was used when the Vessels were sailing. Mr. Hupman explained that, when running, the main engines generate a great deal of hot air. The Vessels have an exhaust system that contains a technology called economizers, which operates as a heat-capture system. The captured heat is redistributed throughout the Vessels.\n[236] The second source of heat was the Vessels\u2019 fuel-fired boilers. They were used to generate heat when the Vessels were docked and the main engines were turned off.\n[237] When the Vessels were sailing, the main engines provided the hot water used by the Vessels. In addition to capturing heat, the economizer system captured hot water. When the Vessels were docked, the hot water was provided by the fuel\u2011fired boilers.\n[238] It is clear from the evidence before me that the operations carried out on the Vessels to make the taxable supplies consumed a significant amount of electricity, heat and hot water.\n[239] The approximately 100 passenger cabins on the Vessels consumed a significant amount of electricity, heat and hot water. The cabins were basically hotel rooms, with electricity required to power lights, televisions, air conditioners, small appliances and whatever devices the passengers brought into the rooms to use or recharge. Each passenger cabin had its own washroom with a shower, which consumed a good deal of hot water. Each cabin also had its own HVAC system, meaning that a guest could control the heating and air conditioning in the cabin.\n[240] Mr. Hupman testified that 50% of the crew on board a vessel worked directly in the areas that made taxable supplies. Crew cabins were required for each of the crewmembers.\n[241] He noted that crew cabins were similar to the passenger cabins and thus had the same impact on the operating systems of the Vessels, particularly with respect to the consumption of electricity, heat and hot water. However, since the crew cabins were the person\u2019s home away from home, the cabins contained a few extra features. These included mini-fridges and a higher electrical outage to allow for the use of various other appliances and devices. As a result, the electrical load in the crew cabins was higher than the load in the passenger cabins.\n[242] The taxable supplies made by the various catering services also consumed a significant amount of electricity, heat and hot water. Mr. Hupman testified that heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems must be designed around the catering services.\n[243] The catering supplies were made through the Vessels\u2019 dining rooms, cafeterias, bars and snack bars when providing food and drinks to 600 to 700 passengers during the six- to eight-hour journey between Port aux Basques and North Sydney and the 16 hour journey between Argentia and North Sydney. All of the areas where the passengers consumed food and drink were heated and had air conditioning.\n[244] The kitchen\/galley supported the dining, drinking and eating areas.\n[245] Mr. Hupman testified that the kitchen\/galley consumed a large amount of electricity. All of the equipment that is in the kitchen\/galley runs on electricity. The electricity load on ovens and heaters was very high. The kitchen\/galley also consumed a significant amount of hot water. Further, a galley becomes very hot in the summer and thus consumes a considerable amount of cold air from the air conditioners.\n[246] He noted that the catering services require a great deal of storage space, including cold storage areas and freezer\/cooler storage areas for food. All of these areas consume electricity and, with the exception of the freezer\/cooler area, heat.\n[247] Mr. Hupman noted that the heating and air conditioning is distributed throughout the Vessels, as is the lighting. It other words, fuel is used to produce heat, cold air and lighting that is consumed in the other areas of the ships that were used exclusively to make taxable supplies, such as the reserved seating, retail stores, kennels, and arcade areas.\n[248] Similarly, the heat and electricity produced by the engines was consumed in all of the common areas of the Vessels. These areas supported the making of both taxable supplies and exempt supplies.\n[249] In summary, fuel was consumed by the main and auxiliary engines when the engines produced heat, electricity and hot water that was consumed or used directly or indirectly in the making of taxable supplies. The impact on the electrical load was clearly significant.\n[250] The taxable operations also affected the fuel consumption on account of the size of the area required to provide the operations. Mr. Hupman explained this as follows:\n\u2026 The smaller the boat, the smaller the motor, the less fuel you\u2019re going to burn. Once you start working on taxable operations and taxable services, you start to make a lot more space requirements, it\u2019s going to be a much larger vessel, it\u2019s going to be a heavier vessel, it\u2019s going to require a larger engine and therefore it\u2019s going to require more fuel. So there\u2019s a direct nexus between the cost of the fuel to the cost of operating the taxable operations on board.[42]\n[251] The evidence before the Court supports his comments. The fact that the cabins, restaurants, galleys and arcades consumed a significant amount of electricity, heat and hot water meant that the Vessels required larger engines to produce these resources, resulting in heavier Vessels.\n[252] Mr. Hupman noted that the cabins take up a great deal of space that needs to be lit, heated and cooled. Normally, two or three people occupy this space. If the same area was used for general seating, 40 to 50 people could be accommodated. Further, in Mr. Hupman\u2019s words, the cabins added a significant amount of weight to the ship. The additional weight was a major design concern. He noted that the more weight that is added by the cabins, the bigger that the systems, including the engines, must be in order to manage the cabins and to propel the Vessels.\n[253] The catering services also added considerable weight to the Vessels. In addition to the significant area occupied by the eating areas and the galley, the catering services were supported by a number of storage areas that also took up a good deal of space. This includes the areas occupied by cold storage, freezer\/cooler storage and bulk stores.\n[254] Mr. Hupman noted that it is not possible to directly measure the amount of fuel consumed in the making of taxable supplies and the amount consumed in the making of exempt supplies. In response to the question \u201c[I]s it possible to measure \u2026 the consumption of fuel that results from the taxable operations on the vessel?\u201d, Mr. Hupman stated the following:\nNo, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not possible to break that down and measure the individual pieces that would go to the different taxable operations. You\u2019ve got one engine or two engines and those engines are basically providing supply to a multitude of outlets. And in this case the main engines would also be providing propulsion. So there\u2019s no way to actually determine how you would actually figure out what goes specifically to a certain outlet. That is not a possibility.\nYou need heat or you need power, you turn the engine on and the engine burns fuel. And if it\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s still burning the fuel. You still need the engine going to actually provide the service. So it\u2019s -- no, there's no way to calculate that.[43]\n[255] I accept Mr. Hupman\u2019s testimony on this point. Both he and Mr. Leamon were consistent on this point, including when tested on cross-examination.\n[256] Since it is not possible to directly measure the amount of fuel consumed in the making of taxable or exempt supplies, the Appellant must use an allocation method.\n[257] It is the Appellant\u2019s position that since the main engines of the Vessels were used to propel the Vessels and to generate electricity, heat and hot water, they were used in both taxable and exempt activities. Therefore, the fuel consumed by the main engines was acquired, in part, for consumption or use in the course of the Appellant\u2019s commercial activities. The Appellant also argues that the fuel consumed by the auxiliary engines was also acquired, in part, for consumption or use in the course of its commercial activities. This is the result since the auxiliary engines provided electricity, heat and hot water when the Vessels were dockside.\n[258] The Appellant argues that the cost of the fuel should be treated in the same manner as the other direct and indirect costs incurred by the Appellant: it should be allocated to taxable supplies using the Appellant\u2019s methodology.\n[259] Similar to his position with respect to other issues, the Respondent\u2019s position with respect to fuel has changed over time.\n[260] As discussed previously, the Minister, when assessing the Appellant for the reporting periods covered by the First Appeal, allowed input tax credits equal to 12.456% and 13.76% of the HST that the Appellant paid in respect of fuel purchased for use in the Vessels\u2019 auxiliary engines during its reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2009 and April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively. She did not allow any input tax credits for HST paid on fuel purchased during these periods for use in the Vessels\u2019 main engines.\n[261] She did not allow any input tax credits in respect of the HST paid on fuel that the Appellant acquired during the periods covered by the Second Appeal.\n[262] The Respondent now argues that the Minister made a mistake when allowing any input tax credits in respect of the fuel purchased by the Appellant. He argues that all fuel consumed and used by the Appellant was a direct cost of, and was attributable to, its exempt supply of the ferry transportation service. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the fuel did not contribute to the Appellant\u2019s commercial activities.[44]\n[263] The Respondent raises the following additional arguments in support of his current position that the Appellant is not entitled to claim input tax credits for the HST that it incurred when acquiring fuel:\n-He argues that if the percentage determined by the Appellant\u2019s methodology is below 10%, then the Appellant cannot claim input tax credits on any of its inputs, including fuel.\n-However, if the percentage determined by the Appellant\u2019s methodology exceeds 9%, the Respondent argues that the percentage should not be applied to the fuel inputs. The input tax credits with respect to the HST paid on the acquisition of the fuel should be calculated separately from the input tax credits on all other indirect expenses. He argues that regardless of the percentage determined under the Appellant\u2019s methodology, the Appellant is not entitled to claim any input tax credits in respect of the HST that it paid on the acquisition of fuel.\n-He also argues that the Appellant has led no evidence to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption that more than 90% of the fuel consumed by the engines on the Appellant\u2019s Vessels was for the provision of exempt supplies. As a result, subsection 141(3) deems that all of the fuel used on the Vessels was for the provision of exempt supplies. As part of this argument, the Respondent argues that the Appellant was responsible for the erroneous assumptions made by the CRA with respect to the fuel consumed by the Appellant.\n-He also argues that judicial comity should apply since the same issue of fuel input tax credits was decided in B.C. Ferries.\n[264] It is clear from the evidence before the Court that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position, the Appellant used the fuel directly and indirectly in the making of both taxable and exempt supplies. There is no evidence before the Court to support the Respondent\u2019s position that the fuel was only used in the making of exempt supplies.\n[265] Since it is impossible to determine the actual amount of fuel that was consumed by the engines to propel the Vessels and the actual amount of fuel that was consumed to produce electricity, heat and hot water, an allocation method must be used to make such a determination.\n[266] Having found that the Appellant\u2019s methodology is a fair and reasonable method to allocate direct and indirect costs between taxable and exempt supplies, I see no reason why it should not be used for all costs incurred by the Appellant, including fuel.\n[267] The evidence before me is that, as a result of the Vessels\u2019 main and auxiliary engines producing electricity, heat and hot water and as a result of the increase in the size of the Vessels and their engines because of the taxable operations, a substantial amount of fuel was consumed as an indirect cost of making the taxable supplies on the Vessels.\n[268] Specifically, fuel was consumed to produce the electricity, heat and hot water consumed in the areas of the Vessels that were used to make taxable supplies. These areas were used by 600 to 700 passengers over a six- to eight-hour journey (16 hours for the seasonal route between North Sydney and Argentia). The passengers used the electricity, heat and hot water directly and indirectly when using the seating, enjoying their cabins, eating and showering.\n[269] There is no perfect allocation method available to determine how much fuel was actually consumed as an indirect input in the making of the taxable supplies. The evidence is that it is impossible to separately measure the fuel that was consumed by the engines to propel the Vessels and the fuel that was consumed by the engines to produce electricity, heat and hot water. This is not uncommon when dealing with indirect costs. It is the reason that most GST registrants must develop an allocation method.\n[270] As noted previously, the Appellant\u2019s allocation method, which is based on the use of the various areas of the Vessels, is a fair and reasonable method to estimate the use made of the various inputs consumed or used by the Appellant during the relevant periods. The Appellant has chosen to use this method for both direct and indirect costs. There is no reason why it should not be used for fuel, which is a substantial indirect input in the making of taxable supplies, especially since the evidence indicates that there is a direct correlation between the areas of the Vessels used to made taxable supplies and the amount of fuel consumed to produce electricity, heat and hot water.\n[271] The Respondent did not adduce any relevant evidence to counter the Appellant\u2019s evidence. He relies solely on the assumptions made in his replies, assumptions that been destroyed by the Appellant, his cross-examination of the Appellant\u2019s witnesses and an excise tax audit that occurred four years before the periods at issue. I will discuss each of these points shortly.\n[272] Counsel for the Respondent suggested that an expert might be able to determine the actual amount of fuel that was consumed by the engines to propel the Vessels and the actual amount of fuel that was consumed to produce electricity, heat and hot water. This is speculation and would have caused the Appellant to incur substantial costs. In my view, if the Respondent considers that an expert could make that determination, then he should have retained such an expert and provided this person\u2019s report to the Court.\n[273] The Respondent\u2019s argument that if the percentage determined by the Appellant is below 10%, then the Appellant cannot claim input tax credits on any of its inputs, including fuel, is moot since the percentage is above 10%.\n[274] Further, his argument that if the percentage is 10% or higher, it should not be applied to fuel breaches paragraph 141.01(5)(b) since that would mean that the methodology is not being used consistently. The Appellant\u2019s methodology would only be applied if it produced the result desired by the Respondent. If it did not produce the desired result, then another method would be used.\n[275] It is not clear to me what allocation method the Respondent proposes to use if the fuel is dealt with separately from all other direct or indirect costs. The Respondent did not put any evidence before the Court with respect to an alternative allocation method for fuel, other than assuming that no input tax credit is allowed for HST paid on the fuel purchases. Regardless, the law is clear: the CRA cannot simply substitute its method for that of the Appellant. The Appellant is entitled to use any method that is fair and reasonable provided that it complies with the provisions of the GST Act. I have already found that the Appellant\u2019s methodology is fair and reasonable and complies with the GST Act.\n[276] I do not agree with counsel for the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Appellant has led no evidence to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption that more than 90% of the fuel consumed by the engines on the Appellant\u2019s Vessels was for the provision of exempt supplies. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s evidence destroyed the assumption.\n[277] Indeed, I have found, on the basis of the evidence before me, that less than 90% of the fuel was consumed by the engines of the Appellant\u2019s Vessels for the provision of exempt supplies.\n[278] The Respondent\u2019s Reply \u2013 First Appeal notes at paragraphs 19(ll) to (ww) twelve assumptions that the Minister made with respect to fuel when determining the Appellant\u2019s net tax. Four of these assumptions refer to the 12.456% and 13.76% used to determine input tax credits for HST paid on fuel consumed by the auxiliary engines. The remaining eight assumptions relate to the Minister\u2019s denial of input tax credits for HST paid on the fuel consumed by the main engines. These assumptions are:\nll) the Vessels each had a separate auxiliary generator used to produce heat and electricity and to operate the Vessels;\nmm) the auxiliary generators operated separately from the main engines used for propulsion of the Vessels;\nnn) the main engines on the Vessels consumed and used a different fuel than the auxiliary generators;\n\u2026\nss) fuel consumed for propulsion was directly related to the exempt ferry service of transporting motor vehicles and passengers;\ntt) less than 10% of the fuel consumed and used by the main engines was attributable to the provision of taxable services;\nuu) more than 90% of the fuel consumed and used by the main engines was attributable to the provision of exempt services;\nvv) it was not fair and reasonable to not remove the tax on the fuel consumed and used by the main engines from the tax base prior to applying the indirect allocation ratio to calculate the indirect ITCs; and\nww) it was fair and reasonable to remove the tax on the fuel consumed and used by the main engines from the tax base prior to applying the indirect allocation ratio to calculate the indirect ITCs.\n[279] The same eight assumptions were made in the Reply \u2013 Second Appeal, except that the words in tt) and uu) \u201cused by the main engines\u201d were replaced with the words \u201cused by the Vessels\u201d and the words in vv) and ww) \u201cconsumed and used by the main engines\u201d were deleted. As a result, these assumptions applied to both the main engines and the auxiliary engines, meaning, that for the periods covered by the Second Appeal, the Minister assessed on the basis that no input tax credits were allowed for fuel regardless of whether the fuel was consumed in the main engines or the auxiliary engines.\n[280] First, I note that assumptions vv) and ww) are not assumptions of fact; they are assumptions of mixed fact and law. They are in fact argument.\n[281] Assumptions ll) and mm) state that the main engines were only used to propel the Vessels and that the auxiliary engines were used to produce the electricity and heat and to \u201coperate the Vessels\u201d. The Appellant\u2019s evidence destroyed each of these assumptions.\n[282] As discussed, the main engines propelled the Vessels and generated the electricity and heat. They also generated hot water. The auxiliary engines were not used when the main engines were engaged; they were only used when the Vessels were dockside.\n[283] The Minister\u2019s assumption that more than 90% of the fuel consumed and used by the main engines was attributable to the provision of exempt supplies is a factual conclusion that is based on the false assumptions that the main engines were only used to propel the Vessels and that the auxiliary engines produced the electricity and heat when the Vessels were sailing. In my view, by demolishing the assumptions that the main engines were only used to propel the Vessels and that the electricity and heat were provided by the auxiliary engines, the Appellant also demolished the factual conclusion based on these assumptions that more than 90% of the fuel consumed and used by the main engines was attributable to the provision of exempt supplies.\n[284] In addition, I find that the Appellant\u2019s factual evidence with respect to the consumption of electricity, heat and hot water on the Vessels also demolished the Minister\u2019s factual assumption.\n[285] The Respondent spent a great deal of time arguing about the cause of the Minister\u2019s false assumption that the main engines on the Vessels consumed and used a different fuel than the auxiliary generators. I fail to see how the type of fuel used in the engines has any relevance when determining the use made of the main engines and the auxiliary engines. It appears that this issue was only relevant when the Respondent assumed that the auxiliary engines provided all of the electricity, heat and hot water; this assumption has been destroyed by the Appellant.\n[286] With respect to the issue of judicial comity, I would first note that judicial comity relates to questions of law. The question of the extent to which the Appellant acquired the fuel for consumption or use in the course of its commercial activities is a question of fact. The facts in the B.C. Ferries appeal are substantially different from the facts in the appeals before the Court. Further, in the B.C. Ferries appeal, the appellant made two admissions that Justice Campbell relied on when deciding that the appellant was not entitled to input tax credits in respect of the fuel. The first was an admission made in the agreed statement of facts filed in that appeal that substantially all of the fuel that was consumed was for propulsion. The second was an admission made by the appellant that it was unable to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that over 10% of the fuel was consumed directly in the provision of the vessel\u2019s commercial activities.\n[287] The Appellant made no such admissions in the current appeals that are before the Court. In fact, the Appellant\u2019s witnesses explained in some detail why they are of the opinion that over 10% of the fuel was consumed directly or indirectly in the provision of the Vessels\u2019 commercial activities.\n[288] I have also considered the evidence given by Mr. Leamon with respect to the Appellant\u2019s excise tax refunds. In my view, the method used by the Appellant to calculate refunds of excise tax paid on fuel is irrelevant for purposes of determining the Appellant\u2019s net tax under the GST Act. Further, Mr. Leamon\u2019s testimony with respect to the fuel tax refunds did not in anyway contradict either his own or Mr. Hupman\u2019s testimony with respect to the Appellant\u2019s consumption or use of fuel in the course of its commercial activities.\nOther Concessions\n[289] Immediately prior to the February 2023 Proceedings, the parties each made a concession. The concessions were made in a letter to the Court dated February 24, 2023 that was signed by both parties.\n[290] The Respondent informed the Court that he was not pursuing an argument that he had made in his written submissions that the Appellant\u2019s revised input tax credit claims are statute-barred.\n[291] The Appellant informed the Court that it was not pursuing the argument that the Minister is statute-barred from adjusting the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the public service body rebate under section 259 of the GST Act in the event that the Court finds for the Appellant in respect of the input tax credit claims.\nConclusion\n[292] For the foregoing reasons, the appeals are allowed with costs. The reassessments are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that, for each reporting period of the Appellant ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2011, the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits are to be determined by applying the Appellant\u2019s Final Percentage of 24.52% to the total amount of HST that was paid or payable by the Appellant in the specific period, and for each reporting period of the Appellant ending between April 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012, the Appellant\u2019s input tax credits are to be determined by applying the Appellant\u2019s Final Percentage of 18.11% to the total amount of HST that was paid or payable by the Appellant in the specific period. Such input tax credits shall be used to calculate the Appellant\u2019s net tax for each of the relevant periods and its entitlement to the public service body rebate under section 259 of the GST Act.\n[293] The parties have 60 days from the date of this judgment to make written representations with respect to the amount of costs that the Court should award the Appellant. The written submissions shall not exceed 15 pages. If no submissions are received, costs shall be awarded to the Appellant as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Antigonish, Nova Scotia, this 10th day of July 2023.\n\u201cS. D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nAppendix A\nUniversity of Calgary v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 321\nParagraphs 94-109 (footnotes included)\n[94] The application of subsection 169(1) to tax paid on property or services acquired by a registrant in the course of its business for consumption or use directly in the making of a specific supply is relatively straightforward. For example, if the registrant acquires the property or service only for consumption or use directly in the making of a taxable supply, then the property is consumed or used in the course of the registrant\u2019s commercial activity and the registrant is entitled to claim a full input tax credit for the tax paid on the acquisition of the property or service. Alternatively, no input tax credit is available if the registrant acquires the property or service solely for consumption or use directly in the making of exempt supplies.\n[95] The application of subsection 169(1) to \u201cindirect costs\u201d, that is, property and services that are not used directly in the making of a taxable or an exempt supply, is not as straightforward. When making a determination in this regard, one must consider the section 141.01 input tax credit apportionment rules.\n[96] Indirect costs include such things as administrative costs, overhead costs, and costs incurred in respect of common areas in or around a building. For example, in most instances, the payroll department of a corporation that makes both taxable and exempt supplies will not be involved directly in the making of any supplies by the corporation.\n[97] The expenses of the payroll department are incurred in the course of the registrant\u2019s business. All of the registrant\u2019s business constitutes its commercial activity, except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies. It can be argued that, since the payroll department is not involved directly in the making of exempt supplies, it is not involved in the portion of the registrant\u2019s business that makes the exempt supplies. If this argument were accepted, then all of the payroll department\u2019s activities would be considered to have occurred in the course of the registrant\u2019s commercial activity. Such an interpretation would allow a registrant who makes both taxable and exempt supplies to claim full input tax credits for indirect costs such as costs incurred by its payroll department.\n[98] Parliament addressed this issue when it added section 141.01 in 1994, retroactive to the introduction of the GST. Subsections 141.01(2) and 141.01(3) clarify that, when determining input tax credits for a registrant involved in both taxable and exempt activities, one must attribute all costs of the registrant to the making of supplies.\n[99] Subsection 141.01(2) sets out a deeming rule that applies on the acquisition of property or a service.59 The subsection reads as follows:\nWhere a person acquires or imports property or a service or brings it into a participating province for consumption or use in the course of an endeavour of the person, the person shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to have acquired or imported the property or service or brought it into the province, as the case may be,\n(a) for consumption or use in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the property or service is acquired, imported or brought into the province by the person for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration in the course of that endeavour; and\n(b) for consumption or use otherwise than in the course of commercial activities of the person, to the extent that the property or service is acquired, imported or brought into the province by the person\n(i) for the purpose of making supplies in the course of that endeavour that are not taxable supplies made for consideration, or\n(ii) for a purpose other than the making of supplies in the course of that endeavour.\n[100] Endeavour of a person is defined in subsection 141.01(1) as meaning a business of the person, an adventure or concern in the nature of trade of the person, or the making of a supply of real property of the person.\n[101] For example, the endeavour of a person carrying on a single business is all of the activities of the business, including the making of taxable supplies and the making of exempt supplies.\n[102] Subsection 141.01(2) applies to property or a service acquired60 by the person for consumption or use in the course of the business. Pursuant to paragraph 141.01(2)(a), the person is deemed, for the purposes of the Act, to have acquired the property or service for consumption or use in the course of commercial activities of the person to the extent that the property or service is acquired by the person for the purpose of making taxable supplies for consideration in the course of the business.\n[103] Alternatively, under subparagraph 141.01(2)(b)(i), the person is deemed to have acquired the property or service for consumption or use otherwise than in the course of commercial activities of the person to the extent that the property or service is acquired by the person for the purpose of making supplies in the course of the business that are not taxable supplies made for consideration. Normally, this would be exempt supplies and taxable supplies made for no consideration or nominal consideration.61\n[104] In addition, under subparagraph 141.01(2)(b)(ii), the person is deemed to have acquired the property or service for consumption or use otherwise than in the course of commercial activities of the person to the extent that the property or service is acquired by the person for a purpose other than the making of supplies in the course of the business. This provision applies where a person incurs expenses that do not relate to the person\u2019s business. Normally, such expenses are personal expenses of the owner of the business or a person related to the owner.\n[105] Subsection 141.01(2) looks at the person\u2019s purpose when acquiring the property or service, in other words, the person\u2019s intended consumption or use of the property or service. In particular, it looks to see if the intention was to use the property or service in the making of taxable supplies for consideration, the making of exempt supplies or the making of a combination of such supplies.62 The person is only entitled to claim an input tax credit for tax paid on the property or service to the extent that the person\u2019s intention was to use the property or service in the making of taxable supplies for consideration.\n[106] In my view, if a corporation incurs an expense in the course of its business (endeavour), then the expense will always be incurred for the purpose of making one or more supplies. The purpose of the business is to earn revenue, i.e., to make supplies. Therefore, the result of subsection 141.01(2) is that all costs incurred by a person in the course of the person\u2019s business must be traced to a specific supply or multiple supplies in respect of which the costs were incurred.\n[107] This is a relatively easy exercise for property or services that can be traced directly to the making of a taxable or an exempt supply. The challenge is to trace indirect costs to the various related supplies.\n[108] My view is consistent with the Department of Finance\u2019s February 1994 technical notes, which explain the purpose of section 141.01 with respect to indirect costs as follows:\nMany types of properties and services used in the operation of a business are not directly used in the making of supplies. These may be referred to as \u201cindirect inputs\u201d. Examples include items of overhead and inputs used in the operation of \u201csupport\u201d functions of a business such as a personnel department or an internal audit department. The personnel, management, administrative and other support functions of a business are part of what is involved in the making of supplies since these functions are undertaken in order for the business to achieve the ultimate end or purpose of making supplies. . . .\nNew section 141.01 is added only to reinforce this concept that the ultimate purpose of making supplies of some kind involves all aspects of the business. The section, in effect, requires an attribution of all costs to the making of supplies. . . .\n[Emphasis added.]\n[109] Subsection 141.01(3) contains identical rules, except that it applies to the actual consumption or use of the property or service rather than the intended consumption or use of the property or service on its acquisition. This subsection is relevant when applying provisions of the GST Act that look at the actual use or consumption of property or a service in a specific period, such as the section 206 change-in-use rules.\n___________________________\n59 It also applies on the importation of property or a service.\n60 The subsection also applies to property or services imported into Canada and property or services brought into a participating province.\n61 Under subsection 141.01(4) property or services acquired for the purpose of making a taxable supply for no consideration or nominal consideration may be deemed to have been acquired for the purpose of making a taxable supply for consideration.\n62 In addition to taxable supplies for consideration and exempt supplies, the person may make taxable supplies for no consideration or nominal consideration. Generally speaking, under subsection 141.01(4), such supplies are re-characterized as either taxable supplies for consideration or exempt supplies.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 95\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2012-1765(GST)G\n2015-2123(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMarine Atlantic Inc. v.

Facts [1] The Appellant (\u201cMr. Osborne\u201d) appeals the Minister of National Revenue\u2019s (the \u201cMinister\u201d) reassessment of his 2006 taxation year. In reassessing, penalties under section 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.1 (5th sup.) (the \u201cAct\u201d) were also imposed.\n[2] For context and central to the 2006 reassessment is a charitable donation scheme afoot during 2006-2007 within the Region of Durham. The scheme was authored, or at least effected, by one Fais Khan (\u201cKhan\u201d). Khan offered tax preparation services to taxpayers accompanied by the provision of charitable donation receipts involving certain \u201ccharities\u201d, some of which are described in the chart below. Other details of Khan\u2019s specific actions are otherwise described within, as necessary.\n[3] Accordingly, the reassessment and penalties relate to disallowed charitable donation tax credits. The following summarizes the related claimed charitable donations, utilizing the legal names of the entities on file with the Minister of National Revenue (\u201cMinister\u201d):\nItem #\nCharity\nAmount\n1.\nAve Development Foundation\n$6,003\n2.\nAve Development Foundation\n$6,000\n3.\nPentecostal Assembly Church International\n$10,500\n4.\nThe Mega Church International Inc.\n$11,500\n5.\nDestiny Ministries International Mission\n$9,700\n6.\nPanAfrican Canadian Multicultural Center\n$5,000\n7.\nCity Chapel Ministries International\n$11,300\nWitnesses, testimony and other evidence at the hearing [4] Both Mr. and Mrs. Osborne testified at the hearing. Respondent\u2019s counsel entered Mr. Osborne\u2019s 2006 tax return through cross examination, the charitable donation receipts, as well as the records of the revocation of all the alleged charitable entities and the criminal sentencing decision concerning the fraudster, Khan.\n[5] From that testimony and documentary record, the Court has made the following findings of fact concerning events that unfolded culminating in the reassessments and penalties now appealed.\nReferral of Khan by co-worker [6] Sometime in late 2006, a co-worker of Mrs. Osborne, one Marilyn, mentioned that she and her husband used a Fais Khan as their accountant and tax preparer. This was intially thought to be timely advice. Mr. Osborne\u2019s usual tax preparers were relocating and too busy to attend to the preparation of his 2006 return. Mrs. Osborne took the information and contacted Khan.\nHouse calls: laying the groundwork of deceit\n[7] Upon contact, Khan was more than happy to oblige. He saw Mrs. Osborne 4 or 5 times at the Osborne residence. Mrs. Osborne was taken with the spirituality of Khan, his sense of community spirit and charitable instincts. Mrs. Osborne was and remains a devout Catholic; she identified with Khan\u2019s concern for assisting those in need. Khan presented her with small examples of handicrafts purportedly made by beneficiaries of the various charities. According to Mrs. Osborne, these trinkets illustrated the physical results of the power of charitable gifts.\nKhan demands cash and then accepted cheques\n[8] Khan described for Mrs. Osborne the objects of charitable giving generally. He mentioned in passing names of charities, but the focus was on general charitable giving, the tangible benefits to the recipients and the spiritual growth to the donors, Mr. and Mrs. Osborne. Khan requested sizeable cash sums from Mrs. Osborne to fulfil the commitment. During winter and early spring of 2007, Mrs. Osborne estimates that she gave Khan some $20,000. At first, this was in cash: she would go to her bank, withdraw the cash, return home, and give it to Khan while he waited for her. Soon this became too much effort and Mrs. Osborne indicated she would prefer to write cheques. Khan ultimately compromised. He was willing to receive a cheque, payable to him.\nMrs. Osborne managed family day to day operations\n[9] Both Mr. and Mrs. Osborne confirmed that Mrs. Osborne managed the day-to-day operations of the family household: children, finances, repairs and social engagements. Included within this was the selection of service providers such as tax preparers. The reason for this, was simple: Mr. Osborne\u2019s job took him out of town for weeks at a time. Only Mrs. Osborne had the continued presence to coordinate the procurement and timing necessary to keep the family on track. As described, she \u201ckept the ship afloat\u201d. Mr. Osborne two roles were working his demanding jobs -- there were several in transition at the time -- and coaching baseball for children\u2019s teams, including his own.\nCompletion of 2006 tax return\n[10] In April 2007, tax return time arrived. Khan attended again on Mrs. Osborne to prepare and have the 2006 tax returns finalized. A date was picked when Mr. Osborne was in town (i.e. not on work travel) so that, once completed, he could sign the return. Khan arrived at the residence, reviewed the tax information slips he had requested, and completed the returns for signature.\nNo or little review of tax returns [11] Once the return was completed, Mrs. Osborne summoned Mr. Osborne home from the office. In 3 minutes or so, Mr. Osborne entered the house, was introduced to Khan for the first time, was turned to the signing page and executed the tax return. Mr. Osborne did not review his 2006 tax return. Once signed, the returns were sealed by Khan in stamped envelopes and Mrs. Osborne posted the returns herself. As a portent of things to come, Mr. Osborne said he was underwhelmed by Khan finding him \u201cgreasy\u201d, with a clammy handshake and dodgy manner. While he resolved not to use Khan again, owing the imminently approaching filing deadline, Mr. Osborne filed his 2006 tax return with Khan as the unacknowledged tax preparer.\nPast record of charitable givings [12] In no tax year before 2006, had Mr. Osborne donated more than $300. In 2006, the amount claimed as charitable donations was $60,003. Previous recipients had been the Church, minor sports and the Salvation Army. In 2006, the recipients were recorded as 6 different charities, none of which Mr. Osborne recognized then or during his testimony. Mrs. Osborne had a vague recollection of one or two from initial conversations with Khan, but she was mostly unfamiliar with them.\nThe CRA and police arrive on the Osborne doorstep\n[13] The CRA caught on to Khan in early 2008. As part of that detection, the CRA initiated a search of the Osborne residence. Fifteen people from the CRA and assorted police forces arrived at the Osborne residence in May of 2008. The authorities were on the hunt for copiers, blank charitable receipts and other paraphernalia needed for charity scheme fraud. Children\u2019s piggy banks were opened, Christmas gifts inspected, and personal liberties constrained during the search. The Osbornes were charged with income tax evasion.\nA long and winding road to appeal [14] The toll and grind on the Osbornes have been extreme. They have lasting views of the adverse impact and freely expressed them in Court. They say their treatment at the hands of the CRA has left them weakened, impoverished and despondent. All criminal proceedings were dismissed because of unconstitutional delays. It is quite clear that the Osbornes were large victims of Khan. As well, it seems they fell hard for the Khan \u201ccon\u201d in the first instance. As a result, the Osbornes clung longer to the notion that Khan or the charities would deliver evidence of bona fide receipts for the cash and cheques provided. As an example, while the police and CRA searched the house, Mrs. Osborne desperately called the charities and pleaded for corroboration. The requests went unheeded but not unnoticed. The Osbornes\u2019 pleas were interpreted as complicity by one Lorraine Armstrong of the CRA, who marshalled the criminal prosecution for the CRA.\nMr. Osborne asserts his cooperation was spurned by the CRA\n[15] Mr. Osborne asserts he and his wife assisted the CRA with the investigation once Khan\u2019s fraud was known to them. Further, he asserts that their information and documentation was used by Ms. Armstrong to uncover the deceit. However, it was not received as evidence of the Osbornes\u2019 victimhood but interpreted as a complicit surrender of those involved with something to hide. In contrast, evidence was produced that showed other victims of Khan were allowed by the Minister\u2019s agents to refile returns, minus the charitable donations, with no imposed penalties.\nThe tax evasion charges against the Osbornes [16] The income tax evasion charges against the Osbornes are entirely unrelated to the reassessment at issue before this Court. However, ignoring the charges would be blind to several deeply seared scars borne by the Osbornes to this day, and omnipresent before the Court during the trial. The Court used its continuous, best efforts to convince Mr. Osborne that the facts, legal tests and basis for his liability for any tax assessment and penalties, the issue before this Court, were divorced from his charges, defence and acquittal of income tax evasion. Based upon Mr. Osborne\u2019s continued reference to those charges during the trial and closing argument, the Court admits its failure in that regard. Therefore, these reasons include those assertions which comprised the basis for appeal.\nAppellant\u2019s Grounds for Appeal [17] Mr. Osborne contests the disallowed donations and penalties on the following basis:\n(1) he is an honest, law-abiding person, hoodwinked and \u201cconned\u201d by a convicted criminal;\n(2) the CRA has treated fraud victims of Khan\u2019s fraud unequally;\n(3) Mr. Osborne had no intention to misrepresent, knowingly file a false return or avoid paying income taxes; and,\n(4) he neither anticipated, expected nor suspected the dealings of Khan were fraudulent.\nII. Issues [18] There are two issues to be determined by the Court are:\n(a) is Mr. Osborne entitled to the disallowed charitable tax credits identified in the table at the outset of these reasons?\n(b) are subsection 163(2) penalties warranted either because Mr. Osborne knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence made false statements in his 2006 tax returns?\n[19] At the outset of submissions, Respondent\u2019s counsel resiled from the suggestion that Mr. Osborne knowingly made a false statement on his 2006 tax return.\nPreliminary Issue: alleged conduct of the Minister\u2019s Agents (the \u201cCRA\u201d) [20] As noted, Mr. Osborne alleges that the CRA, and Ms. Lorraine Armstrong, had something \u201cpersonal\u201d against the Osbornes. The CRA believed the Osbornes were complicit with Mr. Khan in the charity scam and conducted themselves like \u201cstorm troopers\u201d. The Minister has treated other taxpayers more advantageously than Mr. Osborne. Further, Mr. Osborne asserts the defence of the criminal charges cost him some $240,000, a goodly portion of his life savings. In short, he believes the Minister\u2019s actions, if not held accountable, should, at least mitigate his continued victimization by the imposition of penalties.\n[21] As explained at the hearing and repeated now, the CRA and Minister\u2019s actions concerning the criminal charges, even if totally unjustified, have no, and cannot have any, legal bearing on the issue of the correctness of the assessment for tax and imposed penalties. The issues, legal tests, facts and considerations are distinct as between criminal behaviour of tax evasion, on one hand, and liability for income tax, on the other, and must remain so[1]. Further, the Minister is not held to a standard of treating one taxpayer the same as or less fairly than another.[2] Lastly, the Court reaffirms for the Osbornes that the liability for tax and penalties under the ITA, at issue before this Court, does not incorporate judgment for bad behaviour, or good for that matter. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is to determine whether the taxpayer is liable to pay tax (and within that determination, entitled to the claimed deductions), and when doing so, has the taxpayer been grossly negligent, as the Minister asserts in this appeal.\nIII. Analysis and Decision (a) Charitable tax credits [22] The issue of whether amounts were actually paid by Mr. Osborne[3] to the charities or whether he had the requisite donative intent[4] will be discussed below. The appeal to claim the donation deductions fails at the outset for a compelling and simple reason: the charitable donation receipts reflecting the alleged donations are deficient.\n[23] Regulations 3500 and 3501[5], referenced in section 118.1 of the Act, provide mandatory, inescapable requirements for the form and content of charitable donation receipts. Receipts must be retained and produced to the Minister in compliant form in order for a successful charitable donation deduction[6] to be made.\nCharitable Receipt\nDeficiency\nSection offended\nDeficiency\nSection offended\nDeficiency\nSection offended\nAve Development Foundation\nIf a portion cash, no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nIf partial Cheque,\nno date or specific receipt dates\n3501(h)\nAve Development Foundation\nIf a portion cash, no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nIf partial Cheque,\nno date or specific receipt dates\n3501(h)\nPentecostal Assembly Church Int\u2019l\nIs a portion ash, no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nNo locality of receipt issuance\n3501(1)(d)\nName incorrect as recorded with Minister\n3501(1)e\nThe Mega Church International\nIf a portion cash, no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nNo locality of receipt issuance\n3501(1)(d)\nDestiny Ministries Int\u2019l Mission\nCash, but no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nNo locality of receipt\n3501(1)(d)\nName incorrect as recorded with Minister\n3501(1)e\nPanAfrican Canadian Multicultural Centre\nCash, but no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nNo locality of receipt\n3501(1)(d)\nName incorrect as recorded with Minister\n3501(1)e\nCity Chapel Ministries International\nCash, but no dates, amounts per date or breakdown\n3501(1)(e)\nNo locality of receipt\n3501(1)(d)\n[24] The following table analyzes each charitable receipt tendered by Mr. Osborne and outlines the multiple bases by which each is deficient and non-compliant with the Act and Regulations:\n[25] Given these deficiencies as to the form and content of the charitable receipts, in the first instance, Mr. Osborne is not entitled to the charitable deductions claimed for the entities listed above.\n[26] Quite apart from this basis for dismissing the appeal, there is another equally compelling ground: there is no evidence Mr. Osborne intended to donate a single dollar to the specific entities above. He could not recall a single name of the purported charities, whether from memory or when such receipts, as attached to his tax return, were placed before him at trial. Mrs. Osborne\u2019s distinct knowledge of the charities\u2019 existence, even as a proxy, was only slightly better than that of Mr. Osborne, and likely arose after the fact. A combination of cash and cheques estimated by Mr. and Mrs. Osborne to total $20,000 was tendered, but never directly to the charities, only exclusively to Khan. Further, receipts 2, 4, 5 and 7 recorded donation dates which occurred before Khan had collected any money from the Osbornes.\n[27] Mr. Osborne, or Mrs. Osborne as his proxy\/agent, never made a gift as contemplated at common law; he or she \u201cpurchased\u201d donation receipts from Khan with grossly inflated values well beyond the cash paid.\n[28] The leading case on the meaning of \u201cgift\u201d is The Queen v. Friedberg[7], where Linden J.A. defined \u201cgift\u201d as:\n...[A] gift is a voluntary transfer of property owned by a donor to a donee, in return for which no benefit or consideration flows to the donor...\n[29] Respondent counsel referred to the case of Coombs et al v. The Queen,[8] where Woods J. referred to the elements of this definition in the following manner:\n... First, it is necessary that the gifted property be owned by the donor, second that the transfer to the charity be voluntary, third that no consideration flow to the donor in return for the gift, and fourth that the subject of the gift be property, which distinguishes it from providing services to the charity. These elements reflect the general notion that a taxpayer must have a donative intent to transfer property to the charity.\n[30] In short, Mr. Osborne and Mrs. Osborne lacked any contemporaneous knowledge of a charitable destination for the money tendered, were unknowledgeable of the even theoretical beneficiaries and employed a tax preparer as the conduit, selector, receipt collector and courier for any moneys and receipts. The needed legal requirements for a charitable gift are absent; donative intent does not exist given the facts. Lastly, in submissions, Mr. Osborne concurred with the analysis that the charitable receipts were fraudulent, albeit discovered by him after the fact.\nb) 163(2) Penalties [31] As noted, while the Minister pleaded both knowledge and gross negligence in the reply, counsel conceded during argument that only gross negligence would be pursued as a basis for imposing the penalties.\n[32] Gross negligence need not include an executed or effective action. Instead, it may arise from omission or inaction borne of wilful blindness[9]. In other words, in a marked departure from usual practice, did the taxpayer choose to ignore certain steps?\n[33] Relevant to appeals such as Mr. Osborne\u2019s, are certain factors to be analyzed to determine if a taxpayer has been wilfully blind when meandering the factual landscape before him. These summarized factors, arising in the case of Torres v The Queen[10] and applied and refined in other cases, are as follows:\n(a) knowledge of a false statement can be imputed by willful blindness;\n(b) the concept of willful blindness can be applied to gross negligence penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act;\n(c) in determining willful blindness, consideration must be given to the education and experience of the taxpayer;\n(d) to find willful blindness there must be a need or a suspicion for an inquiry;\n(e) circumstances that would indicate a need for an inquiry prior to filing, or flashing red lights\u2026, include the following:\n(i) the magnitude of the advantage or omission;\n(ii) the blatantness of the false statement and how really detectable it is;\n(iii) the lack of acknowledgement by the tax preparer who prepared the return in the return itself;\n(iv) unusual requests made by the tax preparer;\n(v) the tax preparer being previously unknown to the taxpayer;\n(vi) incomprehensible explanation by the tax preparer;\n(vii) whether others engaged the tax preparer or warned against doing so, or the taxpayer himself or herself expresses concern about telling others;\n(f) the final requirement for willful blindness is that the taxpayer makes no inquiry of the tax preparer to understand the return, nor makes any inquiry of a third party, nor the CRA itself.\nEducation and background of taxpayer\n[34] Mr. Osborne is a reasonably articulate and experienced businessman. He worked as a Vice-President in the financial services industry for various companies during 2006: Wells Fargo Canada, HSBC Canada and Manulife Bank of Canada. He testified that he could determine a person\u2019s character by the tenor of one\u2019s handshake and presence. To that end, he indicated he did not trust Khan from his first and only meeting. He found his handshake clammy, akin to a \u201cdead fish\u201d and his presence unengaging. From that point, he did not trust him, but had little choice to not use him as a tax preparer since the \u201cdie had been cast\u201d and it was too late to switch, so he stuck with Khan.\n[35] The following outlines, referable to the enumerated factors in Torres, why Mr. Osborne should have deployed his possessed skills of detection and discernment:\n(i) The extraordinary amounts of the claimed donations ($60,003), federal donation tax credits ($17,373) and received tax refund ($12,572) relative to the amounts given were completely irreconcilable per se, and also against any past charitable donations;\n(ii) Mr. Osborne simply had not given the amount of money he claimed he did at the time he said he did as recorded in his tax return;\n(iii) Mr. Khan did not indicate he prepared the tax return within the return, even though that was the job for which he was ostensibly retained;\n(iv) No donation was given directly to any charity: Khan continually attended the Osborne residence, requested that large sums of cash (and later cheques) be paid directly to him on the spur of the moment and in return hand delivered the charitable receipts to the Osbornes;\n(v) Khan was not known to Mr. Osborne (or Mrs. for that matter) prior to the late 2006 referral by Mrs. Osborne\u2019s co-worker who was also Mr. Osborne\u2019s supervised subordinate employee;\n(vi) The tax returns were prepared in handwritten format in pencil at the Osbornes\u2019 house; and,\n(vii) While the lure of \u201ca tax refund for the first time in years\u201d was a motivating factor, it is clear Mr. Osborne\u2019s own \u201clife learned\u201d better instincts raised a hesitation to proceed.\n[36] Lastly, the critical and final step to detection is a review of the tax return, particularly where Mr. Osborne\u2019s own instincts rang alarm bells. That last chance for detection was abandoned. Mr. Osborne stated in testimony that to this day he does not review his tax returns beyond the signing page. As such, in 2007 for his 2006 tax return, he did not engage in a review of his tax return reflective of his respective and distinct experience and knowledge. Taxpayers who choose not to review their tax returns, and who should know better than omit that required task, are grossly negligent.[11] For future, Mr. Osborne should take note of this and correct his intransigent omission.\n[37] In summary, all factors in Torres which ought to have raised suspicion were present to some degree or other at the time Mr. Osborne failed to read, and then filed his tax return. Choosing to be oblivious, despite such warnings, plays directly into the hands of gross negligence. The penalties shall remain.\n[38] For these reasons, the appeals are dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Winnipeg, Manitoba, this 13th day of July 2023.\n\u201cR.S.

KEEHN,\nappelant,\net\nSA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI,\nintim\u00e9.\n[TRADUCTION FRAN\u00c7AISE OFFICIELLE]\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT\nLe juge Russell\n[1] L\u2019appelant, M. Lin L. Keehn, interjette appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2020 en application de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) concernant son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018. Cette cotisation tient compte du refus du ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) selon lequel les 853 $ que l\u2019\u00e9pouse de M. Keehn avait pay\u00e9s en 2018 pour le stationnement de l\u2019h\u00f4pital constituait des \u00ab frais m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb aux termes de l\u2019article 118.2 de la Loi. Le ministre a ainsi exclu cette somme du calcul du solde du cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour frais m\u00e9dicaux (CIFM) auquel le ministre estimait que M. Keehn avait droit pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018.\n[2] Dans son avis d\u2019appel, M. Keehn invoque ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nMon \u00e9pouse doit se stationner pour obtenir ses traitements de dialyse, ce qui occasionne des frais de stationnement. Le paragraphe 118.2(2) sp\u00e9cifie les d\u00e9placements d\u2019au moins 80 km et n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le stationnement. Il n\u2019inclut ni n\u2019exclut express\u00e9ment le stationnement. Le stationnement n\u2019est pas l\u2019action de conduire un v\u00e9hicule. Il s\u2019agit en fait de ne pas conduire. Le paragraphe est discriminatoire envers les gens qui doivent effectuer un trajet de moins de 80 km pour recevoir des traitements m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires.\n[3] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, M. Keehn a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile de l\u2019entendre, m\u00eame si, fondamentalement, les faits n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contest\u00e9s. Le fait essentiel est qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de M. Keehn recevait, trois fois par semaine, des traitements de dialyse \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Alexandra \u00e0 Edmonton. Habituellement, Mme Keehn conduisait de la maison pour aller \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital o\u00f9 elle stationnait sa voiture. Puis, une fois sa s\u00e9ance de traitement termin\u00e9e, elle conduisait pour revenir \u00e0 la maison. Sa maison \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ 22 kilom\u00e8tres de l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\n[4] M. Keehn a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces traitements de dialyse \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la survie de son \u00e9pouse et que sans eux, elle serait morte. Il a assimil\u00e9 les frais de stationnement \u00e0 des frais pour traitements m\u00e9dicaux. Elle devait pouvoir stationner sa voiture pour recevoir les traitements. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les frais de stationnement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018 \u00e9tait de 853 $. Le ministre a accept\u00e9 d\u2019autres frais \u00e0 titre de frais m\u00e9dicaux totalisant 6 342 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018 de M. Keehn.\n[5] M. Keehn a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait infirmi\u00e8re \u00e0 la retraite et qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 ce m\u00eame h\u00f4pital pour une grande partie de sa carri\u00e8re d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re.\n[6] Le refus du ministre concernant les frais de stationnement \u00e0 titre de frais m\u00e9dicaux est fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 118.2(2) de la Loi, qui \u00e9nonce ce que sont des \u00ab frais m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb aux fins du calcul du montant du CIFM aux termes du paragraphe 118.2(1).\n[7] Comme je le mentionne plus t\u00f4t, M. Keehn a plaid\u00e9 dans son avis d\u2019appel que la Loi \u00e9tait discriminatoire en ce qui concerne les \u00ab frais raisonnables de d\u00e9placement \u00bb, incluant ainsi les frais de stationnement, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle permet d\u2019inclure de tels frais seulement pour les personnes qui doivent parcourir au moins 80 kilom\u00e8tres (aller simple) pour obtenir des traitements m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires.\n[8] Les alin\u00e9as 118.2(2)g) et h) de la Loi prescrivent ce qui suit :\n(2) [Frais m\u00e9dicaux] Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1), les frais m\u00e9dicaux d\u2019un particulier sont les frais pay\u00e9s :\ng) \u00e0 une personne dont l\u2019activit\u00e9 est une entreprise de transport, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce paiement se rapporte au transport, entre la localit\u00e9 o\u00f9 habitent le particulier, son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou une personne \u00e0 charge vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) et le lieu \u2013 situ\u00e9 \u00e0 40 kilom\u00e8tres au moins de cette localit\u00e9 \u2013 o\u00f9 des services m\u00e9dicaux sont habituellement dispens\u00e9s, ou vice-versa, des personnes suivantes :\n(i) le particulier, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou la personne \u00e0 charge,\n(ii) un seul particulier accompagnant le particulier, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou le conjoint de fait ou la personne \u00e0 charge, si ceux-ci sont d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019attestation \u00e9crite d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, incapables de voyager sans l\u2019aide d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs soins,\nsi les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\n(iii) il n\u2019est pas possible d\u2019obtenir dans cette localit\u00e9 des services m\u00e9dicaux sensiblement \u00e9quivalents,\n(iv) l\u2019itin\u00e9raire emprunt\u00e9 par le particulier, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou la personne \u00e0 charge est, compte tenu des circonstances, un itin\u00e9raire raisonnablement direct,\n(v) le particulier, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou la personne \u00e0 charge se rendent en ce lieu afin d\u2019obtenir des services m\u00e9dicaux pour eux-m\u00eames et il est raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances, qu\u2019ils s\u2019y rendent \u00e0 cette fin;\nh) pour les frais raisonnables de d\u00e9placement, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion des frais vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a g), engag\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du particulier, de l\u2019\u00e9poux ou du conjoint de fait ou d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) et, si ceux-ci sont, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019attestation \u00e9crite d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, incapables de voyager sans l\u2019aide d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs soins, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un seul particulier les accompagnant, afin d\u2019obtenir des services m\u00e9dicaux dans un lieu situ\u00e9 \u00e0 80 kilom\u00e8tres au moins de la localit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le particulier, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou le conjoint de fait ou la personne \u00e0 charge habitent, si les conditions vis\u00e9es aux sous-alin\u00e9as g)(iii) \u00e0 (v) sont r\u00e9unies;\n[9] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 118.2(2)h) de la Loi, qui distingue les distances aller simple de moins de 80 km, s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale \u00e0 toute personne pr\u00e9sentant une demande de CIFM.\n[10] La discrimination est trait\u00e9e au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, (Loi constitutionnelle de 1982). Cette disposition prescrit, sous l\u2019en-t\u00eate \u00ab Droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb :\n15 (1) [\u00c9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, \u00e9galit\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et protection \u00e9gale de la loi] La loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\n[11] Toutefois, ce n\u2019est pas le cas lorsque l\u2019expression ou l\u2019application d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif donn\u00e9, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118.2(2)h), \u00e9tablit des distinctions entre les personnes. Bien que cette disposition exprime une limite d\u2019au moins 80 km, cette limite n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur les diff\u00e9rences entre les personnes elles-m\u00eames, ou ne doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e en fonction de celles-ci. Elle est plut\u00f4t appliqu\u00e9e selon qu\u2019une personne doit parcourir une distance d\u2019au moins 80 km pour un voyage aller simple. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Keehn parcourait une distance de seulement 22 km pour un voyage aller simple.\n[12] Le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi de reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 titre de frais m\u00e9dicaux les co\u00fbts de stationnement hospitalier (faisant partie des \u00ab frais raisonnables de d\u00e9placement \u00bb) pour un voyage aller simple d\u2019au moins 80 km. Cela ne signifie toutefois pas que le l\u00e9gislateur fait preuve de discrimination lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019accorde pas la m\u00eame reconnaissance aux frais de stationnement pour un voyage aller simple d\u2019une distance moins longue. Le l\u00e9gislateur a le droit de faire de telles distinctions dans la Loi, comme la protection du fisc, sans que cela constitue de la discrimination telle qu\u2019elle est mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus.\n[13] S\u2019appuyant sur la jurisprudence, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ali c. Canada, 2008 CarswellNat 1629, 2008 CAF 190, au paragraphe 13, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a observ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du r\u00f4le du paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte dans le contexte des avantages du paragraphe 118.2(2) :\n13. Les appelantes veulent que le CIFM soit \u00e9tendu de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 couvrir les m\u00e9dicaments en vente libre, mais le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas choisi de le faire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les propos suivants tenus par la juge en chef McLachlin, au paragraphe 41 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Auton, [(Tutrice \u00e0 l\u2019instance de) c. Colombie-Britannique (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2004] 3 R.C.S. 657 (CSC)] sont pertinents :\n41. Il n\u2019est pas loisible au Parlement ou \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislature d\u2019adopter une loi dont les objectifs de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et les dispositions imposent \u00e0 un groupe d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 un traitement moins favorable : Corbiere c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 203. Par contre, la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur de ne pas accorder un avantage en particulier, lorsque l\u2019existence d\u2019un objectif, d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019un effet discriminatoire n\u2019est pas \u00e9tablie, ne contrevient pas \u00e0 ce principe ni ne justifie un examen fond\u00e9 sur le par. 15(1). Notre Cour a conclu \u00e0 maintes reprises que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de cr\u00e9er un avantage en particulier, qu\u2019il peut financer les programmes sociaux de son choix pour des raisons de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019avantage offert ne soit pas lui\u2011m\u00eame conf\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re discriminatoire : Granovsky c.

Cette cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la \u00ab p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation \u00bb et a \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur une analyse des comptes bancaires de l\u2019appelant.\n[4] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception d\u2019informations additionnelles, le ministre a \u00e9tabli le 16 octobre 2012, une nouvelle cotisation afin d\u2019ajouter aux revenus de l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008, un montant additionnel de 1 271 198 $ de revenus provenant du poker et a impos\u00e9 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi. Cette cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation.\n[5] Le 16 octobre 2012, le ministre a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli des nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011 par lesquelles le ministre a ajout\u00e9 les montants suivants aux revenus de l\u2019appelant :\n2009\n884 323 $\n2010\n454 867 $\n2011\n231 208 $\n[6] Le ministre a impos\u00e9 des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire r\u00e9sultant des ajouts aux revenus de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011.\n[7] Suite \u00e0 un consentement intervenu devant cette Cour sur la partie des appels de l\u2019appelant qui concerne l\u2019imposition de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi en vertu de nouvelles cotisations dat\u00e9es du 16 octobre 2012 concernant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008, 2009, 2010 et 2011, et la nouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la \u00ab p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation \u00bb, i.e., celle du 16 octobre 2012 concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008, la Cour a rendu le jugement suivant :\na) l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nouvelle cotisation dat\u00e9e du 16 octobre 2012 concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008 a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis sans frais et ladite cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e. Par contre, la nouvelle cotisation dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2012 concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008 demeure en litige;\nb) les appels \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations dat\u00e9es du 16 octobre 2012 concernant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis, sans frais, et les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es en annulant les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi.\n[8] Suite \u00e0 un consentement partiel intervenu entre les parties le 13 septembre 2021, les parties ont consenti, advenant que la Cour d\u00e9cide d\u2019imposer les gains de poker de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 titre de revenus d\u2019entreprise, que jugement soit rendu afin d\u2019accueillir partiellement les appels sans frais et de modifier les nouvelles cotisations dat\u00e9es du 16 octobre 2012 afin de diminuer le revenu imposable de l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2009 d\u2019un montant de 206 920 $, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2010 d\u2019un montant de 48 939 $, et pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011 d\u2019un montant de 3 367 $.\nII. La question en litige\n[9] La seule question en litige devant cette Cour consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les gains nets tir\u00e9s des activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker d\u2019Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul de son revenu d\u2019une source qui est une entreprise en vertu des articles 3 et 9 de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008, 2009, 2010 et 2011.\n[10] Le calcul des montants des gains nets tir\u00e9s des activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker d\u2019Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en litige devant cette Cour.\nIII. Th\u00e8ses des parties\nA. Position de l\u2019appelant\n[11] Selon l\u2019appelant, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si le poker est un jeu de hasard et de chance (pari) ou s\u2019il constitue un jeu d\u2019habilet\u00e9.\n[12] Si la Cour en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que le poker est un jeu de chance et de hasard, alors elle doit accueillir les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations sur la base de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f ) de la Loi.\n[13] Selon l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019identifier la source de revenu d\u2019un contribuable afin de d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on dont ce revenu sera trait\u00e9 pour fins fiscales.\n[14] Les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au jeu d\u2019un contribuable peuvent constituer un revenu imposable si elles constituent une source de revenus. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les gains provenant d\u2019un jeu de hasard ne sont pas imposables puisqu\u2019ils ne proviennent pas d\u2019une source de revenus.\n[15] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un contribuable constituent une source de revenus tir\u00e9s d\u2019une entreprise ou non, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart c. Canada, 2002 CSC 46 (\u00ab Stewart \u00bb) une approche \u00e0 deux volets.\n[16] Le premier consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019activit\u00e9 de poker est faite en vue de r\u00e9aliser un profit ou s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9marche personnelle. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 comporte un aspect personnel que cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est pertinente car lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable n\u2019est aucunement personnelle, il y aura n\u00e9cessairement existence d\u2019une source de revenus au sens de la Loi.\n[17] Si l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable peut \u00e0 la fois \u00eatre un passe-temps et une entreprise, il faut alors se demander si cette activit\u00e9 est exploit\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re suffisamment commerciale, soit avec l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit \u00e9tay\u00e9 par une preuve objective d\u2019un comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux (par. 54 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart).\n[18] Lors de l\u2019analyse de cette intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit, il est important de prendre en consid\u00e9ration tous les faits entourant l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019un ensemble de facteurs. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldowan c. La Reine, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 480 (\u00ab Moldowan \u00bb), la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 les quatre crit\u00e8res suivants afin de d\u00e9terminer objectivement si un contribuable a une expectative raisonnable de profit :\na) l\u2019\u00e9tat des profits et des pertes pour les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures;\nb) la formation du contribuable;\nc) la voie sur laquelle le contribuable entend s\u2019engager; et\nd) la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit.\n[19] Ces crit\u00e8res ne constituent cependant pas une liste exhaustive des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer. Il faut d\u00e9terminer globalement si le contribuable exerce l\u2019activit\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re commerciale. La jurisprudence a notamment mis de l\u2019avant le crit\u00e8re de la minimisation du risque dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise par le contribuable. En effet, les tribunaux consid\u00e8rent que la prise de risque est une caract\u00e9ristique inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice des revenus et que c\u2019est plut\u00f4t la minimisation du risque ou la gestion du risque qui est susceptible de faire de cette activit\u00e9 une source de revenus.\n[20] La simple recherche du profit ne suffit pas \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019un contribuable exploite une entreprise. L\u2019analyse de l\u2019ensemble des crit\u00e8res doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique du jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce car il est \u00e9vident que la totalit\u00e9 des joueurs ont l\u2019intention de faire un profit lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019adonnent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s ou jeux.\n[21] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Cohen c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 262 (\u00ab Cohen \u00bb), il doit y avoir plus que le simple espoir ou d\u00e9sir de gagner. Une expectative planifi\u00e9e et raisonnable de r\u00e9aliser un profit doit exister. Les gains de jeu d\u2019un contribuable qui a l\u2019intention de gagner mais qui ne m\u00e8ne pas ses activit\u00e9s comme le ferait un homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux, ne seront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas imposables.\n[22] Le second volet de l\u2019approche d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart, \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si la source du revenu est celle d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien n\u2019a pas d\u2019application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce si l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable ne repr\u00e9sente pas une d\u00e9marche personnelle et qu\u2019il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le contribuable avait l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit. L\u2019appelant admet qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait alors d\u2019un revenu d\u2019entreprise.\n[23] Selon les procureurs de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019application des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence aux faits particuliers de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9montre que :\na) le poker est une activit\u00e9 \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel;\nb) les activit\u00e9s de poker de l\u2019appelant servaient uniquement \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des fonds pour des activit\u00e9s de loisirs et n\u2019avaient pas pour but de maximiser ses revenus;\nc) avant 2008, l\u2019appelant s\u2019adonnait au poker de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9cr\u00e9ative et amicale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fait la preuve des revenus ant\u00e9rieurs de l\u2019appelant. La v\u00e9rification des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 compte du 1er janvier 2008 sans \u00e9gard aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelant. Cela d\u00e9montre le peu de s\u00e9rieux du travail effectu\u00e9 par le v\u00e9rificateur qui a simplement pris pour acquis que l\u2019appelant exploitait une entreprise \u00e0 compte du 1er janvier 2008;\nd) l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il a appris \u00e0 jouer au poker par le biais d\u2019un de ses amis. A ses d\u00e9buts, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un ma\u00eetre des \u00e9checs qui avait peu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les jeux de cartes. Il a appris les r\u00e8gles du jeu de poker et il a lu un livre \u00e0 ce sujet. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais suivi ou eu une formation particuli\u00e8re, pertinente et significative sur le jeu de poker;\ne) l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019intention \u00e0 long terme de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait d\u2019exploiter une entreprise. L\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet, qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite d\u2019un \u00e9pisode d\u00e9pressif ayant d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un diagnostic de diab\u00e8te de Type 1, il a d\u00e9couvert le jeu de poker par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un ami. Il a consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps au jeu de poker suivant un horaire tr\u00e8s variable. Il a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 des sommes importantes dans des f\u00eates et dans l\u2019alcool et les drogues. L\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tant de plus en plus pr\u00e9sente, il s\u2019est lass\u00e9 de sa passion du jeu de poker et s\u2019est inscrit \u00e0 un baccalaur\u00e9at en math\u00e9matiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval qui \u00e9tait toujours en cours lors de l\u2019audition de la cause.\nf) le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il cherchait avant tout la comp\u00e9tition, l\u2019adr\u00e9naline, le \u00ab thrill \u00bb. L\u2019appelant mettait au d\u00e9fi des joueurs consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme tr\u00e8s bons \u00e0 jouer t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate (heads-up en anglais) un jeu hautement risqu\u00e9 et o\u00f9 les mises de plusieurs milliers de dollars peuvent \u00eatre perdues tr\u00e8s rapidement. Selon l\u2019appelant, ce comportement est risqu\u00e9, t\u00e9m\u00e9raire et irrationnel. Lorsqu\u2019il perd des sommes importantes, l\u2019appelant tente de se refaire en jouant au poker de tr\u00e8s longues p\u00e9riodes de temps ou en se tournant vers les tables de \u00ab blackjack \u00bb, un jeu de chance o\u00f9 la maison gagne toujours \u00e0 long terme;\ng) l\u2019appelant n\u2019a aucune tenue de livre ou de comptabilit\u00e9 et il n\u2019a \u00e9labor\u00e9 aucune strat\u00e9gie pour d\u00e9velopper une entreprise viable. L\u2019appelant est jeune et na\u00eff et il n\u2019a aucune vision \u00e0 long terme pour son futur. Il n\u2019a aucun plan d\u2019affaires;\nh) la situation de l\u2019appelant ressemble davantage \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de jeu pathologique qu\u2019\u00e0 un plan d\u2019affaires. L\u2019appelant est du type anxieux et il joue au poker pour, entre autre choses, calmer son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a clairement une d\u00e9pendance au jeu;\ni) la preuve administr\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audition ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tayer que l\u2019appelant poss\u00e8de la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un profit. Le fait que l\u2019appelant ait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 plus de gains que de pertes durant les ann\u00e9es en litige ne permet pas de conclure que des activit\u00e9s de poker constituent n\u00e9cessairement une activit\u00e9 commerciale. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit est impr\u00e9visible et instable;\nj) selon la preuve au dossier et le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut validement soutenir que l\u2019appelant a adopt\u00e9 un comportement permettant la minimisation du risque. Il joue souvent sous l\u2019influence de l\u2019alcool et il met souvent d\u2019autres joueurs au d\u00e9fi. Lors de l\u2019audition, l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9fi\u00e9 un joueur pour une mise suppl\u00e9mentaire de 10 contre 1 (50 000 $\/ 5 000 $) simplement dans le but de ridiculiser cet opposant. La soif de l\u2019appelant pour le \u00ab gambling \u00bb anille toute pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 minimiser son risque et confirme ses d\u00e9cisions irrationnelles;\nk) l\u2019appelant ne choisit pas ses opposants et il se limite \u00e0 acc\u00e9der aux tables disponibles. Il joue \u00e0 de multiples tables simultan\u00e9ment (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 tables en m\u00eame temps) \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 il en perdait le contr\u00f4le;\nl) le fait que l\u2019appelant jouait en ligne de mani\u00e8re fr\u00e9quente et pendant une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e ne fait preuve de rien. Le nombre et la fr\u00e9quence des paris sont davantage r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs d\u2019un comportement compulsif et d\u2019un trouble de d\u00e9pendance que de commercialit\u00e9 d\u2019une activit\u00e9.\n[24] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont soutenu que les jeux de hasard n\u2019ont pas les caract\u00e9ristiques inh\u00e9rentes essentielles \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination que l\u2019appelant exploitait une activit\u00e9 commerciale pouvant g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un revenu imposable.\n[25] Lors de l\u2019audience, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que peu de fiabilit\u00e9 et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es aux extraits que l\u2019on retrouve dans les divers forums et blogues disponibles en ligne sur internet. C\u2019est pour cette raison que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a retir\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de trois quarts des pi\u00e8ces au dossier de l\u2019appelant, lesquelles pi\u00e8ces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es aux fins de la r\u00e9daction du rapport de v\u00e9rification de l\u2019appelant et du rapport d\u2019expertise de monsieur Randal D. Heeb, docteur en \u00e9conomie, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au dossier de l\u2019appelant. Il est soumis que si les passages du rapport de v\u00e9rification et du rapport d\u2019expertise de monsieur Heeb qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux pi\u00e8ces retir\u00e9es et dont la preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite lors de l\u2019audition, le rapport de v\u00e9rification et le rapport d\u2019expertise seraient t\u00e9nus, voire factuellement infond\u00e9s.\n[26] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont attaqu\u00e9 le rapport de l\u2019expert Heeb retenu par l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur plusieurs fronts :\na) \u00e9tant docteur en \u00e9conomie, ce dernier ne poss\u00e8de pas les connaissances approfondies et la compr\u00e9hension pouss\u00e9e et tr\u00e8s technique que requiert une expertise math\u00e9matique et statistique afin de d\u00e9terminer avec un degr\u00e9 de certitude scientifique si le jeu de poker est un jeu de chance ou d\u2019habilet\u00e9;\nb) l\u2019expert Heeb mentionne avoir t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme expert dans le cadre de cinq proc\u00e8s aux \u00c9tats-Unis et un proc\u00e8s au Canada (Cohen c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) 2015 CF 1192). Contrairement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019expert souhaite laisser croire, ses conclusions sur le jeu de poker n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es et encore moins avalis\u00e9es ou confirm\u00e9es par un tribunal au Canada. Par contre, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, un juge de premi\u00e8re instance a effectivement conclu que le poker est un jeu o\u00f9 les habilet\u00e9s pr\u00e9dominent sur la chance mais la Cour d\u2019appel dans la m\u00eame affaire a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance (voir United States v. Di Cristina, 12-3720 (726 F.3d 3292) et la Cour supr\u00eame des \u00c9tats-Unis a refus\u00e9 de se saisir de l\u2019appel formul\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur Di Cristina, mettant ainsi fin au d\u00e9bat;\nc) le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 celui d\u2019un t\u00e9moin de fait s\u2019auto qualifiant de joueur de poker professionnel plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 celui d\u2019un expert en \u00e9conomie impartial et ind\u00e9pendant. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019expert a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses propres habitudes de jeu, a inf\u00e9r\u00e9 des conclusions sur les comportements des joueurs alors qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas les qualifications requises pour ce faire et a formul\u00e9 des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sans aucune source \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Selon le t\u00e9moignage global de l\u2019expert, ce dernier ne pr\u00e9sente pas une opinion objective \u00e0 la Cour et il n\u2019a pas le degr\u00e9 requis d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 pour que son opinion et son expertise soient retenues.\n[27] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux rapports de contre-expertise. Un premier rapport de monsieur Mathieu Dufour, docteur en math\u00e9matiques ayant r\u00e9dig\u00e9 son th\u00e8se de doctorat sur la th\u00e9orie des jeux, visait \u00e0 analyser et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la part de hasard dans le r\u00e9sultat du jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em. Selon cet expert, deux conclusions s\u2019imposent :\na) l\u2019issue d\u2019une partie de poker d\u00e9pend manifestement \u00e0 la fois du hasard par la distribution des cartes et de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des joueurs;\nb) d\u00e9crivant la th\u00e9orie des jeux, la part du hasard et de chance pr\u00e9domine toujours sur la part d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Selon son analyse statistique des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019appelant, les r\u00e9sultats de ce dernier ne sont pas sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la moyenne.\n[28] L\u2019expert Dufour a \u00e9mis plusieurs critiques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des rapports de l\u2019expert Heeb, dont les suivants :\na) les tests effectu\u00e9s ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants;\nb) une erreur scientifique et logique est commise en ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il y a une partie d\u2019habilet\u00e9 dans le jeu de poker mais qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9montre pas que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 est pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante; et\nc) la \u00ab mesure de contribution d\u2019habilet\u00e9 \u00bb d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 aucun des crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une mesure statistique robuste et fiable.\n[29] Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport de contre-expertise est celui de monsieur Jeffrey Rosenthal, docteur en statistiques, lequel visait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la part de contribution de la chance et de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 dans le jeu de poker en ligne et de d\u00e9terminer si les tests statistiques effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019expert Heeb respectent les enseignements statistiques requis.\n[30] Cet expert a conclu avec certitude que les tests et analyses effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019expert Heeb ne permettent pas de d\u00e9terminer que les habilet\u00e9s pr\u00e9dominent sur la chance au poker. Selon lui, il est impossible de d\u00e9terminer le degr\u00e9 r\u00e9el que jouent la chance et l\u2019habilet\u00e9 au poker et qu\u2019il est ind\u00e9niable que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9domine pas sur la chance et ce, malgr\u00e9 des centaines de mains jou\u00e9es. Il r\u00e9fute d\u2019embl\u00e9e la conclusion tir\u00e9e par l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019apr\u00e8s seulement 3 000 mains, la chance est occult\u00e9e par les habilet\u00e9s.\nB. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[31] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne le sens tr\u00e8s large donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab entreprise \u00bb au paragraphe 248(1) de la Loi : sont compris parmi les entreprises, les professions, m\u00e9tiers, commerces, industries ou activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et [\u2026] les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial.\n[32] Selon l\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cohen, lorsque les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un contribuable comportent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment personnel (comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent) la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si cette activit\u00e9 est exploit\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on suffisamment commerciale pour se qualifier d\u2019entreprise et \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une source de revenu aux fins de la Loi.\n[33] Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart, 2002 CSC 46, pour qu\u2019une activit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de commerciale par nature, le contribuable doit avoir l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit. Cette d\u00e9termination doit se faire en fonction de facteurs objectifs et cette activit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des normes objectives de comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux.\n[34] La nature commerciale d\u2019une activit\u00e9 se caract\u00e9rise par l\u2019existence d\u2019un syst\u00e8me organis\u00e9 dans le but de g\u00e9rer ou d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les risques. L\u2019absence d\u2019un tel syst\u00e8me distingue un joueur inv\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un joueur professionnel (voir Balanko c. MNR, 81 DTC 887).\n[35] L\u2019application du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit aux causes de gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par le jeu ou les paris \u00ab consiste \u00e0 essayer de voir quel est l\u2019objectif dominant de la personne en cause, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019exploiter une entreprise ou de simplement se divertir \u00bb (voir MNR c. Mordern, 61 DTC 126 \u00e0 la page 1267).\n[36] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldovan, les facteurs objectifs suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit :\na) l\u2019\u00e9tat des profits et pertes des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures;\nb) la formation du contribuable;\nc) la voie sur laquelle il entendait s\u2019engager; et\nd) la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un profit.\n[37] La liste de facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldovan n\u2019est pas exhaustive et d\u2019autres facteurs peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[38] L\u2019application de ces crit\u00e8res aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause d\u00e9montre que :\n\u00c9tats des profits et pertes des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures\nselon le registre de jeu de l\u2019appelant sur le site de PartyPoker, l\u2019appelant avait, au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2007, dans son compte (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb) la somme de 243 966 $.\napr\u00e8s avoir tout perdu au d\u00e9but, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tudier plus s\u00e9rieusement les rudiments du jeu de poker. Il a lu quelques livres et a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des forums de discussions en plus de visionner des parties \u00e0 hautes limites en temps r\u00e9el;\nde 2008 \u00e0 2010 inclusivement, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est abonn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs sites (5) d\u2019apprentissage du poker sur internet;\nil perfectionne son jeu en discutant de strat\u00e9gies avec d\u2019autres joueurs. Il publie et commente des mains de poker sur des forums de discussions. Il regarde des parties hautes limites jou\u00e9es en ligne et il analyse lui-m\u00eame les mains qu\u2019il joue.\nFormation\nVoie sur laquelle il \u00e9tend s\u2019engager\nl\u2019appelant \u00e0 abandonn\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes en actuariat pour se concentrer au jeu de poker;\nle poker est au centre de sa vie sociale et il poursuit ses activit\u00e9s de jeu en ligne m\u00eame en voyage qui inclue toujours une destination o\u00f9 se d\u00e9roule des tournois;\nl\u2019appelant consacrait une trentaine d\u2019heures par semaine au jeuen ligne sur plusieurs tables en m\u00eame temps : tables \u00e0 1 contre 1, 4 \u00e0 12 tables \u00e0 6 joueurs et occasionnellement \u00e0 des tables \u00e0 9 joueurs;\nentre 2008 et 2012, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a exerc\u00e9 aucun autre emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur.\nCapacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser des profits\nles gains que l\u2019appelant a tir\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s de poker sont de 1 648 676 $ en 2008, 884 323 $ en 2009, 454 867 $ en 2010 et 231 208 $ en 2011;\nselon l\u2019expert Heeb, ces gains d\u00e9montrent un tr\u00e8s haut niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9 et une expectative de profit de 0,13 (cent) par main;\nselon la contre-expertise du professeur Rosenthal, l\u2019appelant a une probabilit\u00e9 de gain de 58,4 % apr\u00e8s 104 185 mains.\nGestion ou minimisation du risque selon des normes objectives de comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux\nl\u2019appelant adapte son jeu en fonction de son exp\u00e9rience et des sommes disponibles dans ses comptes (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb). Il augmente graduellement son niveau de jeu aux tables (5 $\/10 $ et 20 $\/40 $);\nl\u2019appelant adopte un comportement s\u00e9rieux en retirant 30 000 $ de son compte (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb) afin de s\u00e9curiser cet argent et limiter \u00e0 12 000 $ son risque pour prendre de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience aux NL400;\nl\u2019appelant utilise pendant 2 ou 3 mois le logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager qui permet d\u2019identifier ses adversaires et d\u2019obtenir certaines statistiques sur leur fa\u00e7on de jouer. Il a dit qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait faire sa propre analyse de la force de ses adversaires et se renseigner sur ses adversaires sur des sites internet;\nl\u2019appelant joue surtout en ligne et sur plusieurs tables de jeu en m\u00eame temps (tables de 1 contre 1, tables \u00e0 6 joueurs et \u00e0 l\u2019occasion \u00e0 9 joueurs);\nl\u2019appelant effectue des \u00e9changes d\u2019argent du site PartyPoker avec d\u2019autres joueurs, dont M. Philippe D\u2019Auteuil, contre de l\u2019argent sur d\u2019autres sites pour des raisons d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de rapidit\u00e9 des transactions et pour \u00e9viter les d\u00e9lais de passage de l\u2019argent par son compte de banque.\nIV. T\u00e9moignage de monsieur Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9\n[39] Monsieur Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour expliquer son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le poker et pour relater ses activit\u00e9s au cours des ann\u00e9es en litige, soit les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2011.\n[40] L\u2019appelant est maintenant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 34 ans et il r\u00e9side \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Il est le p\u00e8re d\u2019une petite fille alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de trois mois. Il \u00e9tudie en \u00e9conomie \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval depuis 2016.\n[41] L\u2019appelant a entrepris ses \u00e9tudes au niveau du secondaire avec de bonnes notes et il voulait \u00eatre math\u00e9maticien. Il est du type sportif (badminton, soccer) et il affectionne jouer aux \u00e9checs.\n[42] \u00c0 la fin de son secondaire IV, il a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de diab\u00e8te de type 1 qui l\u2019a beaucoup affect\u00e9 (perte de motivation et il se renferme sur lui-m\u00eame). Apr\u00e8s avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 son secondaire V de justesse, il s\u2019est inscrit au CEGEP de Rimouski en sciences de la nature. Il n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s motiv\u00e9 et il n\u2019assiste pas \u00e0 tous ses cours. Il s\u2019inscrit \u00e0 des cours qu\u2019il doit reprendre durant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[43] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2005, alors qu\u2019il avait 18 ans, il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un tournoi d\u2019\u00e9chec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9. En septembre 2005, il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre tournoi d\u2019\u00e9chec \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2005, il a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps aux jeux vid\u00e9o et au jeu d\u2019\u00e9chec. Il a arr\u00eat\u00e9 alors les sports et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre de l\u2019alcool. Il s\u2019est initi\u00e9 au poker en jouant avec un ami qui avait une valise de jetons.\n[44] \u00c0 l\u2019hiver 2006, il s\u2019est familiaris\u00e9 avec les r\u00e8gles du poker et il a effectu\u00e9 un premier d\u00e9p\u00f4t sur un site de jeux. Il a lu un livre sur les rudiments du poker.\n[45] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2006, il a jou\u00e9 avec de petites mises car il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019argent pour jouer. Il a essay\u00e9 de voler de l\u2019argent dans des automobiles et des mots de passe de courriels de ses amis. Il a tout perdu et ses parents chez qui il demeurait, ont refus\u00e9 de lui pr\u00eater de l\u2019argent. Il a cess\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes et a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un tournoi de poker \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qu\u2019il a perdu.\n[46] En 2007, l\u2019appelant a retir\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 de son \u00e9pargne, soit 1 000 $ et il l\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sur le site PartyPoker. Il jouait alors beaucoup au poker et un peu aux \u00e9checs. Il s\u2019est inscrit sur des forums de discussions et il regardait les joueurs jouer. Il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un tournoi de poker \u00e0 Cap Rouge et il y a rencontr\u00e9 d\u2019autres joueurs. L\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il jouait alors environ 35 heures par semaine et que 95 % de son temps de jeu \u00e9tait sur internet au site de PartyPoker. \u00c0 la fin de 2007, il avait un \u00ab bankroll \u00bb de 150 000 $.\n[47] L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9, qu\u2019en 2008, il avait un mode de vie d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9 et de d\u00e9bauche. Il a arr\u00eat\u00e9 toutes ses activit\u00e9s physiques et sportives sauf les \u00e9checs. Pendant la semaine, il jouait au poker la nuit et se couchait tr\u00e8s tard. Lorsqu\u2019il jouait, il buvait de la boisson et fumait de la marijuana. Les fins de semaine, il fr\u00e9quentait les bars avec ses amis et il se couchait tr\u00e8s tard. Le \u00ab gambling \u00bb est omnipr\u00e9sent dans sa vie. Il gageait sur tout comme les factures de restaurants. Lorsqu\u2019il perdait, il devenait bouillant et il lui arrivait de perdre la carte. Il \u00e9tait un mauvais perdant et il cherchait toujours \u00e0 se venger. Pour se refaire, il jouait au Black Jack. C\u2019est en 2008, que l\u2019appelant a rencontr\u00e9 messieurs Philippe D\u2019Auteuil et Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re via les forums de discussions et les parties entre amis.\n[48] L\u2019appelant a fourni des explications concernant les tournois en personne auxquels il a particip\u00e9 de 2008 \u00e0 2010. Il a dit avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une vingtaine de tournois dont il se serait sorti comme l\u00e9g\u00e8rement perdant. En plus des tournois annuels \u00e0 Las Vegas et aux Bahamas, il a notamment particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des tournois \u00e0 Londres, \u00e0 Prague avec monsieur Jonathan Duhamel et \u00e0 Amsterdam. Lors des tournois \u00e0 Las Vegas en 2009 et 2010, il a lou\u00e9 une r\u00e9sidence avec des amis dont les portes \u00e9taient ouvertes pour accueillir les joueurs de poker qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et les f\u00eatards.\n[49] Le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2010, l\u2019appelant a sign\u00e9 un contrat d\u2019achat d\u2019un condominium \u00e0 Sainte-Foy au prix de 530 000 $. L\u2019appelant est d\u00e9crit dans ce contrat comme \u00e9tant un professionnel de poker.\n[50] Concernant ses heures de jeu, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9, qu\u2019en 2012, il ne jouait qu\u2019entre 15 \u00e0 20 heures par semaine, alors qu\u2019en 2007 et 2008, il pouvait jouer 30 heures par semaine. Sa passion du jeu s\u2019estompait en 2010. C\u2019est en 2010 qu\u2019il dit avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consommer de la coca\u00efne lors des f\u00eates, laquelle consommation a fortement augment\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es suivantes.\n[51] En 2015, il a fait une crise de panique caus\u00e9e par le stress, l\u2019alcool et les drogues. Il a pris des m\u00e9dicaments pendant une ann\u00e9e.\n[52] En 2016, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est inscrit au baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9conomie et en math\u00e9matiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[53] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage et de son contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement fourni des informations concernant ses habitudes de jeu.\n[54] Il jouait au poker en ligne 95% de son temps de jeu et seulement 5% du temps \u00e0 des tournois en pr\u00e9sentiel. Lorsqu\u2019il jouait en ligne, il jouait des \u00ab cash game \u00bb sans limite. Dans un tiers des cas, il jouait \u00e0 un contre un jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quatre tables \u00e0 la fois. Dans les 2\/3 des cas, il jouait avec plusieurs joueurs dont le nombre pouvait varier de 4 \u00e0 12 joueurs. En moyenne, il jouait \u00e0 des tables de six joueurs \u00e0 six tables \u00e0 la fois.\n[55] Les limites de jeu auxquelles il jouait d\u00e9pendaient des disponibilit\u00e9s. Ses limites de jeu \u00e9taient surtout des 5 $\/10 $, 10 $\/20 $ et 25 $\/50 $. L\u2019appelant a relat\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019une fois, il a jou\u00e9 \u00e0 une limite de 100 $\/200 $ et qu\u2019il a perdu 100 000 $ en une seule soir\u00e9e.\n[56] L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts, il jouait exclusivement sur le site de Party Poker. Par la suite, il a \u00e9galement jou\u00e9 sur le site de FullTiltPoker \u00e0 60% de son temps de jeu et sur le site de PokerStars dans environ 20% de son temps de jeu.\n[57] L\u2019appelant a de plus reconnu avoir acquis en 2008 ou 2009, les logiciels Hold\u2019em Manager et Poker Tracker qui compilent des statistiques dont ses gains et avoir fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 des sites comme Pokertableratings.com qui compilent les statistiques des parties jou\u00e9es par les joueurs et qui affichaient notamment les gains de chacun. L\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il utilisait peu ces donn\u00e9es statistiques pendant qu\u2019il jouait parce que \u00e7a lui faisait perdre sa concentration.\n[58] L\u2019appelant a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des forums de discussions sur le site Pokercollectif pour se valoriser et rabaisser les autres joueurs. Il a \u00ab post\u00e9 \u00bb des mains de gros pots. Selon lui, environ 80% de ses publications sont non reli\u00e9es au poker. Il a aussi reconnu avoir accord\u00e9 des entrevues dont une \u00e0 Simon Gravel, auteur du livre \u00ab Les ma\u00eetres du Poker \u00bb.\n[59] De 2008 \u00e0 2012, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie de jeu en \u00e9tudiant les rudiments du poker, en regardant des parties de hautes limites et en discutant de mains avec d\u2019autres joueurs.\n[60] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019appelant a reconnu avoir utilis\u00e9 plusieurs pseudonymes sur les sites de poker sur lesquels il jouait dont les suivants :\nRoland Thetrault (FullTiltPoker);\nTiltman et Tabarnaaaaak (PartyPoker);\nNegro Vente 1 (PokerStars).\n[61] Pendant la p\u00e9riode en litige, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est notamment abonn\u00e9 au site de Card Runners qui montre des vid\u00e9os de joueurs en action et qui expliquent les raisons des gestes qu\u2019ils posent.

D\u2019apr\u00e8s un \u00e9chantillonnage effectu\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9 environ 130 heures en avril (soit 28 jours sur 30) et 237 heures en novembre (soit 30 jours sur 30). Cette derni\u00e8re statistique repr\u00e9sente un temps de jeu moyen de 4h20 par jour en avril et 7h54 en novembre (pour une moyenne variant entre 30 et 56 heures par semaine).\n[69] Le v\u00e9rificateur a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a choisi d\u2019effectuer un \u00e9chantillonnage uniquement pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008 puisque l\u2019appelant a, \u00e0 partir de 2009, commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9placer ses activit\u00e9s de poker sur les sites FullTiltPoker et PokerStars.\n[70] L\u2019analyse de la carte de cr\u00e9dit Visa de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que celui-ci se trouvait en Australie au cours des mois de f\u00e9vrier et mars 2008, ce qui ne l\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de jouer au poker en ligne pratiquement tous les jours lors de son voyage.\n[71] L\u2019analyse des gains totaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s uniquement sur le site PartyPoker d\u00e9montre que ses gains sont \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de 2 949 171 $ pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2011, soit en moyenne de 750 000 $ annuellement. Les gains r\u00e9els r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant sont probablement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s puisque l\u2019appelant jouait au poker sur d\u2019autres sites de poker.\n[72] L\u2019analyse des relev\u00e9s bancaires de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9poser des dizaines de milliers de dollars mensuellement dans ses comptes bancaires provenant de ses activit\u00e9s de poker.

L\u2019\u00e9tude la plus int\u00e9ressante est celle men\u00e9e en 2019 par des experts en informatique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Carnegie Mellon qui a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Pluribus, une cr\u00e9ature d\u2019intelligence artificielle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de battre un groupe d\u2019\u00e9lite de cinq joueurs professionnels \u00e0 une table de six joueurs jouant au Texas Hold\u2019em sans limite via internet. L\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019une s\u00e9quence de 10 000 mains a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Pluribus a nettement domin\u00e9 les joueurs professionnels.\n[79] L\u2019expert Heeb a produit un second rapport dat\u00e9 du 8 septembre 2020 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un mandat de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer si l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une grande habilet\u00e9 au poker (si possible, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel degr\u00e9) et si les gains de poker obtenus par l\u2019appelant au cours des ann\u00e9es 2009, 2010 et 2011 correspondaient \u00e0 son niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Pour r\u00e9aliser son mandat, l\u2019expert a consult\u00e9 ses rapports en relation avec l\u2019affaire Di Cristina et des documents publics dont le livre de Simon Gravel intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Les Ma\u00eetres du poker \u00bb, des entrevues, des extraits de forums de discussions et plusieurs autres documents et vid\u00e9os sur internet et des donn\u00e9es de HandHQ concernant des mises de 0,50 \u00a2\/1 $ jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 $\/20 $.\n[80] Selon les donn\u00e9es de HandHQ, l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9 104,184 mains en ne tenant compte que de son jeu aux mises 10 $\/ 20 $ et a gagn\u00e9 13 451 $ pour une moyenne de 0,13 \u00a2 par main au cours de la p\u00e9riode du mois d\u2019avril 2010 au mois de mars 2011. L\u2019expert Heeb a compar\u00e9 ces r\u00e9sultats avec ceux de trois groupes de comparaison, soit la \u00ab population totale \u00bb qui comprend l\u2019ensemble des joueurs, les \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb qui comprend tous les joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 moins de 1 000 mains et la moiti\u00e9 des joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 plus de 1 000 mains, et les \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb qui comprend la moiti\u00e9 des joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 plus de 1 000 mains mais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb et qui ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un profit par main, sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moyenne dans leur premier deux-tiers de mains. La cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb repr\u00e9sentait 90.8 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 10 $\/20 $ et 88.8 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 5 $\/10 $.

Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision du rapport du professeur Rosenthal, l\u2019expert Heeb a maintenu les opinons qu\u2019il a rendues dans ses deux rapports pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Selon lui, le poker est un jeu o\u00f9 la contribution de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des joueurs pr\u00e9domine sur la contribution du facteur chance dans la d\u00e9termination des r\u00e9sultats des parties. L\u2019expert a, de plus, r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un tr\u00e8s habile joueur de poker car il se situe dans le percentile 75.29 % des gains par main des joueurs faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie de la \u00ab population totale \u00bb et dans le percentile 99.10 % des joueurs faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb.\n[83] L\u2019expert Heeb a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait une probabilit\u00e9 de 58.4 % de gagner la moyenne le salaire annuel d\u2019un entrepreneur am\u00e9ricain de 50 000 $ am\u00e9ricains et qu\u2019il avait une probabilit\u00e9 de 66.2 % de gagner un profit net annuel en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il s\u2019adonne au poker \u00e0 plein temps.\n[84] Le 14 juillet 2021, l\u2019expert Heeb a produit un autre rapport de contre-expertise au rapport du Dr. Mathieu Dufour, un des deux experts retenus par l\u2019appelant. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait une r\u00e9vision exhaustive du rapport du Dr. Dufour, l\u2019expert Heeb a maintenu toujours que le poker est un jeu d\u2019habilet\u00e9 en ce sens que la contribution du facteur habilet\u00e9 est plus important que la contribution du facteur chance dans la d\u00e9termination des r\u00e9sultats au poker. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du Dr. Dufour, l\u2019expert Heeb est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant est un joueur tr\u00e8s habile et que le succ\u00e8s financier substantiel et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier en jouant du poker est compatible avec son haut niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9.\n[85] L\u2019expert Heeb a en premier lieu, abord\u00e9 et r\u00e9fut\u00e9 les trois principaux points de d\u00e9saccord soulev\u00e9s par le Dr. Dufour, \u00e0 savoir que :\nles diff\u00e9rents crit\u00e8res d\u2019habilet\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants;\nles crit\u00e8res et les analyses propos\u00e9s sont des crit\u00e8res pour d\u00e9terminer si le degr\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 au poker est plus grand que z\u00e9ro, et non pour d\u00e9terminer si la contribution de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 est plus grande que la contribution du facteur chance;\nla mesure du degr\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 manque d\u2019un indice de confiance (i.e. une marge d\u2019erreur), n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9finition non ambig\u00fce, ne mesure pas le concept d\u00e9sir\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 et ne g\u00e9n\u00e8re pas de r\u00e9sultat constant.\n[86] Par la suite, l\u2019expert a clarifi\u00e9 des points qui portaient \u00e0 confusion dont le crit\u00e8re d\u2019habilet\u00e9, le calcul du nombre de mains jou\u00e9es et le rythme de jeu d\u2019un joueur de poker professionnel qui joue en ligne. Concernant ce dernier point, l\u2019expert Heeb a discut\u00e9 de trois sources possibles de confusion.\n[87] La premi\u00e8re source de confusion concerne le nombre de parties jou\u00e9es en personne par des professionnels. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, le rythme de jeu en personne d\u2019un professionnel est environ de 30 mains par heure, soit 300 mains par session quotidienne de dix heures par session et 1 500 mains pour une semaine de 50 heures alors que les joueurs professionnels en ligne vont normalement jouer 50 mains \u00e0 l\u2019heure, et ce, pour chaque table \u00e0 laquelle ils jouent.\n[88] La seconde source de confusion concerne le nombre de tables auxquelles un joueur peut jouer en ligne simultan\u00e9ment. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, les joueurs exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s peuvent facilement jouer \u00e0 quatre tables \u00e0 la fois et certains joueurs peuvent m\u00eame jouer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 tables et plus en m\u00eame temps. Un joueur qui joue \u00e0 quatre tables simultan\u00e9ment pendant dix heures par jour et cinq jours par semaine aura jouer 10 000 mains dans une semaine (soit 50 mains \u00e0 l\u2019heure x 4 tables x 10 heures par jour x 5 jours par semaine).\n[89] La troisi\u00e8me source de confusion concerne le rythme de jeu annuel de l\u2019appelant parce que les experts se concentrent uniquement sur les donn\u00e9es obtenues de HandHQ, qui r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 une seule suite de jeu (PokerStars) et seulement pour les mises de 0.50 \u00a2\/1 $ \u00e0 10 $\/20 $ et pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois se terminant en mars 2011. Dans le cas de l\u2019appelant, seulement 92 653 mains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en compte alors qu\u2019il a reconnu avoir jou\u00e9 intens\u00e9ment sur au moins deux autres sites, soit sur Full Tilt Pocker et PartyPoker. Par cons\u00e9quent, le nombre de mains jou\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte ne repr\u00e9sente qu\u2019une infime partie du nombre de mains r\u00e9ellement jou\u00e9es dans une ann\u00e9e.\n[90] L\u2019expert Heeb a apport\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions concernant le taux de commission exig\u00e9 par le site PokerStars (le \u00ab rake \u00bb) parce que le Dr. Dufour a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que ce taux \u00e9tait de 5 % des mises. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, ce taux est incorrect et a pour effet de biaiser substantiellement l\u2019impact du \u00ab rake \u00bb. Le taux r\u00e9el du \u00ab rake \u00bb exig\u00e9 par le site PokerStars est d\u2019environ 5% jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un maximum de 3 $ pour les mises de 5 $\/10 $ et de 10 $\/20 $. Lorsque le pot d\u2019une partie atteint 60 $, il n\u2019y a pas de \u00ab rake \u00bb additionnel. L\u2019effet du \u00ab rake \u00bb par main par joueur pour la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les donn\u00e9es de PokerStars sont disponibles est de 0.18 \u00a2 par main par joueur pour les mises de 10 $\/20 $ et de 0.16 \u00a2 par main par joueur pour les mises de 5 $\/10 $.\nVII. Expertises pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant\n[91] Un premier expert mandat\u00e9 par le procureur de l\u2019appelant est monsieur Jeffrey S. Rosenthal, lequel d\u00e9tient un BSc en math\u00e9matiques et physique et en science informatique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto (1988) et un doctorat en math\u00e9matiques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Harvard (1992). Depuis 1993, il est professeur de statistiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto.\n[92] Son mandat consistait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les contributions relatives du facteur habilet\u00e9 et du facteur chance des joueurs de poker en ligne et, en particulier de r\u00e9viser et commenter les diff\u00e9rents rapports et conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb dans le cadre du litige de l\u2019appelant avec l\u2019ARC. Le professeur Rosenthal a produit un rapport dat\u00e9 du 19 octobre 2020 et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Pour ex\u00e9cuter son mandat, le professeur Rosenthal a eu acc\u00e8s aux diff\u00e9rents rapports de l\u2019expert Heeb dans la cause Di Cristina et dans la cause de l\u2019appelant et de celles de messieurs Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re et Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des dossiers financiers et \u00e0 des courriels concernant les gains et les pertes de l\u2019appelant r\u00e9sultant de son jeu en ligne et aux donn\u00e9es d\u00e9taill\u00e9es portant sur les 187 millions de parties jou\u00e9es en ligne sur le site de PokerStars au cours de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019avril 2020 \u00e0 mars 2011.\n[93] Essentiellement, la position du professeur Rosenthal est que les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant est un joueur extr\u00eamement habile et que cette habilet\u00e9 domine grandement sur le facteur chance apr\u00e8s quelques milliers de mains ne sont pas ad\u00e9quatement d\u00e9montr\u00e9es et sont m\u00eames contredites par les r\u00e9sultats r\u00e9els obtenus par l\u2019appelant, lesquels montrent des probabilit\u00e9s significatives de pertes et de longues p\u00e9riodes de pertes substantielles.\n[94] Le professeur Rosenthal a observ\u00e9 une circularit\u00e9 dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019expert Heeb en ce sens que les joueurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s dans diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories et \u00e9valu\u00e9s en utilisant les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. La m\u00eame chose s\u2019est produite afin de mesurer les statistiques du mod\u00e8le de paris et les gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au poker.\n[95] Dans le cas particulier de l\u2019appelant, le professeur Rosenthal a observ\u00e9 que son pourcentage d\u2019habilet\u00e9, calcul\u00e9 selon la formule de l\u2019expert Heeb, \u00e9tait estim\u00e9 \u00eatre 0 %, de 45.5 % (sur une base mensuelle), de 33.3 % (sur une base des profits nets annuels) et de 82.9 % des profits annuels totaux pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient disponibles, l\u2019appelant a connu une longue p\u00e9riode de pertes ce qui n\u2019est pas conforme aux mod\u00e8les de gains con\u00e7us par l\u2019expert Heeb pour les joueurs les plus habiles. Au niveau recommand\u00e9 de 3 000 mains, le pourcentage d\u2019habilet\u00e9 estim\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas 19.4 %.\n[96] Le deuxi\u00e8me expert mandat\u00e9 par le procureur de l\u2019appelant est le Dr. Matthieu Dufour lequel d\u00e9tient un doctorat en math\u00e9matiques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et est un associ\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des actuaires. Monsieur Dufour est depuis 2001 professeur d\u2019actuariat au D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et il a publi\u00e9 plusieurs articles sur la th\u00e9orie des jeux.\n[97] Son mandat, \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert ind\u00e9pendant en math\u00e9matiques, en th\u00e9orie des jeux, en th\u00e9orie des probabilit\u00e9s et en action actuariat, \u00e9tait d\u2019analyser et de d\u00e9terminer la part du hasard dans le r\u00e9sultat du jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em et d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il est possible d\u2019y jouer avec une esp\u00e9rance de gain positive \u00e0 long terme.\n[98] Le professeur Dufour a produit un rapport dat\u00e9 11 juin 2021 de m\u00eame qu\u2019une r\u00e9plique dat\u00e9e du 11 ao\u00fbt 2021 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 son rapport. Pour ex\u00e9cuter son mandat, le professeur Dufour a eu acc\u00e8s aux avis d\u2019appel et aux r\u00e9ponses aux avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019appelant et \u00e0 tous les rapports d\u2019expertise produits par l\u2019expert Heeb et par le professeur Rosenthal dans le dossier de l\u2019appelant.\n[99] Le professeur Dufour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Son t\u00e9moignage et son rapport ont fait ressortir trois principaux points de d\u00e9saccord avec les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb. Ces points de d\u00e9saccord sont les suivants :\n- les crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019expert Heeb ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants et ils constituent tous des variations d\u2019un seul et m\u00eame crit\u00e8re, i.e., la constatation qu\u2019en moyenne, les meilleurs joueurs de son \u00e9chantillon font mieux que les moins bons. L\u2019habilit\u00e9 des joueurs peut justifier une certaine part de leurs succ\u00e8s, mais la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019expert Heeb au moyen de ses graphiques, est erron\u00e9e, car les m\u00eames types de graphiques sont obtenus avec des r\u00e9sultats purement al\u00e9atoires pour lesquels seul le hasard est en cause;\n- en aucun moment, l\u2019expert Heeb a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019habilit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante sur la chance au poker;\n- \u00ab la mesure de contribution de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb d\u2019un joueur de poker, telle qu\u2019\u00e9labor\u00e9e par l\u2019expert Heeb, ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 aucun des crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une mesure statistique robuste et fiable, \u00e0 savoir une d\u00e9finition non ambig\u00fce, l\u2019existence d\u2019un intervalle de confiance (marge d\u2019erreur), une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 mesurer la chose voulue et une coh\u00e9rence dans les r\u00e9sultats (valeurs n\u00e9gatives);\n- le professeur Dufour a \u00e9galement conclu que l\u2019analyse des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019appelant pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019avril 2010 \u00e0 mars 2011 de 0.17 \u00a2 par main lui procure une probabilit\u00e9 a priori de terminer l\u2019ann\u00e9e avec au moins le gain qu\u2019il a obtenu n\u2019est que de 41.6 %, ce qui est absolument non remarquable et ne ressort nullement de la moyenne;\n- dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019expert Heeb, le professeurDufour a notamment trait\u00e9 des questions suivantes :\n- la confusion entourant les conclusions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que \u00ab Il y a au poker de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb (conclusion courte) et \u00ab Au poker, l\u2019habilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9domine \u00bb (conclusion erron\u00e9e);\n- le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la \u00ab mesure d\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb; et\n- la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un joueur aguerri \u00e0 tirer parti des faiblesses de ses adversaires dans le jeu en ligne.\n[100] Concernant la \u00ab pr\u00e9dominance de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb, le professeur Dufour a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019expert Heeb n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la signification de cette notion.\n[101] Concernant le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la \u00ab mesure d\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb, le professeur Dufour a soutenu que ce test ne respecte pas les standards minimums de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 pour un test statistique, notamment \u00e0 cause de l\u2019absence de toute mesure d\u2019intervalle de confiance qui viendrait valider ce test.\n[102] Concernant la capacit\u00e9 pour un joueur aguerri \u00e0 tirer parti des faiblesses de ses adversaires dans le jeu en ligne, le professeur Dufour a affirm\u00e9, en se basant sur les th\u00e9or\u00e8mes math\u00e9matiques de la th\u00e9orie des jeux, que la chance \u00e9tait largement dominante dans le succ\u00e8s d\u2019un joueur et que, pour cette raison, il faut un grand nombre de mains pour qu\u2019un joueur beaucoup plus fort qu\u2019un autre finisse par l\u2019emporter de fa\u00e7on convaincante. Selon lui, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait un talent particulier qui lui permettait de d\u00e9tecter si ses adversaires en ligne bluffaient ou non.\nVIII. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables\n[103] Les dispositions de la Loi applicables au pr\u00e9sent litige sont l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3a), le paragraphe 9(1), l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) et le paragraphe 248(1).\n[104] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 3a) pr\u00e9voit que, dans le calcul de son revenu, le contribuable doit inclure le revenu provenant d\u2019une source au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, y compris le revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise. Le paragraphe 9(1) pr\u00e9voit que le revenu que le contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) pr\u00e9voit que le gain ou la perte d\u2019un contribuable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition d\u2019une chance de gagner un prix ou un pari ou d\u2019un droit de recevoir une somme comme prix ou comme enjeu d\u2019un pari est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre nul. Le paragraphe 248(1) pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab entreprise \u00bb comprend les professions de m\u00eame que les activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial.\n[105] Ces dispositions de la Loi se lisent comme suit :\nRevenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition\n3 Pour d\u00e9terminer le revenu d\u2019un contribuable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, les calculs suivants sont \u00e0 effectuer :\na) le calcul du total des sommes qui constituent chacune le revenu du contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e (autre qu\u2019un gain en capital imposable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition d\u2019un bien) dont la source se situe au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, y compris, sans que soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le revenu tir\u00e9 de chaque charge, emploi, entreprise et bien;\nRevenu\n9 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente partie, le revenu qu\u2019un contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e.\nPerte\n(2) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 31, la perte subie par un contribuable au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition relativement \u00e0 une entreprise ou \u00e0 un bien est le montant de sa perte subie au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 cette entreprise ou \u00e0 ce bien, calcul\u00e9e par l\u2019application, avec les adaptations n\u00e9cessaires, des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi aff\u00e9rentes au calcul du revenu tir\u00e9 de cette entreprise ou de ce bien.\n[\u2026]\n40(2) f) est nul le gain ou la perte du contribuable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition :\n(i) soit d\u2019une chance de gagner un prix ou un pari,\n(ii) soit d\u2019un droit de recevoir une somme comme prix ou comme enjeu d\u2019un pari,\n\u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une loterie ou d\u2019un pari collectif mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 205 du Code criminel;\n[\u2026]\n248(1) entreprise Sont compris parmi les entreprises les professions, m\u00e9tiers, commerces, industries ou activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et, sauf pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(2)c), de l\u2019article 54.2, du paragraphe 95(1) et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 110.6(14)f), les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion toutefois d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi. (business)\nIX. Analyse et conclusion\n[106] Il ne fait aucun doute que le jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em sans limite est un jeu de hasard et d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Les experts retenus par les parties s\u2019entendent sur ce point. Le d\u00e9saccord entre les experts porte essentiellement sur les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 pr\u00e9vaut sur le hasard.\n[107] Cette question, quoique tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante, n\u2019est pas vraiment pertinente pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant exploitait ou non une entreprise au cours des ann\u00e9es en litige, parce que, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelant, le poker n\u2019est pas un jeu de type \u00ab pari \u00bb vis\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) de la Loi. Le droit de recevoir une somme comme enjeu d\u2019un pari n\u2019est pas gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une loterie ou d\u2019un pari collectif mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 205 du code criminel. Mentionnons ici que l\u2019article 205 du code criminel a par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli par la loi de 1985, L.R. ch. 52 (1er suppl.) a.1, sanctionn\u00e9 le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1985.\n[108] D\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les parties s\u2019entendent sur les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 utiliser pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant exploitait ou non une entreprise (voir les paragraphes 13 \u00e0 22 et les paragraphes 31 \u00e0 37). Leurs divergences proviennent de l\u2019application de ces crit\u00e8res aux faits qui sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019appelant.\n[109] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 et 2012, les activit\u00e9s de poker de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient beaucoup plus qu\u2019un divertissement. Il jouait au poker pour gagner sa vie; en ce sens, il \u00e9tait un joueur de poker professionnel. Il jouait au poker de fa\u00e7on non r\u00e9cr\u00e9ative dans le but de d\u00e9gager un profit. Il organisait sa vie en fonction du poker. Il jouait m\u00eame en vacances et il payait ses voyages avec ses gains de poker.\n[110] Les activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker de l\u2019appelant repr\u00e9sentaient sa seule source de revenus au cours des ann\u00e9es en litige.\n[111] Selon le rapport de v\u00e9rification, les revenus non-d\u00e9clar\u00e9s de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008 \u00e0 2011, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis seulement \u00e0 partir du site de PartyPoker, repr\u00e9sentent au minimum 3 219 074 $. Rappelons ici que le site PartyPoker n\u2019est que l\u2019un des trois sites de poker en ligne sur lesquels l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9.\n[112] Dans les faits, l\u2019appelant consacrait la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de son temps au jeu de poker. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les informations fournies par le site PartyPoker. L\u2019appelant a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des parties de poker en ligne sur le site \u00e0 raison de 330 jours en 2008, 307 jours en 2009, 265 jours en 2010 et 266 jours en 2011. D\u2019apr\u00e8s un \u00e9chantillonnage effectu\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008, l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9 pour une moyenne variant entre 30 et 56 heures par semaine toujours sur le seul site de PartyPoker. Ces heures de jeu ne tiennent pas compte des heures consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la formation de l\u2019appelant, \u00e0 ses analyses des autres joueurs et \u00e0 ses participations aux forums de discussions.\n[113] \u00c0 l\u2019aide de ses gains de poker, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une immobilisation importante, \u00e0 savoir une r\u00e9sidence acquise le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2010 pour un co\u00fbt total de 530 000 $, pay\u00e9 comptant.\n[114] L\u2019appelant a utilis\u00e9 le logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager lorsqu\u2019il jouait au poker en ligne. Ce logiciel lui permettait de conserver ses statistiques de jeux, son historique de jeux et de nombreuses autres donn\u00e9es pertinentes \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de poker, en plus de fournir des informations concernant les joueurs contre qui il a jou\u00e9. A l\u2019aide de ce logiciel, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019identifier des joueurs contre qui il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de ne pas jouer et ceux contre qui il lui \u00e9tait plus profitable de jouer.\n[115] Malgr\u00e9 son mode de vie hors normes et sa propension \u00e0 toujours vouloir ridiculiser ses adversaires, l\u2019appelant avait un comportement d\u2019hommes d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux. Il n\u2019avait pas besoin de registres comptables, ni de plans d\u2019affaires. Il jouait pour gagner et il savait comment atteindre son but. Il \u00e9vitait de jouer contre certains joueurs ou il jouait avec plus de prudence. Il adaptait son jeu en fonction de son \u00ab bankroll \u00bb) pour \u00e9viter les situations trop p\u00e9rilleuses. L\u2019appelant a adopt\u00e9 des normes objectives de gestion et de minimisation des risques. Il jouait sur plusieurs tables \u00e0 la fois dans le but de maximiser ses possibilit\u00e9s de gains dans le plus court laps de temps de jeu.\n[116] \u00c0 ce niveau de gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant sur une aussi longue p\u00e9riode de temps, je suis convaincu que l\u2019appelant pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 pouvoir gagner sa vie en jouant au poker et m\u00eame de faire une carri\u00e8re de joueur professionnel. Dans l\u2019acte d\u2019achat de la r\u00e9sidence acquise par l\u2019appelant en 2010, l\u2019appelant est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un joueur de poker professionnel. L\u2019appelant a de plus mis fin \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes en actuariat pour se consacrer enti\u00e8rement au jeu de poker.\n[117] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je viens \u00e0 la conclusion que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019appelant avait l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit en s\u2019adonnant \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de poker et qu\u2019il utilisait son expertise et ses habilit\u00e9s pour gagner sa vie au poker, un jeu de hasard o\u00f9 l\u2019habilit\u00e9 entre fortement en ligne de compte.\n[118] Pour toutes ces raisons, (a) l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie en date du 25 mai 2012 concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008 est rejet\u00e9 sans frais, et (b) les appels \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablis en date du 16 octobre 2012 concernant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011 sont accueillis en partie sans frais et lesdites cotisations sont d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la ministre du Revenu national pour nouvel examen et nouvelles cotisations afin de diminuer le revenu imposable de l\u2019appelant des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011 d\u2019un montant de 206 920 $, de 48 939 $ et de 3 367 $ respectivement.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, ce 25e jour de janvier 2023.\n\u00ab R\u00e9al Favreau \u00bb\nJuge Favreau\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 12\nN\u00ba DES DOSSIERS DE LA COUR :\n2014-123 (IT)G\n2014-461(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nAntoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nQu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nles 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22 et 23 septembre 2021\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL'honorable juge R\u00e9al Favreau\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 25 janvier 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats de l\u2019appelant :\nMe Danny Galarneau\nMe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Dupuis\nAvocats de l'intim\u00e9e :\nMe Gr\u00e9goire Cadieux\nMe Sonia B\u00e9dard\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant:\nNom :\nMe Danny Galarneau\nMe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Dupuis\nCabinet :\nCain Lamarre (SENCRL)\nFasken Martineau DuMoulin (SENCRL)\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle\nSous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

Le signataire desdits formulaires n\u2019exigeait pas de re\u00e7us pour les montants de d\u00e9penses d\u00e9clar\u00e9es.\n[11] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son quart de travail quotidien consistait en plus de 12 heures de travail et il a fourni les renseignements d\u2019appui sur ces itin\u00e9raires sp\u00e9cifiques. Lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur son quart de travail quotidien, l\u2019appelant a reconnu que bon nombre de ses itin\u00e9raires prenaient moins de 12 heures et faisaient l\u2019objet de quarts de travail fractionn\u00e9s avec des temps d\u2019interruption de deux (2) \u00e0 quatre (4) heures.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) et le paragraphe 8(2) de la Loi pour rejeter les demandes de d\u00e9ductions des d\u00e9penses d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelant. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) et le paragraphe 8(2) de la Loi sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s comme suit :\nEmploy\u00e9s des entreprises de transport\n(g) lorsque le contribuable a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par une personne dont la principale activit\u00e9 d\u2019entreprise \u00e9tait le transport de voyageurs, de marchandises, ou de voyageurs et marchandises et que les fonctions de son emploi l\u2019obligeaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement :\n(i) d\u2019une part, \u00e0 voyager \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la municipalit\u00e9 dans laquelle \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de son employeur o\u00f9 il devait se pr\u00e9senter pour son travail, et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, hors de la r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine o\u00f9 \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 cet \u00e9tablissement, dans des v\u00e9hicules utilis\u00e9s par l\u2019employeur pour transporter les voyageurs ou marchandises,\n(ii) d\u2019autre part, pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de cette municipalit\u00e9 et r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine, \u00e0 engager des frais pour ses repas et son logement,\nles sommes que le contribuable a ainsi d\u00e9bours\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre rembours\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard;\nRestriction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\n(2) Seuls les montants pr\u00e9vus au pr\u00e9sent article sont d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable tir\u00e9, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi.\n[13] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) a pr\u00e9vu un all\u00e8gement pour ces personnes qui sont employ\u00e9es dans le secteur des transports et qui doivent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement s\u00e9journer \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de leur municipalit\u00e9.\n[14] Dans l\u2019affaire Robert Elwood c. La Reine (2012 CCI 313), la juge Campbell d\u00e9crit les conditions de l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) comme suit :\n9 [traduction] Les conditions pr\u00e9alables qui doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)(g) doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 sont les suivantes : (1) L\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de l\u2019employeur doit \u00eatre le transport de passagers, de marchandises ou une combinaison de passagers et de marchandises. (2) Le contribuable doit, pour s\u2019acquitter de ses fonctions professionnelles, voyager r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la municipalit\u00e9 dans laquelle se trouve l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019employeur o\u00f9 il se pr\u00e9sente au travail. (3) Le contribuable doit voyager dans des v\u00e9hicules utilis\u00e9s par l\u2019employeur pour transporter ces marchandises ou passagers. (4) Le contribuable doit, pour s\u2019acquitter de ses fonctions professionnelles, voyager r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement hors de la r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine dans laquelle se trouve l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019employeur o\u00f9 il se pr\u00e9sente au travail. (5) Enfin, le contribuable doit, pour s\u2019acquitter de ses fonctions professionnelles engager des frais pour ses repas et son h\u00e9bergement pendant qu\u2019il est ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de cette municipalit\u00e9 et r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine. Si ces conditions pr\u00e9alables sont satisfaites, le contribuable peut d\u00e9duire les montants engag\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 et n\u2019est pas autrement en droit d\u2019\u00eatre rembours\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre.\n[15] Dans les cas de ce type, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9montrer que la nouvelle cotisation est erron\u00e9e et cela peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. De plus, comme l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) est une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de la restriction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du paragraphe 8(2) de la Loi, il devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re stricte.\n[16] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont je dispose, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que ses fonctions professionnelles exigeaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement qu\u2019il voyage \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019Oshawa et de la r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine o\u00f9 se trouve son employeur et que quand il en \u00e9tait ainsi absent, il engage des frais pour ses repas et son h\u00e9bergement.\n[17] La ville d\u2019Oshawa est situ\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion de Durham, elle-m\u00eame situ\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que les d\u00e9penses d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019il se trouvait en dehors de la r\u00e9gion m\u00e9tropolitaine dans laquelle il se pr\u00e9sente au travail.\n[18] L\u2019application des d\u00e9ductions au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)g) de la Loi ne s\u2019adresse pas aux employ\u00e9s qui d\u00e9cident, pour des raisons personnelles, de ne pas retourner chez eux \u00e0 la fin de chaque journ\u00e9e de travail.\n[19] Pour tous ces motifs, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec), ce 25e jour de janvier 2023.\n\u00ab R\u00e9al Favreau \u00bb\nLe juge Favreau\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 15\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2017-3876(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nJOHN MICHALUK ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nToronto (Ontario)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 17 ao\u00fbt 2022\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT :\nL\u2019honorable juge R\u00e9al Favreau\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 25 janvier 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats de l\u2019appelant :\nMe Avery Kalpin\nMe Jeff Kirshen\nAvocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe George Lin\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nNom :\nMe Avery Kalpin\nMe Jeff Kirshen\nCabinet :\nRosen Kirshen Tax Law\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle\nSous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

La repr\u00e9sentante du d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9crit au tribunal pour dire que le ministre ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la demande.\nLes demandes de prorogation de d\u00e9lai sont r\u00e9gies par l\u2019article 167 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et le paragraphe 167(5) \u00e9nonce les exigences pour rendre une ordonnance. Ce paragraphe est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 comme suit :\n(5) Acceptation de la demande \u2014 Il n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai imparti en vertu de l\u2019article 169 pour interjeter appel;\nb) le contribuable d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\n(i) dans le d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour interjeter appel,\nil n\u2019a pu ni agir ni charger quelqu\u2019un pour agir en son nom,\nou il avait v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019intention d\u2019interjeter appel,\n(ii) compte tenu des raisons invoqu\u00e9es dans la demande et des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 sa demande,\n(iii) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient,\n(iv) l\u2019appel est raisonnablement fond\u00e9.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nEn r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, lorsqu\u2019une demande ne fait pas l\u2019objet d\u2019une opposition et qu\u2019\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, il semblerait que les conditions soient remplies, le tribunal accorde la prorogation du d\u00e9lai.\nCependant, il est bien \u00e9tabli que les parties ne peuvent pas \u00e9tendre la comp\u00e9tence de la cour et il revient ultimement \u00e0 notre Cour de conclure que les conditions sont remplies.\nLe juge Webb, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnston c. La Reine[1] :\n\u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019exigence l\u00e9gislative voulant que le demandeur d\u00e9montre que l\u2019appel est raisonnablement fond\u00e9 est une condition qu\u2019il faut remplir pour que la Cour ait comp\u00e9tence en vue de rendre l\u2019ordonnance prorogeant le d\u00e9lai dans lequel un appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 et il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une exigence \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut renoncer. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une exigence qui est impos\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019exigence voulant que le demandeur d\u00e9montre que l\u2019appel est raisonnablement fond\u00e9 est une condition \u00e0 remplir pour que la Cour rende l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e.\nJ\u2019abonde dans le m\u00eame sens.\nSans compter la page de signature, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel propos\u00e9 ci-joint contient huit pages avec peu de faits et beaucoup d\u2019arguments. Il invoque notamment la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques et le Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, ainsi que plusieurs d\u00e9cisions judiciaires.\nL\u2019essentiel de la th\u00e8se du demandeur semble \u00eatre le suivant :\nIl est ill\u00e9galement contraint d\u2019accepter le statut de personne morale. En outre, il a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre reconnu uniquement comme un \u00eatre humain.\nBien qu\u2019exprim\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re quelque peu diff\u00e9rente, cela ressemble de mani\u00e8re frappante \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on a souvent appel\u00e9 les arguments relatifs aux \u00ab personnes physiques \u00bb.\nLe seuil \u00e0 franchir pour que \u00ab l\u2019appel [soit] raisonnablement fond\u00e9 \u00bb n\u2019est pas \u00e9lev\u00e9. Voir, par exemple, les commentaires du juge Smith dans la d\u00e9cision Johnson c. La Reine.

Houle s\u2019est vu conf\u00e9rer, \u00e0 titre d\u2019actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, un avantage de 96 734 $ au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011?\n[7] Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, la Cour devra r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question suivante :\n- Est-ce \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre a conclu, en utilisant uniquement la diff\u00e9rence entre les soldes de d\u00e9but et de fin d\u2019exercice du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

LES TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES\nA. La th\u00e8se de M. Houle\n[9] La th\u00e8se de M. Houle peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit :\n- L\u2019avocat de M. Houle soutient que le ministre ne pouvait pas conclure qu\u2019un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle en utilisant uniquement la diff\u00e9rence entre les soldes de d\u00e9but et de fin d\u2019exercice du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Selon lui, le ministre ne pouvait pas tirer une telle conclusion, car il ne s\u2019agit que de simples \u00e9critures comptables. Il soutient que M. Houle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u 96 734 $ de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne lui a pas conf\u00e9r\u00e9 ce montant comme avantage [5] . Si la Cour devait conclure que le ministre pouvait tirer une telle conclusion, l\u2019avocat de M. Houle soutient avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ce dernier n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u 96 734 $ de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00c0 ce sujet, il soutient \u00e9galement avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les sommes que M. Houle a re\u00e7ues de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011 \u00e9taient des remboursements d\u2019avances faites par M. Houle au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes [6] .\nB. La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[10] La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit :\n- L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que M. Houle n\u2019a pas avanc\u00e9 96 374 $ \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours de son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011 [7] . Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Houle a augment\u00e9 artificiellement le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb afin de permettre \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de lui verser des montants libres d\u2019imp\u00f4t [8] . Par cons\u00e9quent, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Houle s\u2019est appropri\u00e9 96 374 $ de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n- L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le ministre a tenu compte des soldes du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb uniquement pour l\u2019exercice 2011 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Selon le ministre, la seule analyse pertinente est celle ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice 2011 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et non aux exercices ant\u00e9rieurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019analyse effectu\u00e9e par M. Houle concernant les exercices de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2011 n\u2019est pas pertinente [9] .\nV. LES FAITS\n[11] Au cours de ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011, M. Houle \u00e9tait le seul actionnaire et administrateur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les activit\u00e9s principales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient la vente de pi\u00e8ces de monnaie de collection ainsi que l\u2019achat et la vente de pi\u00e8ces de collection (voitures miniatures, blousons de Nascar, timbres, etc.) [10] . L\u2019exercice de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se termine le 30 avril de chaque ann\u00e9e [11] .\n[12] Le ministre a d\u2019abord ajout\u00e9 107 486 $ au revenu de M. Houle pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011. Avant d\u2019agir ainsi, l\u2019ARC a examin\u00e9 certains documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par le comptable de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Or, selon les \u00e9critures comptables de r\u00e9gularisation de fin d\u2019exercice de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la balance de v\u00e9rification comprise dans ces documents, le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019exercice 2011 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait de 107 486 $. La preuve d\u00e9montre que l\u2019ARC a conclu que M. Houle s\u2019est vu conf\u00e9rer un avantage de 107 486 $ sans avoir \u00e9tabli au pr\u00e9alable si cette somme lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e [12] . La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que l\u2019ARC a conclu que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle cet avantage apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les \u00e9critures comptables \u00ab de r\u00e9gularisation de fin d\u2019exercice \u00bb et la \u00ab balance de v\u00e9rification \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [13] . Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Th\u00e9audi\u00e8re, ces \u00e9critures ont vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le comptable afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir le solde de fin d\u2019exercice du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour 2011 [14] .\n[13] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Houle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour un fichier Excel qui comprenait plusieurs tableaux exposant les d\u00e9penses de M. Houle pour le compte de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 1999 \u00e0 2008 inclusivement [15] . Selon M. Houle, il aurait avanc\u00e9 379 980 $ \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode [16] .\nVI. DISCUSSION\nA. La somme en cause\n[14] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Th\u00e9audi\u00e8re a admis avoir constat\u00e9 une erreur dans les \u00e9critures comptables de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lors de sa pr\u00e9paration en vue du proc\u00e8s. Selon Mme Th\u00e9audi\u00e8re, \u00e0 cause de cette erreur, il aurait fallu soustraire 34 352 $ de la somme ajout\u00e9e au revenu de M. Houle. Par cons\u00e9quent, il aurait fallu ajouter 62 382 $ (soit 96 374 $ - 34 352 $) au revenu de M. Houle [17] . Lors des plaidoiries, l\u2019avocat de M. Houle a port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la Cour des erreurs comptables suppl\u00e9mentaires. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 rapidement ces erreurs possibles, la Cour a conclu que certaines sommes apparaissant au bilan de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011 semblaient effectivement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es par erreur \u00e0 la \u00ab balance de v\u00e9rification \u00bb [18] . Selon la preuve, une fois ces erreurs corrig\u00e9es, il faudrait soustraire 26 351 $ du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb [19] . Afin de confirmer que tel \u00e9tait le cas, la Cour a exceptionnellement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Th\u00e9audi\u00e8re de revenir \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins afin d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9claircissements. Mme Th\u00e9audi\u00e8re a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait bel et bien d\u2019erreurs et que si ces erreurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 son attention plus t\u00f4t, elle aurait modifi\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage. En tenant compte de ces erreurs, elle aurait admis que le montant de l\u2019avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle devait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit de nouveau \u00e0 36 029,90 $ (soit 62 382 $ - 26 351 $) [20] .\n[15] Compte tenu de ceci, la Cour conclut que le montant de l\u2019avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle faisant l\u2019objet du litige est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 36 029,90 $.\nB. Est-ce \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre a conclu qu\u2019un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle en tenant uniquement compte des soldes du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9?\n[16] En vertu du paragraphe 15(1) de la LIR, un actionnaire doit inclure dans le calcul de son revenu la valeur de l\u2019avantage que lui conf\u00e8re une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il est actionnaire. Le verbe \u00ab conf\u00e9rer \u00bb signifie \u00ab accorder \u00bb ou \u00ab attribuer \u00bb [21] .\n[17] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lalibert\u00e9 c. La Reine [22] , la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9crit l\u2019analyse devant \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9cider si un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire au sens du paragraphe 15(1) de la LIR. Selon la Cour, l\u2019analyse devant \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e comporte trois \u00e9tapes :\n1- d\u00e9terminer si un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire;\n2- d\u00e9terminer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la teneur de l\u2019avantage;\n3- d\u00e9terminer la valeur de l\u2019avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire en fonction de ce qu\u2019il lui en aurait co\u00fbt\u00e9 s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un actionnaire [23] .\n[18] Il faut noter que cette analyse est intrins\u00e8quement factuelle [24] .\n(1) La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse : D\u00e9terminer si un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Houle en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire?\n[19] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour doit d\u00e9cider si le ministre pouvait conclure si M. Houle s\u2019est vu conf\u00e9rer un avantage en tenant uniquement compte des soldes de d\u00e9but et de fin d\u2019exercice ann\u00e9e du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de celle-ci.\n[20] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Houle, le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 correspond au total des sommes suivantes : toutes les avances qu\u2019il a faites \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours de son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011, y compris les d\u00e9penses de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9es avec sa carte de cr\u00e9dit personnelle au cours de cette ann\u00e9e [25] .\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la preuve d\u00e9montre que M. Houle n\u2019a pas avanc\u00e9 ces sommes \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 certaines de ces d\u00e9penses avec sa carte de cr\u00e9dit personnelle. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019\u00e9critures comptables, le comptable de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment augment\u00e9 artificiellement le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce stratag\u00e8me aurait permis \u00e0 M. Houle de se faire rembourser plus tard des avances qui n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les avances sont faites avec des sommes non imposables, lors de leur remboursement, M. Houle aurait re\u00e7u des sommes qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas avanc\u00e9es sans imp\u00f4t.\n[22] \u00c0 ce sujet, dans la d\u00e9cision Chaplin c. La Reine [26] , notre Cour a conclu ce qui suit :\n114 Cela dit, je ne suis pas convaincu que le simple fait de faire une fausse \u00e9criture comptable, m\u00eame sciemment, conf\u00e8re un avantage \u00e0 un actionnaire. Il me semble que l\u2019avantage est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un bien de valeur est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire. Tout au plus, une fausse \u00e9criture comptable jette les bases du d\u00e9guisement d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit futur ou de la dissimulation d\u2019une dette due par un actionnaire \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle ne constitue pas en soi un avantage [27] .\n[23] Je suis du m\u00eame avis. Le ministre ne peut pas conclure qu\u2019un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire uniquement en raison d\u2019\u00e9critures comptables fausses.\n[24] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a dit dans la d\u00e9cision Lalibert\u00e9 qu\u2019un avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 doit \u00eatre r\u00e9el et non une \u00ab fiction l\u00e9gale \u00bb [28] . Je suis d\u2019avis que ceci s\u2019applique aussi aux \u00ab fictions comptables \u00bb. J\u2019ajouterais que le terme \u00ab avantage \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fini par la LIR [29] , mais que ce terme est d\u00e9fini dans le dictionnaire Petit Robert [30] comme suit :\n\u00ab Ce qui est utile, profitable \u00bb\n[25] Quant au terme \u00ab profitable \u00bb, il renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de \u00ab tirer profit \u00bb de quelque chose et donc au terme \u00ab profit \u00bb. Ce terme est d\u00e9fini dans le Petit Robert [31] comme suit :\n\u00ab Augmentation des biens que l\u2019on poss\u00e8de, ou am\u00e9lioration de situation qui r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une activit\u00e9 \u00bb\n[26] La preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que M. Houle a re\u00e7u des montants de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au cours de ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de sommes qu\u2019il avait avanc\u00e9es \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019augmentation des biens en sa possession en raison de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et donc aucune am\u00e9lioration de sa situation financi\u00e8re. Compte tenu de ceci et de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour conclu que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun avantage \u00e0 M. Houle.\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision Dumais c. La Reine [32] de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale permet \u00e0 notre Cour de conclure qu\u2019un avantage au sens du paragraphe 15(1) de la LIR a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire en raison d\u2019une augmentation du solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. \u00c0 cette fin, il renvoie au passage suivant de la d\u00e9cision Dumais :\n11 Mais, dit le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce montant, non seulement n\u2019est-il pas disparu du passif du bilan de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il n\u2019a cess\u00e9 d\u2019augmenter dans les ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi. Il est pass\u00e9 de 22 522,82 $ en l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 \u00e0 26 022,30 $ en 2001, 27 043 $ en 2002, 37 371 $ en 2003 et 41 401 $ en 2004. Cons\u00e9quemment, soutient-il, la dette de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019appelante apparaissant toujours aux livres de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019appelante pouvait toujours demander le remboursement de celle-ci, sans cons\u00e9quences fiscales, \u00e0 titre d\u2019avances qui lui sont dues. De l\u00e0 l\u2019avantage au montant de 42 000 $ constitu\u00e9 du montant de 19 417,98 $ reconnu par l\u2019appelante et de la dette de 22 522,82 $ apparaissant aux \u00e9tats financiers de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000 et par la suite.\n12 La juge ne s\u2019est pas tromp\u00e9e en acceptant cet argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e que l\u2019appelante pouvait toujours se faire rembourser du montant de la dette non \u00e9teinte \u00e0 titre d\u2019avances qui lui sont dues par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [33] .\n[28] Je ne partage pas cet avis.\n[29] Dans l\u2019affaire Dumais, l\u2019unique actionnaire et administrateur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas pay\u00e9 le plein prix de vente d\u2019un immeuble que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lui avait vendu. L\u2019ARC a conclu que l\u2019actionnaire avait obtenu un avantage correspondant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de vente et la somme vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par l\u2019actionnaire pour l\u2019immeuble. L\u2019ARC avait au pr\u00e9alable conclu que le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rajust\u00e9 pour tenir compte de ce fait.\n[30] La question qui \u00e9tait devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de savoir si l\u2019ARC pouvait conclure qu\u2019un avantage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire en raison de l\u2019augmentation du solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, alors que l\u2019actionnaire n\u2019avait fait aucune avance au cours de cette ann\u00e9e. \u00c0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [34] , on constate que les soldes du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb prenaient en compte des sommes avanc\u00e9es par l\u2019actionnaire \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la question \u00e0 savoir si ces avances avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement faites n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en litige. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement pas question d\u2019\u00e9critures comptables fausses. Enfin, \u00e0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est impossible de pr\u00e9tendre que la Cour a conclu explicitement ou implicitement qu\u2019un avantage peut \u00eatre conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 15(1) de la LIR uniquement en raison d\u2019une augmentation du solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb.\n(2) Les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse\n[31] Puisque la Cour a conclu que la premi\u00e8re condition n\u2019est pas satisfaite pour que le paragraphe 15(1) de la LIR s\u2019applique, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur les deux autres \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse.\nVII. CONCLUSION\n[32] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour estime que le ministre ne peut pas conclure qu\u2019un avantage a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire au sens de l\u2019article 15(1) de la LIR uniquement en faisant la preuve qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite d\u2019\u00e9critures comptables fausses, le solde du compte \u00ab Payable \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9 artificiellement.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour juge que ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre a conclu que M. Houle s\u2019est vu conf\u00e9rer, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, un avantage de 96 734 $ au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011.\n[34] Pour cette raison, l\u2019appel est accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\n[35] Les cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre le 2 juillet 2013 pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2010 et 2011 sont renvoy\u00e9es au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelles cotisations en fonction de ce qui suit :\n- M. Houle ne s\u2019est pas vu conf\u00e9rer, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, un avantage de 64 489 $ au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2010;\n- M. Houle ne s\u2019est pas vu conf\u00e9rer, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, un avantage de 32 245 $ au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, Ontario, ce 14e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n\u00ab Sylvain Ouimet \u00bb\nJuge Ouimet\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 2\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2017-2243(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nG\u00c9RALD HOULE ET\nSA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nTrois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATES DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLes 1er et 2 juin 2022\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Sylvain Ouimet\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 14 f\u00e9vrier 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nMe Pierre-Marc Seers\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe Renaud Fioramore-Beaulieu\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nMe Pierre-Marc Seers\nCabinet :\nDaigle, avocats fiscalistes inc.\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle\nSous\u2011procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada\nOttawa, Canada\n[1] L.R.C.

Introduction\n[1] Il s'agit d'appels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par madame Monique Groulx \u00e0 l'encontre des nouvelles d\u00e9terminations et des nouvelles cotisations suivantes \u00e9mises en vertu des articles 122.6 et 122.61 et des paragraphes 118(1), 163(2) et 248(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, LRC 1985, c 1 (5e supp), (\u00ab LIR \u00bb) et l\u2019article 6302 du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu :\n(a) les nouvelles d\u00e9terminations dat\u00e9es du 19 juillet 2019 concernant l\u2019allocation canadienne pour enfants (\u00ab ACE \u00bb) pour les ann\u00e9es de base 2015, 2016 et 2017;\n(b) la nouvelle d\u00e9termination dat\u00e9e du 20 mai 2020 concernant l\u2019ACE pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e de base 2018; et\n(c) les nouvelles cotisations dat\u00e9es du 22 juillet 2019 concernant le cr\u00e9dit \u00e9quivalent pour personne enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 charge pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016, 2017 et 2018 et la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) LIR pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2016 et 2017.\n[2] Aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir et de maintenir les nouvelles cotisations et les nouvelles d\u00e9terminations faisant l'objet des pr\u00e9sents appels, la ministre du Revenu national (\u00ab ministre \u00bb) s'est fond\u00e9e sur les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait suivantes \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'avis d'appel :\na) l\u2019appelante est la m\u00e8re de deux enfants :\ni.

Madame Groulx t\u00e9moigne pour elle-m\u00eame et n\u2019a appel\u00e9 aucun autre t\u00e9moin. Monsieur Cournoyer est l\u2019unique t\u00e9moin appel\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas contre-interrog\u00e9 monsieur. La Cour estime que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante est cr\u00e9dible et bien que certaines explications sont h\u00e9sitantes ou impr\u00e9cises, la Cour accorde une fiabilit\u00e9 suffisante \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. Le t\u00e9moignage de monsieur Cournoyer s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 plus cibl\u00e9 puisque limit\u00e9 \u00e0 formuler des r\u00e9ponses aux questions qui lui \u00e9taient demand\u00e9es. La Cour estime que le t\u00e9moignage de monsieur Cournoyer est dans son ensemble cr\u00e9dible bien que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son t\u00e9moignage se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9s difficiles \u00e0 concilier notamment quant aux \u00e9v\u00e8nements co\u00efncidant avec les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en litige. Sous r\u00e9serve de ces remarques, les deux t\u00e9moignages sont retenus.\n[4] Lors de la tenue des questions pr\u00e9liminaires, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 au retrait de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour faute lourde vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 163(2) LIR et impos\u00e9e relativement aux ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017 de l\u2019appelante. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appel relativement \u00e0 chacune des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017 sera accueilli sur la base de cette concession.\nII. Question en litige\n[5] La seule question en litige consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si, durant les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en appel, l'appelante et monsieur Michel Cournoyer \u00e9taient conjoints de fait ou vivaient en union de fait aux fins de l\u2019article 122.6 LIR et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(1)b) LIR.\nIII. Contexte\n[6] Madame Groulx, enseignante retrait\u00e9e, explique qu'elle conna\u00eet monsieur Cournoyer depuis une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es. Au cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es pertinentes, monsieur Cournoyer occupe un emploi dans le secteur de la construction et de la r\u00e9novation \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il est sans emploi. \u00c0 cette p\u00e9riode, madame Groulx a d\u00e9j\u00e0 un premier fils Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric n\u00e9 en 1985. Elle fr\u00e9quente monsieur Cournoyer au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000 alors qu\u2019il occupe l\u2019appartement d\u2019un immeuble appartenant \u00e0 son p\u00e8re situ\u00e9 rue Joffre, Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec. Madame Groulx habite d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode rue Durocher, Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[7] En 2002, madame Groulx donne naissance \u00e0 Jacob. Monsieur Cournoyer est le p\u00e8re de Jacob. Bien que monsieur Cournoyer occupe toujours un appartement rue Joffre, Gatineau, leur relation est maintenant celle de conjoints de fait aux dires m\u00eames de l\u2019appelante. Monsieur Cournoyer est plus pr\u00e9sent dans le quotidien de la famille rue Durocher, Gatineau. Il est essentiellement pr\u00e9sent le jour rue Durocher, Gatineau en plus de nuits occasionnelles. Lorsqu\u2019il couche rue Durocher, Gatineau, le couple peut faire chambre \u00e0 part depuis la naissance de Jacob. L\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9s et n\u2019ont jamais discut\u00e9 de cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[8] En 2005, la situation se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore au point de n\u00e9cessiter une intervention polici\u00e8re entra\u00eenant le d\u00e9part pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 de monsieur de la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelante. Selon l\u2019appelante, cet \u00e9v\u00e8nement est le d\u00e9nouement d\u2019une situation conjugale se d\u00e9gradant depuis un certain temps. L\u2019appelante confirme qu\u2019\u00e0 compter de ce d\u00e9part ils ne seront plus des conjoints de fait, les visites de monsieur ont cess\u00e9 bien que monsieur puisse occasionnellement rendre visite \u00e0 Jacob seulement. Monsieur Cournoyer confirme lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019ils ne sont plus des conjoints de fait, mais h\u00e9site \u00e0 pouvoir confirmer l\u2019ann\u00e9e exacte bien que celle-ci se situe entre 2005 et 2008 au plus tard.\n[9] \u00c0 la suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re survenu en 2008, monsieur Cournoyer doit quitter rue Joffre, Gatineau. \u00c0 ce moment, l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer discute alors de la possibilit\u00e9 que madame loue \u00e0 monsieur une chambre rue Durocher, Gatineau. Ce \u00e0 quoi l\u2019appelante consentira. Madame Groulx a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lou\u00e9 une chambre dans le pass\u00e9 et pour cette raison est en mesure d\u2019appr\u00e9cier ce que cette d\u00e9cision peut entra\u00eener. Une pr\u00e9sence masculine, au surplus le p\u00e8re de Jacob, et l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re que la location devrait lui apporter sont les principaux motifs au soutien de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019appelante. La location d\u2019une chambre par monsieur Cournoyer se poursuivra au-del\u00e0 des ann\u00e9es et p\u00e9riodes en litige. Jacob demeure avec l\u2019appelante incluant au moment des p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige.\nIV. Position de l\u2019appelante\n[10] L\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que bien que monsieur Cournoyer pouvait louer une chambre chez elle, elle ne vivait pas en union de fait avec monsieur Cournoyer apr\u00e8s l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 qui correspond \u00e0 une intervention polici\u00e8re. La relation de conjoint de fait s\u2019est termin\u00e9e au plus tard au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 et n\u2019a jamais reprise depuis. La situation \u00e9conomique personnelle de madame et monsieur explique le fait que monsieur a lou\u00e9 une chambre chez elle bien que Jacob soit n\u00e9 de leur union en 2002. Elle ajoute que, pendant les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en litige, ils n\u2019ont jamais v\u00e9cu ensemble en tant que couple ou conjoints de fait. Elle constitue alors pour elle-m\u00eame et ses enfants son seul soutien. Monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019a jamais fait partie du m\u00e9nage pendant les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en litige et exception faite du loyer qu\u2019il lui verse pour la location d\u2019une chambre il ne lui a jamais fourni de soutien financier ou toute autre forme de soutien quel qu\u2019il soit pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[11] Bien que l\u2019appelante reconna\u00eet que la situation peut sembler peu commune, la situation r\u00e9elle est telle qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de relation conjugale impliquant monsieur Cournoyer et l\u2019appelante ni lieu de les consid\u00e9rer conjoints de fait au cours des p\u00e9riodes en litige. Bien qu\u2019elle sait ne pas \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019emp\u00eacher la libre pens\u00e9e chez les gens du quartier, l\u2019appelante affirme avoir toujours maintenu la m\u00eame position pour toute fin que ce soit relativement au lien bien que limit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle peut entretenir avec monsieur Cournoyer. Elle ne peut accepter que les autorit\u00e9s fiscales la consid\u00e8rent conjointe de fait de monsieur Cournoyer aux fins des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es en litige.\nV. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[12] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, au cours des p\u00e9riodes en litige, l\u2019appelante vivait dans une relation conjugale qui constitue une \u00ab union de fait \u00bb entre \u00ab conjoints de fait \u00bb tels que d\u00e9finis aux fins de la LIR. La pr\u00e9sence de monsieur Cournoyer dans la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelante, et le comportement et les relations que les parties ont entretenus au cours des p\u00e9riodes en litige soutiennent une situation de conjoints de faits telle que d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par les tribunaux. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence il faut tenir compte du revenu de monsieur Cournoyer dans le calcul des montants d\u2019ACE auxquels l\u2019appelante a droit tout au long de ces p\u00e9riodes. De plus, cette m\u00eame relation a pour effet d\u2019invalider l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante au cr\u00e9dit pour personne enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 charge vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(1)b) LIR pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016, 2017 et 2018.\nVI. Analyse\n[13] Aux fins de la sous-section a.1 de la Section E de la Partie I LIR, l\u2019ACE requiert qu\u2019il soit tenu compte aux fins de d\u00e9terminer le revenu modifi\u00e9 du particulier r\u00e9clamant l\u2019ACE le revenu de la personne qui \u00e9tait le conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Les conditions d\u2019application du cr\u00e9dit pour personne enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 charge vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(1)b) LIR requi\u00e8rent que le particulier ne vit pas en union de fait \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[14] Aux fins de l\u2019ACE, l'article 122.6 LIR d\u00e9finit \u00ab \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 \u00bb :\n\u00ab \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 \u00bb Personne qui, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, est l'\u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait d\u2019un particulier dont il ne vit pas s\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment. Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition, une personne n'est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme vivant s\u00e9par\u00e9e d'un particulier \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 que si elle vit s\u00e9par\u00e9e du particulier \u00e0 ce moment, pour cause d'\u00e9chec de leur mariage ou union de fait, pendant une p\u00e9riode d'au moins 90 jours qui comprend ce moment.\n(notre soulignement)\n[15] La d\u00e9finition de \u00ab union de fait \u00bb aux fins de la LIR se trouve au paragraphe 248(1) :\n\u00ab union de fait \u00bb Relation qui existe entre deux conjoints de fait. (common-law partnership)\n(notre soulignement)\nLa d\u00e9finition de \u00ab conjoint de fait \u00bb aux fins de la LIR se trouve au paragraphe 248(1) :\u00ab conjoint de fait \u00bb En ce qui concerne un contribuable \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, personne qui, \u00e0 ce moment, vit dans une relation conjugale avec le contribuable et qui, selon le cas :\na) a v\u00e9cu ainsi tout au long de la p\u00e9riode de douze mois se terminant avant ce moment;\nb) est le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re d'un enfant dont le contribuable est le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re, compte non tenu des alin\u00e9as 252(1)c) et e) ni du sous-alin\u00e9a 252(2)a)(iii).\nPour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition, les personnes qui, \u00e0 un moment quelconque, vivent ensemble dans une relation conjugale sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 apr\u00e8s ce moment, vivre ainsi sauf si, au moment donn\u00e9, elles vivaient s\u00e9par\u00e9es, pour cause d'\u00e9chec de leur relation, pendant une p\u00e9riode d'au moins 90 jours qui comprend le moment donn\u00e9.\n(notre soulignement)\n[16] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que l'appelante se consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre la conjointe de fait de monsieur Cournoyer jusqu\u2019au moment justifiant une intervention polici\u00e8re en 2005. Aux yeux de l\u2019appelante, la situation s\u2019\u00e9tait alors envenim\u00e9e \u00e0 un point de non\u2011retour pour le couple. Monsieur Cournoyer parle plut\u00f4t lors de son t\u00e9moignage d\u2019embrouilles pour expliquer la s\u00e9paration du couple.\n[17] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, pour \u00e9tablir qu'elle n'\u00e9tait plus conjointe de fait de monsieur Cournoyer et donner droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 chacune des p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige, l\u2019appelante doit d\u00e9montrer, qu'apr\u00e8s ce moment, elle vivait s\u00e9par\u00e9e de monsieur Cournoyer pour cause d'\u00e9chec de leur union de fait pendant une p\u00e9riode d'au moins 90 jours. Autrement dit, compte tenu de la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode en litige, l\u2019appelante aura gain de cause si elle est en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir que durant les p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige elle et monsieur Cournoyer ne vivaient plus dans une relation conjugale.\n[18] Pour d\u00e9terminer si l'appelante ne vivait plus dans une relation conjugale m\u00eame si elle vivait sous le m\u00eame toit que monsieur Cournoyer, il y a lieu de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux facteurs \u00e9labor\u00e9s dans Molodowich v Penttinen, (1980), 1980 CanLII 1537 (ON SC) [Molodowich], et confirm\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat M c H, [1999] 2 RCS 3 [M c H] et repris par cette Cour dans notamment Milot c Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, [1996] 1 CTC 2247 [Milot] et Aukstinaitis c Canada, 2008 CCI 104 [Aukstinaitis]. Notre Cour r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9galement aux d\u00e9cisions dans Pam Sanford c Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, [2001] DTC 12 (confirm\u00e9e en Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2002 DTC 7442) et Lavoie c Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, 2001 DTC 5083 (C.A. F\u00e9d.) qui a suivi la d\u00e9cision Milot.\n[19] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire M c H mentionne relativement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Molodowich :\n59 Molodowich c. Penttinen (1980), 1980 CanLII 1537 (ON SC), 17 R.F.L. (2d) 376 (C. dist. Ont.), \u00e9nonce les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9es de l\u2019union conjugale, soit le partage d\u2019un toit, les rapports personnels et sexuels, les services, les activit\u00e9s sociales, le soutien financier, les enfants et aussi l\u2019image soci\u00e9tale du couple. Toutefois, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers et que tous ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019union soit tenue pour conjugale. (\u2026) Pour \u00eatre vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition, ni les couples de sexe diff\u00e9rent ni les couples de m\u00eame sexe n\u2019ont besoin de se conformer parfaitement au mod\u00e8le matrimonial traditionnel afin de prouver que leur union est \u00ab conjugale \u00bb.\n60 Un couple de sexe diff\u00e9rent peut certainement, apr\u00e8s de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de vie commune, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme formant une union conjugale, m\u00eame sans enfants ni relations sexuelles. \u00c9videmment, le poids \u00e0 accorder aux divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments ou facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer si un couple de sexe diff\u00e9rent forme une union conjugale variera grandement, presque \u00e0 l\u2019infini. Cela doit s\u2019appliquer aussi aux couples de m\u00eame sexe. Les tribunaux ont eu la sagesse d\u2019adopter une m\u00e9thode souple pour d\u00e9terminer si une union est conjugale. Il doit en \u00eatre ainsi parce que les rapports dans les couples varient beaucoup. (\u2026)\n(notre soulignement)\n[20] Tels que repris \u00e0 maintes reprises par cette Cour, notamment dans la d\u00e9cision du juge Favreau de cette Cour dans Perron c Canada, 2010 CCI 547, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments et circonstances g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9s par la jurisprudence au Canada afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir si un couple non mari\u00e9 sont des conjoints de fait incluent les facteurs suivants \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019affaire Molodowich :\nLogement\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s vivaient-ils sous le m\u00eame toit?\nb) Couchaient-ils dans le m\u00eame lit?\nc) Y avait-il quelqu'un d'autre qui habitait chez eux?\nComportement sexuel et personnel\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s avaient-ils des rapports sexuels? Sinon, pourquoi?\nb) \u00c9taient-ils fid\u00e8les l'un \u00e0 l'autre?\nc) Quels \u00e9taient leurs sentiments l'un pour l'autre?\nd) Existait-il une bonne communication entre eux sur le plan personnel?\ne) Prenaient-ils leurs repas ensemble?\nf) Que faisaient-ils pour s'entraider face aux probl\u00e8mes ou \u00e0 la maladie?\ng) S'offraient-ils des cadeaux \u00e0 des occasions sp\u00e9ciales?\nServices\nComment les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s agissaient-ils habituellement en ce qui concerne:\na) la pr\u00e9paration des repas;\nb) le lavage et le raccommodage des v\u00eatements;\nc) les courses;\nd) l'entretien du foyer;\ne) les autres services m\u00e9nagers?\nRelations sociales\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s participaient-ils ensemble ou s\u00e9par\u00e9ment aux activit\u00e9s du quartier et de la collectivit\u00e9?\nb) Quelle \u00e9tait la nature des rapports de chacun d'eux avec les membres de la famille de l'autre et comment agissaient-ils envers ces derniers, et inversement, quel \u00e9tait le comportement de ces familles envers les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s?\nAttitude de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nQuelle attitude et quel comportement la collectivit\u00e9 avait-elle envers les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s individuellement et en tant que couple?\nSoutien \u00e9conomique\na) Quelles dispositions financi\u00e8res les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s prenaient-ils pour ce qui \u00e9tait de fournir les choses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie (vivres, v\u00eatements, logement, r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, etc.) ou de contribuer \u00e0 les fournir?\nb) Quelles dispositions prenaient-ils relativement \u00e0 l'acquisition et \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de biens?\nc) Existait-il entre eux des arrangements financiers particuliers que tous deux tenaient pour d\u00e9terminants quant \u00e0 la nature de leurs relations globales?\nEnfants\nQuelle attitude et quel comportement les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s avaient-ils \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des enfants?\n[21] Si on applique ces facteurs aux faits particuliers propres \u00e0 l'appelante, on peut tirer les conclusions suivantes :\nLogement\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s vivaient-ils sous le m\u00eame toit?\nb) Couchaient-ils dans le m\u00eame lit?\nc) Y avait-il quelqu'un d'autre qui habitait chez eux?\n[22] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que l'appelante et monsieur Cournoyer vivaient sous le m\u00eame toit avec leur fils Jacob au cours des p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige. L'appelante et monsieur Cournoyer ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que chacun avait sa propre chambre o\u00f9 se trouvait leur propre lit et effets personnels incluant un t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur dans le cas de monsieur Cournoyer. Ils ne partageaient jamais le m\u00eame lit. Pendant les p\u00e9riodes en litige, l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer occupaient chacun une chambre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage de la r\u00e9sidence rue Durocher, Gatineau. Jacob occupait la chambre au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e.\n[23] Selon la jurisprudence, il est admis que le simple fait de vivre sous le m\u00eame toit ne suffit pas pour conclure que deux personnes soient conjoints de fait. Dans l'affaire Kelner c Canada, [1995] ACI no 1130, le juge Bowman (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) a d'ailleurs tenu les propos suivants \u00e0 ce sujet :\n16 Je me fonderai au d\u00e9part sur la pr\u00e9misse selon laquelle il est possible, en droit, que les conjoints vivent s\u00e9par\u00e9s m\u00eame s'ils vivent sous un m\u00eame toit.\n[24] Le juge Rip (alors juge en chef adjoint) a formul\u00e9 le commentaire suivant dans l'affaire Aukstinaitis, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 :\n23 Le fait que l'appelante ait habit\u00e9 avec monsieur Mongeon sous le m\u00eame toit n'est pas fatal \u00e0 la cause de cette derni\u00e8re. Ce n'est d'ailleurs qu'un des facteurs \u00e0 tenir en ligne de compte.\n[25] Ce crit\u00e8re n\u2019est donc pas d\u00e9terminant dans les circonstances.\nComportement sexuel et personnel\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s avaient-ils des rapports sexuels? Sinon, pourquoi?\nb) \u00c9taient-ils fid\u00e8les l'un \u00e0 l'autre?\nc) Quels \u00e9taient leurs sentiments l'un pour l'autre?\nd) Existait-il une bonne communication entre eux sur le plan personnel?\ne) Prenaient-ils leurs repas ensemble?\nf) Que faisaient-ils pour s'entraider face aux probl\u00e8mes ou \u00e0 la maladie?\ng) S'offraient-ils des cadeaux \u00e0 des occasions sp\u00e9ciales?\n[26] L'appelante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle n'avait eu aucun rapport sexuel avec monsieur Cournoyer depuis son d\u00e9part pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 en 2005. La compr\u00e9hension de la Cour est que l\u2019absence de relation conjugale \u00e0 compter de ce moment explique l\u2019absence de tels rapports. D\u2019ailleurs durant la p\u00e9riode 2005-2008 les visites de monsieur Cournoyer rue Durocher, Gatineau sont espac\u00e9es et ne sont constitu\u00e9es que des visites \u00e0 Jacob. L\u2019appelante ne rend pas visite \u00e0 monsieur Cournoyer rue Joffre, Gatineau.\n[27] Depuis 2008, elle a d\u00e9crit leurs relations comme \u00e9tant une relation entre personnes civilis\u00e9es et souvent limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel. Le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du p\u00e8re de monsieur Cournoyer a men\u00e9 aux discussions entre les deux parties au sujet de louer une chambre. L\u2019appelante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 lou\u00e9 une chambre dans le pass\u00e9 et \u00e9tait donc \u00e0 m\u00eame d\u2019appr\u00e9cier les cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019une telle situation entra\u00eenait. La Cour retient du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante une femme dont la vie sociale au cours des p\u00e9riodes pertinentes est restreinte \u00e0 peu d\u2019activit\u00e9s et dont le cercle d\u2019amis semble absent. Donnant \u00e0 la Cour le sentiment d\u2019une personnalit\u00e9 davantage introvertie et r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, la Cour croit dans le cas pr\u00e9sent que l\u2019appelante est en mesure de prendre la d\u00e9cision de louer 3 ans apr\u00e8s la fin de la vie conjugale pour des raisons purement \u00e9conomiques et d\u2019entraide occasionnelle et le bien de son fils, sans par ailleurs associer le geste \u00e0 une situation entre conjoints de fait aux fins de la LIR.\n[28] La Cour retient des t\u00e9moignages de l\u2019appelante et de monsieur Cournoyer qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes durant les p\u00e9riodes en litige et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence ils sont rest\u00e9s fid\u00e8les. Toutefois, la Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019existence d\u2019une relation conjugale ou de couple impliquant l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019est pas responsable de cette fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, et que c\u2019est plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat de d\u00e9cisions personnelles prises de part et d\u2019autre, et sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019autre, qui explique l\u2019absence ou le peu de fr\u00e9quentations que chacun a choisi d\u2019adopter.\n[29] La Cour ne retient pas de la preuve que l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer avaient durant les p\u00e9riodes en litige des sentiments l\u2019un pour l\u2019autre pouvant s\u2019assimiler \u00e0 des sentiments pr\u00e9sents entre conjoints de fait ou mari\u00e9s. Les situations de confidences, d\u2019\u00e9changes, d\u2019interactions et de complicit\u00e9s qui normalement seraient \u00e0 un niveau ou un autre pr\u00e9sentes dans une relation conjugale apparaissent \u00e0 la Cour quasi inexistantes dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a compar\u00e9 la relation conjugale de l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer \u00e0 celle d\u2019un vieux couple. Une relation conjugale peut certes \u00e9volu\u00e9e, chang\u00e9e, vari\u00e9e et prendre une forme diff\u00e9rente au cours d\u2019une vie conjugale. Toutefois, la Cour ne retient pas une telle situation dans le cas pr\u00e9sent en ce qui concerne les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en litige.\n[30] Ils prenaient rarement un repas ensemble. Monsieur Cournoyer faisait son propre repas auquel Jacob pouvait se joindre compte tenu de l\u2019horaire plus r\u00e9gulier de monsieur. Monsieur Cournoyer lavait sa propre vaisselle. L\u2019appelante pouvait par la suite pr\u00e9parer son repas et laver sa vaisselle.\n[31] Durant les p\u00e9riodes et les ann\u00e9es en litige, l\u2019appelante pouvait occasionnellement permettre \u00e0 monsieur Cournoyer d\u2019utiliser sa voiture qui n\u2019en avait pas. La preuve entendue laisse croire \u00e0 la Cour \u00e0 peu d\u2019entraide entre l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer. Ces situations d\u2019entraide semblent d\u2019ailleurs principalement limit\u00e9es aux situations o\u00f9 l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019accompagner Jacob \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s scolaires ou parascolaires. La Cour consid\u00e8re cette entraide minimaliste dans les circonstances.\n[32] Selon l\u2019appelante, monsieur Cournoyer ne lui a jamais organis\u00e9 de f\u00eate et ne lui a jamais offert de cadeaux.\n[33] Pour reprendre les propos du juge Rip dans l\u2019affaire Aukstinaitis, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, il semble que les contacts et \u00e9changes entre l'appelante et monsieur Cournoyer \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t minimes et limit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce que l'on peut s'attendre de quiconque doit vivre et partager certains espaces avec une autre personne et essayer d'y vivre de fa\u00e7on civilis\u00e9e. L\u2019entraide entre l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer appara\u00eet minimaliste dans les circonstances.\n[34] La Cour est d\u2019avis que la preuve ne permet pas de conclure que ce deuxi\u00e8me facteur porte atteinte \u00e0 la position de l'appelante.\nServices\nComment les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s agissaient-ils habituellement en ce qui concerne:\na) la pr\u00e9paration des repas;\nb) le lavage et le raccommodage des v\u00eatements;\nc) les courses;\nd) l'entretien du foyer;\ne) les autres services m\u00e9nagers?\n[35] Selon les t\u00e9moignages entendus, les adultes ne pr\u00e9paraient pas de repas ensemble. Monsieur Cournoyer se l\u00e8ve et se couche tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t. Le soir venu, il pr\u00e9parait et mangeait le premier avec Jacob qui pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait habituellement la nourriture pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par son p\u00e8re. L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9parait son repas bien qu\u2019il pouvait arriver \u00e0 l\u2019occasion qu\u2019elle partage le repas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par monsieur Cournoyer. L\u2019appelante a reconnu avoir mang\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occasion en m\u00eame temps que lui bien que monsieur Cournoyer avait son propre horaire qui pouvait davantage accommoder Jacob. Cependant, aux dires m\u00eames de monsieur Cournoyer, ces occasions \u00e9taient rares. La vaisselle \u00e9tait l\u2019affaire de chacun.\n[36] L\u2019appelante ne s\u2019occupait pas de la lessive de monsieur Cournoyer. Il avait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la salle de lavage et faisait sa propre lessive. Elle ne s\u2019occupait pas non plus des v\u00eatements de monsieur Cournoyer. Monsieur Cournoyer avait \u00e9galement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la cuisine, sa chambre, salle de bain, et selon l\u2019appelante au salon, mais le moins possible. Madame s\u2019occupait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de l\u2019entretien m\u00e9nager de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 l\u2019exception notamment de la chambre de monsieur Cournoyer dont il s\u2019occupait lui-m\u00eame. Monsieur Cournoyer pouvait \u00eatre plus actif \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur lorsque les accumulations de neige \u00e9taient importantes.\n[37] Monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019ayant pas de voiture. Il est possible que quelques fois ils aient pu se rendre ensemble pour effectuer chacun leur course. Les circonstances ont pu aussi justifier qu\u2019ils partagent le co\u00fbt de certains items, vivant apr\u00e8s tout sous le m\u00eame toit. \u00c0 tout \u00e9v\u00e8nement, chacun faisait et payait sa propre \u00e9picerie. L\u2019appelante assumait alors le co\u00fbt de l\u2019essence de sa voiture tout comme toutes les autres d\u00e9penses de la r\u00e9sidence, exception de certains moments o\u00f9 monsieur Cournoyer pouvait payer l\u2019essence lorsqu\u2019il lui \u00e9tait permis d\u2019utiliser la voiture.\n[38] Monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019assumait pas le travail ni le co\u00fbt relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entretien et aux r\u00e9parations que pouvait requ\u00e9rir la r\u00e9sidence. Ces travaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas accomplis par monsieur Cournoyer qui ne s\u2019y int\u00e9ressait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas. L\u2019appelante contactait plut\u00f4t son fils a\u00een\u00e9 en ce qui concerne ces travaux et ces r\u00e9parations.\n[39] Dans l\u2019ensemble, ce facteur appara\u00eet favoriser l\u2019absence d\u2019une relation conjugale.\nRelations sociales\na) Les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s participaient-ils ensemble ou s\u00e9par\u00e9ment aux activit\u00e9s du quartier et de la collectivit\u00e9?\nb) Quelle \u00e9tait la nature des rapports de chacun d'eux avec les membres de la famille de l'autre et comment agissaient-ils envers ces derniers, et inversement, quel \u00e9tait le comportement de ces familles envers les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s?\n[40] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de l'appelante, elle ne faisait aucune activit\u00e9 sociale ext\u00e9rieure avec monsieur Cournoyer. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, aucun voyage n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9. Les deux t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audition n\u2019ont pas paru \u00eatre tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s aux activit\u00e9s du quartier et de la collectivit\u00e9. L\u2019appelante a paru \u00eatre une personne plut\u00f4t r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, peu port\u00e9e sur la vie du quartier et de sa collectivit\u00e9.\n[41] Lorsque les parties formaient un couple, l\u2019appelante admet qu\u2019ils pouvaient fr\u00e9quenter ensemble la famille de madame. Monsieur Cournoyer ne fr\u00e9quente pas sa famille. Par contre, certains liens ont pu \u00eatre maintenus avec la famille de l\u2019appelante suite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec de la relation conjugale. L\u2019appelante a relat\u00e9 l\u2019exemple de la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du no\u00ebl 2015 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence Durocher, Gatineau au moment o\u00f9 monsieur Cournoyer y louait une chambre. La m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante alors pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration avait invit\u00e9 monsieur Cournoyer \u00e0 se joindre \u00e0 eux alors que ce dernier n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas au d\u00e9part convi\u00e9. Monsieur Cournoyer avait maintenu de bons rapports avec la m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante, mais ne se sentait pas invit\u00e9 aux c\u00e9l\u00e9brations. Ce soir-l\u00e0, l\u2019appelante ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que monsieur Cournoyer se joigne \u00e0 eux. Monsieur Cournoyer a d\u2019ailleurs pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 son tour qu\u2019\u00e9tant une personne qui se couche t\u00f4t sa pr\u00e9sence lorsqu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e8nement s\u2019av\u00e9rait somme toute \u00e9court\u00e9e.\n[42] La Cour retient de ce facteur que monsieur Cournoyer avait conserv\u00e9 certains liens avec la famille de l\u2019appelante. Il semble aussi que la pr\u00e9sence lors ces rencontres de monsieur Cournoyer avec leur fils Jacob favorisait des relations plus cordiales. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas confirm\u00e9 avoir conserv\u00e9 des liens avec la famille de monsieur Cournoyer.\n[43] Ce facteur n\u2019appara\u00eet pas \u00e0 la Cour comme d\u00e9terminant dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. Certes monsieur Cournoyer a maintenu certains liens avec la famille de l\u2019appelante. Toutefois, ces liens n\u2019ont pas apparu \u00e0 la Cour impliquer l\u2019appelante, mais plut\u00f4t se produire en pr\u00e9sence de monsieur Cournoyer accompagn\u00e9 de son fils Jacob.\nAttitude de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nQuelle attitude et quel comportement la collectivit\u00e9 avait-elle envers les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s individuellement et en tant que couple?\n[44] L\u2019appelante a admis qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019occasion rare d\u2019une sortie en public les tiers pouvaient croire qu\u2019elle et monsieur Cournoyer formaient des conjoints de fait. Ce constat pouvait d\u2019autant plus \u00eatre invitant puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient alors accompagn\u00e9s de Jacob. La Cour retient du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante que ces sorties en public se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9es rares plus particuli\u00e8rement au cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es en litige. D\u00e8s que la question de conjoints de fait \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9e, l\u2019appelante affirme avoir toujours affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne formaient pas des conjoints de fait. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a jamais confirm\u00e9 se pr\u00e9senter comme conjoints de fait. Monsieur Cournoyer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 c\u00e9libataire incluant lors de la production des d\u00e9clarations de revenu. Elle n\u2019accompagnait pas non plus monsieur Cournoyer dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s sociales ou encore pour visiter sa famille. Monsieur Cournoyer accompagn\u00e9 de son fils seulement sont les seules quelques occasions qui lui ont permis de se retrouver avec des membres de la famille de l\u2019appelante.\n[45] En somme, ce facteur n\u2019appara\u00eet pas suffisamment d\u00e9terminant dans le cas pr\u00e9sent pour \u00e9tablir des conjoints de fait. Les activit\u00e9s ou occasions de s\u2019afficher comme conjoints de fait sont somme toute isol\u00e9es et totalement absentes dans le cas de la visite des familles respectives.\nSoutien (\u00e9conomique)\nSoutien \u00e9conomique\na) Quelles dispositions financi\u00e8res les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s prenaient-ils pour ce qui \u00e9tait de fournir les choses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la vie (vivres, v\u00eatements, logement, r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, etc.) ou de contribuer \u00e0 les fournir?\nb) Quelles dispositions prenaient-ils relativement \u00e0 l'acquisition et \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de biens?\nc) Existait-il entre eux des arrangements financiers particuliers que tous deux tenaient pour d\u00e9terminants quant \u00e0 la nature de leurs relations globales?\n[46] Selon la preuve et sous r\u00e9serve de ce qui suit, les d\u00e9penses relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence et \u00e0 la voiture de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient assum\u00e9es enti\u00e8rement par l\u2019appelante. Durant les p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige, un arrangement \u00e9tait en place entre l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer en vertu duquel un loyer \u00e9tait vers\u00e9 par monsieur \u00e0 l\u2019appelante pour la location d\u2019une chambre et l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des pi\u00e8ces de la r\u00e9sidence Durocher, Gatineau. Bien que peu de d\u00e9tails ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors des t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont cette mensualit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et ce qu\u2019elle incluait, la Cour retient que le paiement habituellement mensuel effectu\u00e9 par monsieur Cournoyer \u00e9tait pour la location de sa chambre et les co\u00fbts de consommation de la r\u00e9sidence li\u00e9s \u00e0 son utilisation par lui. Chacun encourait ses propres d\u00e9penses r\u00e9cr\u00e9atives, personnelles, et ses d\u00e9penses pour vivres et v\u00eatements. L\u2019appelante s\u2019occupait aussi des d\u00e9penses de Jacob. Il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre entente entre les parties.\n[47] Il est \u00e0 noter que monsieur Cournoyer aurait connu au cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es en litige un intervalle sans emploi. Les t\u00e9moignages ne sont pas clairs sur cet \u00e9v\u00e8nement ni sur la dur\u00e9e pertinente de cette p\u00e9riode au cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es en litige. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019aurait pas vers\u00e9 sa mensualit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. L\u2019appelante a mis en doute la dur\u00e9e de cet intervalle au cours de laquelle elle n\u2019aurait pas re\u00e7u de compensation. Aussi, elle maintient qu\u2019une compensation a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par monsieur Cournoyer lorsque sa situation \u00e9conomique s\u2019est par la suite corrig\u00e9e. Au surplus, monsieur Cournoyer a fait allusion lors de son t\u00e9moignage au fait que lorsque cette p\u00e9riode incertaine s\u2019\u00e9tait termin\u00e9e il a vers\u00e9 un montant plus important \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. La raison de ce montant suppl\u00e9mentaire est vague entre les parties. Par contre, le moment du d\u00e9but de cette compensation additionnelle vers\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelante correspond clairement \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi le retour sur le march\u00e9 du travail de monsieur Cournoyer. La Cour consid\u00e8re que la dur\u00e9e de cet intervalle aux fins la p\u00e9riode pertinente aurait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 une ann\u00e9e. La Cour retient donc que la preuve d\u00e9montre que l\u2019appelante a soutenu financi\u00e8rement monsieur Cournoyer durant au moins une partie de cet intervalle incluse dans la p\u00e9riode en litige, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une certaine compensation financi\u00e8re vers\u00e9e par la suite.\n[48] Le juge Rip dans l\u2019affaire Aukstinaitis pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e avait rencontr\u00e9 une situation quelque peu similaire quant \u00e0 un arrangement mon\u00e9taire :\nIl n\u2019est pas clair combien monsieur Mongeon contribuait financi\u00e8rement pour cette cohabitation, mais il semble qu\u2019il payait au moins pour l\u2019exc\u00e9dent des co\u00fbts que sa pr\u00e9sence occasionnait. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, il est vrai qu\u2019un tel arrangement puisse para\u00eetre \u00ab abusif \u00bb pour des gens n\u2019habitant pas en union de fait. N\u00e9anmoins, il faut consid\u00e9rer que monsieur Mongeon est all\u00e9 habiter chez l\u2019appelante apr\u00e8s avoir fait faillite et que cette derni\u00e8re voulait qu\u2019il puisse partir le plus t\u00f4t possible de chez elle.\n[49] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la Cour retient les motifs qui ont incit\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 accepter cet arrangement avec monsieur Cournoyer bien qu\u2019\u00e0 certains moments elle a souhait\u00e9 son d\u00e9part. L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e au d\u00e9part par l\u2019aspect \u00e9conomique et les souhaits d\u2019envisager le d\u00e9part de monsieur Cournoyer sont devenus plus difficiles lorsque Jacob est inform\u00e9 par monsieur Cournoyer du souhait de l\u2019appelante. D\u2019ailleurs la Cour conserve un sentiment partag\u00e9 sur la v\u00e9ritable intention de l\u2019appelante d\u2019avoir tol\u00e9r\u00e9 cet arrangement locatif \u00e0 tout le moins durant les p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige. Monsieur Cournoyer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard semble cat\u00e9gorique sur ses intentions de poursuivre l\u2019arrangement locatif. Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 ce sujet pr\u00e9sente une position beaucoup plus nuanc\u00e9e en sugg\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9sir de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019arrangement financier avec monsieur Cournoyer, mais la chose compliqu\u00e9e par l\u2019implication de Jacob. La Cour retient davantage le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante qui aux yeux de la Cour ne corrobore pas la position de monsieur Cournoyer.\n[50] De plus, il est clair pour la Cour que la contribution financi\u00e8re de monsieur Cournoyer ne visait pas directement les d\u00e9penses de l\u2019appelante. Le partage des d\u00e9penses concernait les d\u00e9penses relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence et non les d\u00e9penses personnelles de l'appelante.\n[51] Dans les circonstances, la Cour croit que le facteur \u00e9conomique comporte dans le cas pr\u00e9sent des attributs mixtes.\n7. Enfants\nQuelle attitude et quel comportement les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s avaient-ils \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des enfants?\n[52] Dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, l\u2019appelante et monsieur Cournoyer sont les parents de Jacob. Le fils a\u00een\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante n\u2019habitait pas dans la r\u00e9sidence rue Durocher, Gatineau au cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es en litige et le t\u00e9moignage de monsieur Cournoyer n\u2019a \u00e9tabli aucun lien avec l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante. Certes, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de Jacob lors des t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais l\u2019emphase des propos a port\u00e9 sur la situation des deux adultes. Toutefois, le fait demeure que Jacob contribue au maintien d\u2019un lien entre ses parents.\nVII. Conclusion\n[53] Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les facteurs retenus par les tribunaux, soupes\u00e9 les arguments de chaque partie, la Cour estime que l'appelante a apport\u00e9 une preuve suffisamment convaincante, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'elle ne vivait plus dans une relation conjugale avec monsieur Cournoyer aux cours des p\u00e9riodes et des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition en litige. La preuve testimoniale s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 dans cette affaire.\n[54] Quelques facteurs militent en faveur du maintien de l'union de fait apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9paration survenue en 2005, mais la Cour est d\u2019avis que la majorit\u00e9 des facteurs au cours des p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition en litige tend vers la reconnaissance de la vie s\u00e9par\u00e9e du couple tout au long des p\u00e9riodes et ann\u00e9es en litige. L\u2019appr\u00e9ciation faite par la Cour de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve favorise la position support\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante qui somme toute se retrouve dans une situation unique.\n[55] Dans Molodowich, confirm\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat M c H, la cour pr\u00e9cise que la mesure dans laquelle il sera tenu compte de chacun des sept \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessus sera n\u00e9cessairement fonction des circonstances de chaque cas. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans M c H confirme entre autres que le poids \u00e0 accorder aux divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments ou facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer une union conjugale variera grandement, presque \u00e0 l\u2019infini.

Introduction\n[1] La question fondamentale dans les pr\u00e9sents appels consiste \u00e0 savoir si le revenu de Viviana Reser gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada pendant qu\u2019elle et son mari, Clarence Reser, \u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9s peut servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si chacun a droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement apr\u00e8s leur r\u00e9conciliation.\n[2] Les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus ensemble sur preuve commune pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moignage de M. et Mme Reser. J\u2019estime qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient des t\u00e9moins cr\u00e9dibles et fiables qui n\u2019ont pas contest\u00e9 les faits essentiels et pertinents dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, le v\u00e9ritable diff\u00e9rend entre les parties est d\u2019ordre juridique, \u00e0 savoir la juste interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions relatives au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[3] Contrairement \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de M. et Mme Reser dans leurs appels, le revenu de Mme Reser en tant que non-r\u00e9sidente \u00e9tait un renseignement n\u00e9cessaire selon les d\u00e9finitions et les calculs pertinents de l\u2019article 122.5 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est fond\u00e9e sur le revenu familial net d\u2019un contribuable au cours d\u2019ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition pr\u00e9cises, et il est \u00e9vident que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu que le revenu des non-r\u00e9sidents soit inclus dans ce calcul.\nII. Contexte \u2013 Changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil\n[4] M. et Mme Reser se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9 le 1er septembre 2003 ou vers cette date. Le coup de gr\u00e2ce de leur relation \u00e9tait que Mme Reser avait re\u00e7u une offre d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Elle souhaitait l\u2019accepter, tandis que M. Reser ne voulait pas partir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[5] Mme Reser a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 aux \u00c9mirats arabes unis, o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 plein temps pour enseigner l\u2019anglais comme langue seconde. Elle a pris sa retraite en juillet 2017 et est revenue au Canada le 27 juillet 2017 ou vers cette date pour \u00eatre pr\u00e8s de ses parents \u00e2g\u00e9s \u00e0 Victoria. Elle s\u2019est \u00e9galement r\u00e9concili\u00e9e avec M. Reser peu de temps apr\u00e8s.\n[6] Lors de la production de leurs d\u00e9clarations de revenus de 2017, M. et Mme Reser ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 leur \u00e9tat civil comme \u00ab mari\u00e9 \u00bb. En 2016, M. Reser avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son \u00e9tat civil comme \u00ab s\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[7] Le ministre du Revenu national a initialement conclu que M. Reser avait droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement du 1er juillet 2017 au 30 juin 2018 et que Mme Reser avait droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 juin 2019.\n[8] Le ministre a par la suite demand\u00e9 des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 M. et Mme Reser en raison de leur changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil. Le ministre a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Reser de divulguer les revenus que son \u00e9pouse avait gagn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2016 et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Reser de divulguer les revenus qu\u2019elle avait gagn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2017.\n[9] M. et Mme Reser ont refus\u00e9 de fournir ces renseignements au ministre pour le motif que, durant cette p\u00e9riode de 18 mois, 1) ils \u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9s et 2) Mme Reser \u00e9tait une non-r\u00e9sidente dont le revenu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas assujetti \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t canadien. Le ministre a conclu que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de M. et Mme Reser au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e sans ces renseignements et, le 3 ao\u00fbt 2018, il a \u00e9tabli de nouvelles d\u00e9terminations r\u00e9duisant \u00e0 z\u00e9ro les cr\u00e9dits d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9s.\n[10] M. et Mme Reser maintiennent leur double th\u00e8se dans leurs appels \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ces nouvelles d\u00e9terminations. Toutefois, cette th\u00e8se va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des dispositions pertinentes relatives au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[11] M. et Mme Reser ont naturellement eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019y retrouver dans l\u2019application de ces dispositions quelque peu complexes. Dans ses observations orales, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de quelle fa\u00e7on les diverses d\u00e9finitions et les divers calculs de l\u2019article 122.5 s\u2019appliquent dans les pr\u00e9sents appels. J\u2019ai inclus les principales dispositions \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, et je tenterai de les simplifier davantage comme suit.\n[12] Fondamentalement, le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est calcul\u00e9 en fonction du revenu familial net d\u2019une ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, m\u00eame si un contribuable n\u2019\u00e9tait ni mari\u00e9 ni r\u00e9sident au Canada durant cette p\u00e9riode.\nIII. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est fond\u00e9e sur le revenu familial\n[13] Le l\u00e9gislateur a instaur\u00e9 le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS afin d\u2019offrir un certain all\u00e8gement aux familles \u00e0 faible revenu pour la TPS qu\u2019elles paient. Par cons\u00e9quent, le droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est fond\u00e9 sur le revenu du contribuable.\n[14] Afin de g\u00e9rer la mise en \u0153uvre du cr\u00e9dit, l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e automatiquement en fonction des revenus d\u00e9clar\u00e9s dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e ou les deux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, parfois qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00ab ann\u00e9es de base \u00bb [1] . Le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est calcul\u00e9 en fonction de ce revenu ant\u00e9rieur, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces ann\u00e9es.\n[15] Le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est vers\u00e9 chaque trimestre, pour des p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9termin\u00e9es commen\u00e7ant en juillet, en octobre, en janvier et en avril [2] . Ainsi, une ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te de p\u00e9riodes de versement s\u2019\u00e9tend du 1er juillet d\u2019une ann\u00e9e au 30 juin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante.\n[16] Si un contribuable est mari\u00e9, son admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est fond\u00e9e sur son revenu familial net, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le revenu d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par le contribuable et son conjoint vis\u00e9 [3] .\n[17] Dans la d\u00e9cision McFadyen, notre Cour a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit l\u2019objet et la justification de la prise en compte de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil d\u2019un contribuable dans le calcul [4] :\nLe cr\u00e9dit est offert en fonction du revenu familial et en reconnaissance du fait qu\u2019une grande partie des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es pour les besoins fondamentaux le sont sur la base de l\u2019unit\u00e9 familiale et non sur une base individuelle. Pour cette raison, le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est accord\u00e9 en consid\u00e9ration du revenu de l\u2019unit\u00e9 familiale.\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, les contribuables sont tenus d\u2019aviser le ministre de tout changement \u00e0 leur \u00e9tat matrimonial, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.5(6.1)b) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[19] En prenant la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce en exemple, le ministre a utilis\u00e9 les renseignements de la d\u00e9claration de revenus de 2016 de M. Reser pour d\u00e9terminer initialement son admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement commen\u00e7ant le 1er juillet 2017 et prenant fin le 30 juin 2018. M. Reser a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son \u00e9tat civil comme \u00ab s\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00bb et un revenu de 18 103 $.\n[20] Le ministre a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de 2017 de M. et Mme Reser pour d\u00e9terminer initialement l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de Mme Reser au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement commen\u00e7ant le 1er juillet 2018 et prenant fin le 30 juin 2019. Mme Reser n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu depuis son retour en tant que r\u00e9sidente canadienne en juillet 2017, tandis que M. Reser a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir gagn\u00e9 18 850 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te.\n[21] Les calculs sont effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 122.5 en supposant que la situation d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition donn\u00e9e restera la m\u00eame au cours des deux ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition suivantes [5] . Toutefois, s\u2019il y a un changement de situation, un contribuable pourrait ne plus \u00eatre admissible aux sommes d\u00e9j\u00e0 vers\u00e9es. C\u2019est ce que le ministre a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, apr\u00e8s que M. Reser a chang\u00e9 son \u00e9tat civil de \u00ab s\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 \u00ab mari\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[22] L\u2019\u00e9tat civil de M. Reser a chang\u00e9 le 27 juillet 2017. Par cons\u00e9quent, le ministre devait d\u00e9terminer de nouveau le droit de M. Reser au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS.\n[23] En application des d\u00e9finitions et des calculs pertinents de l\u2019article 122.5, les renseignements requis comprenaient \u00e0 la fois le revenu de M. et de Mme Reser en 2016, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9s au cours de cette ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition.\n[24] Un d\u00e9calage semblable s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019appel de Frenna que notre Cour a tranch\u00e9 [6] . M. Frenna s\u2019est mari\u00e9 en juin 2009. Son droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement du 1er juillet 2009 au 30 juin 2010 avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en fonction de son revenu de 2008 comme c\u00e9libataire. Notre Cour a conclu que son admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS devait \u00eatre recalcul\u00e9e pour inclure le revenu de son \u00e9pouse pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008, m\u00eame s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas mari\u00e9s \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 [7] .\n[25] Le changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil de M. Reser le 27 juillet 2017 a eu une incidence semblable sur le calcul de son droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS. Cependant, contrairement \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur les calculs pour toutes les p\u00e9riodes de versement en cause.\nIV. Le changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil doit avoir eu lieu \u00ab au d\u00e9but \u00bb de chacune des quatre p\u00e9riodes de paiement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es\n[26] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS est vers\u00e9 chaque trimestre, pour des p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9termin\u00e9es commen\u00e7ant en juillet, en octobre, en janvier et en avril. Compte tenu de la date de r\u00e9conciliation, le changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil de M. Reser ne s\u2019est pas produit au d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e commen\u00e7ant le 1er juillet 2017. Cela n\u2019a d\u2019incidence que sur le d\u00e9but de la prochaine p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, soit le 1er octobre.\n[27] La d\u00e9finition de \u00ab proche admissible \u00bb au paragraphe 122.5(1) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux \u00ab au d\u00e9but \u00bb d\u2019un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9, et non \u00ab au cours \u00bb d\u2019un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 :\nproche admissible Est un proche admissible d\u2019un particulier par rapport \u00e0 un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition la personne qui, au d\u00e9but de ce mois, est l\u2019\u00e9poux ou le conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 du particulier. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[28] L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 particulier est fond\u00e9e sur des situations familiales survenues avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode mensuelle d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente [8] .\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, le changement d\u2019\u00e9tat civil de M. et Mme Reser \u00e0 la fin du mois de juillet 2017 n\u2019a eu d\u2019incidence que sur le mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 commen\u00e7ant le 1er octobre 2017. Le revenu de Mme Reser pour 2016 devait donc \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul du droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS de M. Reser pour les trois p\u00e9riodes de versement commen\u00e7ant le 1er octobre 2017 et prenant fin le 30 juin 2018.\n[30] Cependant, le cas qui nous occupe est compliqu\u00e9 davantage par le fait que Mme Reser ne r\u00e9sidait pas au Canada en 2016.\nV. Un revenu de non-r\u00e9sident est requis pour le calcul du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS\n[31] Bien que M. et Mme Reser ne soient pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019application du paragraphe 122.5(6.2), cette disposition pr\u00e9sume que le revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser fait partie de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e aux fins du calcul de leurs droits respectifs au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS :\nNon-r\u00e9sidents et r\u00e9sidents pendant une partie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e seulement\n122.5(6.2) Pour l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent article, le revenu d\u2019une personne qui ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada \u00e0 un moment d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre le montant qui correspondrait \u00e0 son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e si elle r\u00e9sidait au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[32] La note explicative du minist\u00e8re des Finances pour la disposition d\u00e9crit l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur selon laquelle le revenu mondial d\u2019un contribuable doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans le calcul du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS [9] :\nLe nouveau paragraphe 122.5(6.2) de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que, lorsqu\u2019une personne ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada tout au long d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, le revenu de cette personne pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e aux fins du calcul du CTPS est, pour plus de pr\u00e9cisions, \u00e9gal au montant qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le revenu de la personne pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e si elle avait r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2016 doit \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS auquel son \u00e9poux a droit pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement commen\u00e7ant le 1er octobre 2017 et se terminant le 30 juin 2018.\n[34] De plus, le revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2017 doit \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS auquel elle a droit pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement commen\u00e7ant le 1er juillet 2018 et prenant fin le 30 juin 2019.\n[35] Pour \u00e9tayer leurs th\u00e8ses dans les appels, M. et Mme Reser ont tent\u00e9 de s\u2019appuyer sur les principes fiscaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux concernant la r\u00e9sidence, de m\u00eame que sur les montants de revenu d\u00e9termin\u00e9s dans des appels distincts concernant le suppl\u00e9ment de revenu garanti qu\u2019ils avaient pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de la Cour [10] . Cependant, ces principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux d\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cotisation et les montants calcul\u00e9s en application de lois distinctes ne sont pas pertinents pour les calculs requis du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS. Les dispositions relatives au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu \u00e9noncent clairement les montants requis pour calculer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable \u00e0 cette fin pr\u00e9cise.\nVI. Conclusion \u2013 De nouveaux calculs de cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS sont requis\n[36] Le ministre a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 z\u00e9ro les cr\u00e9dits pour la TPS de M. et Mme Reser pour le motif qu\u2019ils ont refus\u00e9 de fournir des renseignements concernant le revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser pour 2016 et 2017.\n[37] Cependant, lors du contre-interrogatoire, Mme Reser a estim\u00e9 que ses allocations de logement et son salaire aux \u00c9mirats arabes unis pour 2016 s\u2019\u00e9levaient \u00e0 90 000 $. Elle a estim\u00e9 le m\u00eame montant annuel pour 2017, mais l\u2019a actualis\u00e9 pour une partie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e avant son retour au Canada en juillet.\n[38] J\u2019accepte ces sommes, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019argument de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires et des pi\u00e8ces justificatives \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, j\u2019estime que Mme Reser \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et fiable. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas sond\u00e9 ni mis en doute l\u2019estimation fournie par Mme Reser. L\u2019avocate n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb poser la question si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter la r\u00e9ponse [11] .\n[39] Par cons\u00e9quent, le ministre ne peut plus affirmer qu\u2019il ne dispose pas de tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour calculer le revenu familial net de M. et Mme Reser pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017.\n[40] Je renvoie donc l\u2019affaire au ministre pour un nouvel examen et une nouvelle d\u00e9termination des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n(a) L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de M. Reser au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement du 1er octobre 2017 au 30 juin 2018, en tenant compte du revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser de 90 000 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2016\n(b) L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de Mme Reser au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS pour les p\u00e9riodes de versement du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 juin 2019, en tenant compte de son revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de 45 000 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2017 [12] .\n[41] Ce faisant, je ne pr\u00e9suppose pas que M. et Mme Reser ont droit au cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS [13] . Au contraire, cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur ma conclusion selon laquelle les montants du revenu de non-r\u00e9sidente de Mme Reser sont d\u00e9sormais connus et que des d\u00e9terminations finales peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies pour r\u00e9gler les questions en litige des pr\u00e9sents appels.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 13e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n\u00ab Joanna Hill \u00bb\nLa juge Hill\nAnnexe \u00ab A \u00bb\n122.5 (1) d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab revenu rajust\u00e9 \u00bb et de \u00ab proche admissible \u00bb :\nrevenu rajust\u00e9 En ce qui concerne un particulier pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition par rapport \u00e0 un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, le total de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e et du revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e de son proche admissible par rapport \u00e0 ce mois, calcul\u00e9s chacun comme si, dans le calcul de ce revenu, aucune somme :\na) n\u2019\u00e9tait incluse :\n(i) en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 56(1)q.1) ou du paragraphe 56(6),\n(ii) au titre d\u2019un gain provenant d\u2019une disposition de bien \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019applique l\u2019article 79,\n(iii) au titre d\u2019un gain vis\u00e9 au paragraphe 40(3.21);\n(b) n\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9ductible en application des alin\u00e9as 20(1)ww) ou 60y) ou z).\nproche admissible Est un proche admissible d\u2019un particulier par rapport \u00e0 un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition la personne qui, au d\u00e9but de ce mois, est l\u2019\u00e9poux ou le conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 du particulier.\nMontant r\u00e9put\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au titre de l\u2019imp\u00f4t\n122.5(3) Le particulier admissible par rapport \u00e0 un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir pay\u00e9 au cours de ce mois, au titre de son imp\u00f4t payable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e, un montant \u00e9gal au quart du montant obtenu par la formule suivante :\nA - B\no\u00f9 :\nA repr\u00e9sente la somme des montants suivants :\na) 213 $,\nb) 213 $ pour son proche admissible par rapport \u00e0 ce mois,\nc) 213 $, s\u2019il n\u2019a pas de proche admissible par rapport \u00e0 ce mois, mais peut d\u00e9duire un montant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en application du paragraphe 118(1), par l\u2019effet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(1)b), pour une de ses personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles par rapport \u00e0 ce mois,\nd) le produit de la multiplication de 112 $ par le nombre de ses personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles par rapport \u00e0 ce mois, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion d\u2019une telle personne pour laquelle un montant est inclus par application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) dans le calcul du total pour le mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9,\ne) si, par rapport \u00e0 ce mois, il n\u2019a pas de proche admissible, mais a une ou plusieurs personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles, 112 $,\nf) si, par rapport \u00e0 ce mois, il n\u2019a ni proche admissible ni personne \u00e0 charge admissible, 112 $ ou, s\u2019il est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9, le montant repr\u00e9sentant 2 % de l\u2019exc\u00e9dent \u00e9ventuel de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e sur 6 911 $;\nB 5 % de l\u2019exc\u00e9dent \u00e9ventuel de son revenu rajust\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 ce mois sur 27 749 $.\nMois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s\n122.5(4) Pour l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent article, les mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition sont juillet et octobre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition suivante et janvier et avril de la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition suivante.\nAvis au ministre\n122.5(6.1) Un particulier est tenu d\u2019aviser le ministre des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ci-apr\u00e8s avant la fin du mois suivant celui o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement se produit :\na) le particulier cesse d\u2019\u00eatre un particulier admissible;\nb) une personne devient le proche admissible du particulier ou cesse de l\u2019\u00eatre;\nc) une personne cesse d\u2019\u00eatre une personne \u00e0 charge admissible du particulier pour une autre raison que celle d\u2019avoir atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 19 ans.\nNon-r\u00e9sidents et r\u00e9sidents pendant une partie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e seulement\n122.5(6.2) Pour l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent article, le revenu d\u2019une personne qui ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada \u00e0 un moment d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre le montant qui correspondrait \u00e0 son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e si elle r\u00e9sidait au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 22\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2019-3850(IT)I et 2019-3821(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nVIVIANA RESER ET CLARENCE RESER c.

Suite \u00e0 ces interrogatoires pr\u00e9alables, sur consentement de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel le 8 avril 2022.\n[5] En avril 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a consenti \u00e0 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant en sp\u00e9cifiant qu\u2019il se r\u00e9servait le droit de la contester au besoin puisqu\u2019il n\u2019en avait pas pris connaissance. La Cour a rendu une ordonnance autorisant la prorogation du d\u00e9lai et l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e le 6 mai 2022 (voir Annexe 1, R\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e).\n[6] Plusieurs des nouveaux paragraphes inclus dans cette r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e font l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation.\n[7] D\u2019embl\u00e9e, il me parait important de pr\u00e9ciser que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que le but de sa requ\u00eate en radiation n\u2019est pas d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019appelant de faire de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, mais plut\u00f4t, il estime que le v\u00e9hicule choisi, soit la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, n\u2019est pas le v\u00e9hicule appropri\u00e9. Il soutient qu\u2019il aurait fallu que l\u2019appelant modifie son avis d\u2019appel, ce qui aurait permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\nII. R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et principes juridiques applicables en mati\u00e8re de radiation\n[8] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fonde sa requ\u00eate en radiation sur les articles 50, 51 et 53 des R\u00e8gles.\nL\u2019article 50 des R\u00e8gles\n[9] Le paragraphe 50(1) des R\u00e8gles expose les exigences \u00e0 satisfaire en mati\u00e8re d\u2019une r\u00e9plique, en particulier, relativement aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. L\u2019article 50 des R\u00e8gles se lit comme suit :\n50 (1) La r\u00e9plique indique :\na) les faits nouveaux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et qui sont admis;\nb) les faits nouveaux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et qui sont ni\u00e9s;\nc) les faits nouveaux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, que l\u2019appelant ne conna\u00eet pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019admet pas;\nd) tous les faits pertinents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel;\ne) toutes autres dispositions l\u00e9gislatives invoqu\u00e9es;\nf) tous autres moyens sur lesquels l\u2019appelant entend se fonder.\n(2) L\u2019appelant qui ne d\u00e9pose pas une r\u00e9plique est r\u00e9put\u00e9 nier les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n[10] Pour mettre cette disposition en contexte, il faut tenir compte des articles 48 et 49 des R\u00e8gles qui portent sur les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Il convient de rappeler que l\u2019article 48 et la formule 21(1)a) applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pr\u00e9voient que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel doit \u00e9num\u00e9rer les faits pertinents, pr\u00e9ciser les points en litige, mentionner les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives sur lesquelles l\u2019appel est fond\u00e9, \u00e9noncer les moyens sur lesquels l\u2019appelant entend se fonder et indiquer les conclusions recherch\u00e9es.\n[11] L\u2019article 49 des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit que la r\u00e9ponse indique les faits admis, les faits ni\u00e9s et les faits que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conna\u00eet pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019admet pas. Je fais miens les propos du Juge Sommerfeldt qui, dans l\u2019affaire Husky Oil Operations Limited c R, 2019 CCI 136 au para 8, a affirm\u00e9 que bien que l\u2019article 49 des R\u00e8gles n\u2019indique pas express\u00e9ment la source des faits qui sont admis, ni\u00e9s ou mis en cause, il ressort clairement du contexte qu\u2019il s\u2019agit des faits expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. En r\u00e9digeant sa r\u00e9ponse et en pr\u00e9cisant quels faits sont admis, ni\u00e9s ou mis en cause, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit donc se limiter aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Bien s\u00fbr, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique aussi les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait sur lesquels la ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation et tout autre fait pertinent. En outre, tout comme l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, la r\u00e9ponse indique les points en litige, les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives invoqu\u00e9es, les moyens sur lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9 entend se fonder et les conclusions recherch\u00e9es.\n[12] Or, le texte de l\u2019article 50 des R\u00e8gles reproduit plus haut limite ce que peut contenir la r\u00e9plique d\u2019abord en ce qui concerne les faits. Il convient de rappeler qu\u2019en vertu du paragraphe 50(2), l\u2019appelant qui ne d\u00e9pose pas de r\u00e9plique est r\u00e9put\u00e9 nier les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse. En revanche, celui qui choisit d\u2019en d\u00e9poser une indique les faits nouveaux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel qui sont admis, les faits nouveaux qui sont ni\u00e9s et les faits nouveaux que l\u2019appelant ne conna\u00eet pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019admet pas. L\u2019appelant indique aussi dans sa r\u00e9plique tous les faits pertinents relativement aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. L\u2019appelant ne peut donc pas, dans sa r\u00e9plique, \u00e9num\u00e9rer de nouveaux faits qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et qui n\u2019ont pas de lien avec les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse.\n[13] En ce qui concerne les questions en litige, celles-ci doivent \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 des R\u00e8gles et l\u2019article 50 ne pr\u00e9voit pas que la r\u00e9plique puisse servir \u00e0 indiquer de nouveaux points en litige.\nL\u2019article 51 des R\u00e8gles\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fonde \u00e9galement sa requ\u00eate sur l\u2019article 51 qui pr\u00e9voit les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 tous les actes de proc\u00e9dure. Le paragraphe 51(3) se lit comme suit :\n51(3) Une partie ne peut faire valoir une all\u00e9gation qui est incompatible avec une all\u00e9gation faite dans un acte de proc\u00e9dure ant\u00e9rieur ou qui soul\u00e8ve un nouveau motif que par voie de modification de l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure ant\u00e9rieur.\n[15] Il ne faut pas confondre la restriction selon laquelle une partie ne peut pas soulever un nouveau motif (\u00ab a new ground of claim \u00bb dans la version anglaise) au paragraphe 51(3) avec l\u2019autorisation \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(1)f) d\u2019indiquer tous autres moyens sur lesquels l\u2019appelant entend se fonder (\u00ab any other reasons the appellant intends to rely on \u00bb dans la version anglaise).\n[16] L\u2019appelant ne peut pas avoir recours \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique pour soulever un nouveau motif, mais doit plut\u00f4t proc\u00e9der par voie de modification de son avis d\u2019appel pour ce faire. Ce point de vue est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par l\u2019extrait suivant des motifs expos\u00e9s par la juge Lamarre-Proulx dans l\u2019affaire Modlivco Inc c Canada, 95 DTC 692 aux para 22-24, affaire dans laquelle l\u2019appelante tentait de soulever un nouveau motif (voir le para 6 et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab ground of appeal \u00bb) :\n[Traduction]\n22 L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) et a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019article 50 portant sur les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit au paragraphe 2 :\n(2) L\u2019appelant qui ne d\u00e9pose pas une r\u00e9plique est r\u00e9put\u00e9 nier les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n23 Il soutient donc que rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eache de pr\u00e9senter une argumentation quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention d\u2019une telle argumentation dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Si la Cour tranche cette question \u00e0 son pr\u00e9judice, il demandera la permission de modifier l\u2019avis d\u2019appel afin d\u2019y inclure l\u2019argumentation.\n24 Selon les R\u00e8gles, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel doit pr\u00e9ciser les points en litige et \u00e9noncer les moyens sur lesquels l\u2019appelante entend se fonder. Si l\u2019appelante souhaite soulever des points en litiges autres que la diligence relativement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re cotisation, elle doit le faire par le truchement de son avis d\u2019appel et non en invoquant le paragraphe 50(2) des R\u00e8gles.\nAyant conclu que l\u2019appelante tentait de soulever un nouveau point en litige (voir Modlivco au para 6, \u00ab ground of appeal \u00bb), la juge Lamarre-Proulx a conclu qu\u2019elle devait le faire en modifiant son avis d\u2019appel et non par l\u2019application de l\u2019article 50 des R\u00e8gles applicable \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique.\nL\u2019article 53 des R\u00e8gles\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque \u00e9galement l\u2019article 53 des R\u00e8gles et s\u2019appuie plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(1)a) qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n53 (1) La Cour peut, de son propre chef ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, radier un acte de proc\u00e9dure ou tout autre document ou en supprimer des passages, en tout ou en partie, avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier parce que l\u2019acte ou le document :\na) peut compromettre ou retarder l\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable de l\u2019appel;\n[18] Les principes jurisprudentiels applicables dans une requ\u00eate en radiation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 53 des R\u00e8gles sont bien \u00e9tablis et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris dans de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour et de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il est de jurisprudence constante que le crit\u00e8re applicable aux requ\u00eates en radiation consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est \u00ab \u00e9vident et manifeste \u00bb que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent aucune cause raisonnable d\u2019action ou que la position prise n\u2019a aucune chance de succ\u00e8s et le seuil pour y satisfaire est \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[19] Le juge en chef Bowman (tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait alors) fait un sommaire succinct des principes jurisprudentiels pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans l\u2019affaire Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corporation, Strother c R, 2007 CCI 742, cit\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position relativement \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. Le juge Bowman s\u2019exprime comme suit :\n[4] J\u2019\u00e9noncerai en premier lieu les principes qui, selon moi, doivent s\u2019appliquer dans une requ\u00eate en radiation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 53 des R\u00e8gles. La question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e dans de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions de la Cour et de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.

En outre, l\u2019article 51 emp\u00eache une partie de faire valoir une all\u00e9gation qui est incompatible avec une all\u00e9gation faite dans un acte de proc\u00e9dure ant\u00e9rieur.\nBloc 1 d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[26] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que les all\u00e9gations aux paragraphes 1f), 1g), 12, 22, 23, 33, 60 et 61 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont incompatibles avec les all\u00e9gations figurant dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel aux paragraphes 2, 4, 26, 68 et 69 lesquels se lisent comme suit :\nAvis d\u2019appel\nExpos\u00e9 des faits\n2. L\u2019Appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sident du Canada jusqu\u2019au 30 septembre 2007;\n4. J. Cayouette a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidente du Canada jusqu\u2019au 30 septembre 2007;\n26. Le 30 septembre, l\u2019Appelant et J. Cayouette ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sidents du Canada pour les fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir leur r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Monaco, et ce, afin de satisfaire \u00e0 leur plan de retraite.\nDispositions l\u00e9gislatives et motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui du pr\u00e9sent appel\n68. Or, au moment o\u00f9 ce montant est effectivement payable \u00e0 J. Cayouette au sens des paragraphes 104(13) et 104(24) de la LIR, tant cette derni\u00e8re que l\u2019Appelant n\u2019\u00e9taient plus r\u00e9sidents du Canada;\n69. De plus, l\u2019Appelant soumet que l\u2019intim\u00e9e erre en statuant que JCS Trust a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sidente du Canada au m\u00eame moment que l\u2019Appelant et J. Cayouette, soit le 30 septembre 2007;\n[27] Or, dans ces paragraphes de son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant a fait des all\u00e9gations concernant la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de J. Cayouette. Je note que dans sa r\u00e9ponse et sa r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel aux paragraphes 2.1 et 2.9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant aux paragraphes 2, 4 et 26 de son avis d\u2019appel.\n[28] Les paragraphes 1f), 1g), 12, 22, 23, 33, 60 et 61 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e pr\u00e9voient ce qui suit :\n1. f) Le 30 septembre 2007, l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse ont quitt\u00e9 le Canada pour se rendre \u00e0 Cap d\u2019Ail, Fr. Dans les semaines qui suivirent, ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 Monaco puis ont fait une demande formelle aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s mon\u00e9gasques afin d\u2019obtenir leur r\u00e9sidence permanente;\n1. g) Ce n\u2019est que le 25 octobre 2007 que les autorit\u00e9s mon\u00e9gasques ont formellement accept\u00e9 que ceux-ci deviennent r\u00e9sidents de Monaco en leur \u00e9mettant leurs Cartes de r\u00e9sidence respectives.\nFinalement, il nie qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 au Canada et pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019appelant (tout comme son \u00e9pouse) a d\u00fbment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 et pay\u00e9 tous ses imp\u00f4ts pour la P\u00e9riode, incluant son l\u2019imp\u00f4t de d\u00e9part notamment sur les gains pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s totalisant environ 3.2 millions de dollars pour l\u2019appelant (et plus de $315,000 pour son \u00e9pouse). C\u2019est ainsi, et que l\u2019appelant (tout comme son \u00e9pouse) a d\u00fbment produit sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour la P\u00e9riode aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence du Revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb), le tout en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu (Canada) (\u00ab LIR \u00bb).\n12. Il prend note des d\u00e9n\u00e9gations contenues au paragraphe 2.16 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et lie contestation. Il ajoute par ailleurs qu\u2019aucun montant \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette, \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire deu JCS Trust, alors que JCS Trust \u00e9tait r\u00e9sidente du Canada. et que ladite b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e9tait non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada. Il pr\u00e9cise enfin, qu\u2019aucun montant n\u2019est \u00e9tait devenue payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust alors que tant la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire que et JCS Trust \u00e9taient toustes deux r\u00e9sidentes du Canada, puisque conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 104(24) LIR, aucun montant n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et elle n\u2019avait aucun droit, au cours de la P\u00e9riode, d\u2019en exiger le paiement.\n22. Il nie les all\u00e9gations contenues audu paragraphe 9.2 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse se sont \u00e9tablis rendus \u00e0 Monaco Cap d\u2019Ail, Fr. le 1er octobre 2007, afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir leur r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Monaco. Il ajoute que ceux-ci ne sont effectivement devenus r\u00e9sidents de Monaco que le 25 octobre 2007, suite \u00e0 la remise en mains propres par les autorit\u00e9s mon\u00e9gasques de leurs Cartes de r\u00e9sidence respectives. date \u00e0 laquelle ils sont devenus non-r\u00e9sidents du Canada.\n23. Il admet les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contenus aux paragraphes 9.3 \u00e0 9.7 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. appel, mais pr\u00e9cise que ce n\u2019est que le 25 octobre 2007 qu\u2019ils sont devenus r\u00e9sidents de Monaco.\n33. Quant au paragraphe 9.25 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant s\u2019en remet aux d\u00e9clarations de revenus telles qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites pour la P\u00e9riode par J. CayouetteJohanne Cayouette et lui-m\u00eame et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme. Par ailleurs, il pr\u00e9cise que bien que lui-m\u00eame et son \u00e9pouse ait quitt\u00e9 le Canada le 30 septembre 2007, ils se sont rendus \u00e0 Cap d\u2019Ail, Fr. le 1er octobre 2007 en vue de faire une demande de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Monaco aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s mon\u00e9gasques.\n60. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.51 (f) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que Johanne Cayouette et lui-m\u00eame sont devenus non-r\u00e9sidents du ont quitt\u00e9 le Canada le 30 septembre 2007, mais ne sont devenus r\u00e9sidents de Monaco que le 25 octobre 2007, lorsque leur furent remises leurs Cartes de r\u00e9sidence respectives. Il appartient \u00e0 cette cour de d\u00e9terminer la date \u00e0 laquelle lui et son \u00e9pouse sont devenus non-r\u00e9sidents du Canada. Au surplus, 1er octobre 2007. iIl nie que les faits qui y sont d\u00e9crits constituent une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations aux fins de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 245 de la LIR.\n61. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.51(g) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019effet que JCS Trust aurait \u00ab allou\u00e9 \u00bb un montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette le 1er octobre 2007. Il et pr\u00e9cise que JCS Trust a plut\u00f4t fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour son exercice se terminant le 1er octobre 2007 et que JCS Trust a \u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction du m\u00eame montant, \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit, en s\u2019appuyant sur le en accord avec le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. En effet, le montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ n\u2019a en aucun cas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab allou\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette le 1er octobre 2007, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend l\u2019intim\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date, aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait devenu payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le pouvoir de cotiser JCS Trust afin de lui refuser ladite d\u00e9duction et de l\u2019imposer sur le montant du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9, mais elle s\u2019en est abstenue. Quant au reste du paragraphe, l\u2019appelant s\u2019en remet \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenus, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par JCS Trust pour son exercice financier termin\u00e9 le 1er octobre 2007 et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme. Il ajoute qu\u2019en date du 1er octobre 2007, Johanne Cayouette \u00e9tait non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada et que la Partie I de la LIR ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 celle-ci. Il pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la Partie XIII de la LIR ne pouvait non plus s\u2019appliquer puisque le montant dudit \u00e9quivalent audit dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas, \u00e0 cette m\u00eame date, \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette. Finalement, il nie que les all\u00e9gations d\u00e9crites au du paragraphe 9.51(g) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel constituent une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations aux fins de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 245 de la LIR.\n[29] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a mis en exergue les mots ajout\u00e9s et ray\u00e9s dans les paragraphes 1f), 1g), 12, 22, 23, 33, 60 et 61 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e concernent la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de sa conjointe et a soutenu que les modifications soul\u00e8vent des questions relativement \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle ils ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sidents du Canada en rappelant que ces faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et admis dans la r\u00e9ponse (et dans la r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e) \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, on peut voir qu\u2019au paragraphe 22 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant a ray\u00e9 les mots \u00ab date \u00e0 laquelle ils sont devenus non-r\u00e9sidents du Canada \u00bb en lien avec la date du 1er octobre 2007. Le r\u00e9sultat de cette modification est de cr\u00e9er une incompatibilit\u00e9 entre le paragraphe 22 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e et les all\u00e9gations de fait contenues dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et admises dans la r\u00e9ponse en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de sa conjointe.\n[30] Dans ses observations \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a soutenu que la Cour devra d\u00e9terminer quand le montant est devenu payable par la fiducie JCS Trust \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, J. Cayouette. Les parties prennent des positions contraires quant \u00e0 la question de la r\u00e9sidence de la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au moment o\u00f9 le montant est devenu payable par la fiducie. Quant \u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9sidence soulev\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab techniquement, \u00e7a devrait m\u00eame pas \u00eatre bon pour nous \u00bb et a ajout\u00e9 \u00ab on ne met plus de date de non-r\u00e9sidence du Canada parce qu\u2019on s\u2019est aper\u00e7us que la d\u00e9termination d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence ou d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sident du Canada ou de ne pas \u00eatre r\u00e9sident du Canada c\u2019est une question mixte de fait et de droit. Puis c\u2019est une question qui appartient \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer \u00bb (Transcription de l\u2019audience \u00e0 la p 39). L\u2019appelant a soutenu que les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique en ce qui concerne les all\u00e9gations relativement \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de sa conjointe ne font que refl\u00e9ter ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit lors de l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable et il voulait inclure cela dans les plaidoiries (Transcription de l\u2019audience \u00e0 la p 42).\n[31] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de la Cour concernant la raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas plut\u00f4t opt\u00e9 pour une modification de son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9pondu comme suit : \u00ab parce qu\u2019on consid\u00e8re premi\u00e8rement que \u00e7a ne change rien si on le fait dans la r\u00e9plique \u00bb et que \u00ab les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019on a soulev\u00e9s ne changeaient rien au d\u00e9bat \u00bb (Transcription de l\u2019audience aux pp 42 et 46). Il a ajout\u00e9 que cela aurait aussi caus\u00e9 un retard indu.\n[32] Avec \u00e9gard, une fois que l\u2019appelant a fait des all\u00e9gations concernant la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019appelant et sa conjointe sont devenus des non-r\u00e9sidents et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis ces all\u00e9gations de fait, il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur cette question. Or, si l\u2019appelant veut modifier ses all\u00e9gations de fait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il doit le faire en modifiant son avis d\u2019appel sans quoi les all\u00e9gations dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont incompatibles avec les all\u00e9gations faites dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et admises dans la r\u00e9ponse et la r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. \u00c0 mon avis, cela est contraire au paragraphe 51(3) des R\u00e8gles. Pour ces raisons, les paragraphes 1f), 1g), 12, 22, 23, 33, 60 et 61 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont radi\u00e9s, sans autorisation de les modifier.\nBloc 2 d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[33] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que les all\u00e9gations aux paragraphes 37, 38, 39, 45, 50, 55, 61 (aussi dans le Bloc 1), 63, 64, 67, 71, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 et 83 \u00e0 90 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont incompatibles avec les all\u00e9gations figurant au paragraphe 34b) de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel lequel se lit comme suit :\n34. b) Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, JCS Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction au m\u00eame montant relativement aux revenus attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 J. Cayouette;\n[34] Les paragraphes 37, 38, 39, 45, 50, 55, 61, 63, 64, 67, 71, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 et 83 \u00e0 90 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9s :\n37. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, le paragraphe 9.28(b) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que JCS Trust a plut\u00f4t fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus, pour son exercice se terminant le 1er octobre 2007, et que JCS Trust a \u00e9galement erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction du m\u00eame montant en accord avec s\u2019appuyant sur le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. En effet, puisqu\u2019aucun montant \u00e9quivalent au montant du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire le 1er octobre 2007, JCS Trust n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. Quant au reste du paragraphe, l\u2019appelant s\u2019en remet \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenus telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par JCS Trust et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme.\n38. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, le paragraphe 9.28(c) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que JCS Trust n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 inscrire un montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t payable en vertu de la Partie XII.2 de la LIR dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour son exercice se terminant le 1er octobre 2007. Quant au reste du paragraphe, l\u2019appelant s\u2019en remet \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenus telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par JCS Trust et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme.\n39. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, le paragraphe 9.28(d) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que JCS Trust n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 inscrire un montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t payable en vertu de la Partie XIII de la LIR dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour son exercice se terminant le 1er octobre 2007, puisqu\u2019aucun montant n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust en date du 1er octobre 2007.

Il pr\u00e9cise que la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust a donn\u00e9 instruction \u00e0 la banque RBC Bahamas du JCS Trust de payer plut\u00f4t le montant de 12.5 millions de dollars, qui lui \u00e9tait devenu payable le 1er novembre 2007, \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, puisqu\u2019elle avait assum\u00e9 la dette de JCS Trust envers l\u2019appelant dudu m\u00eame montant.\n50. Il nie les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.45 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Il pr\u00e9cise que tout montant payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust n\u2019est aucunement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 lorsque le revenu est suppos\u00e9ment gagn\u00e9 par la fiducie, mais uniquement lorsque le fiduciaire, par l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, d\u00e9clare le quantum du montant qu\u2019il entend distribuer \u00e0 ladite b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou encore lorsque ledit montant est pay\u00e9. Il ajoute que les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.45 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel constituent une conclusion de faits et de droit et qu\u2019elles ne faisaient pas partie de la v\u00e9rification fiscale de l\u2019appelant effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a le fardeau de les prouver. prouver. Il ajoute \u00e9galement que puisque JCS Trust n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun revenu ou autre montant d\u00e9coulant des actions ordinaires de Margesca durant la P\u00e9riode et que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en date du 1er novembre 2007 que Margesca a vers\u00e9 un premier dividende de $12,719,335 \u00e0 JCS Trust, aucun montant n\u2019a pu \u00eatre payable ni pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette avant cette date, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lesquelles sont ni\u00e9es. Le 1er novembre 2007, Johanne Cayouette et JCS Trust \u00e9taient r\u00e9sidents de Monaco et des Bahamas, respectivement.\n55. Il admet les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contenus au paragraphe 9.50 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Il ajoute cependant que JCS Trust s\u2019est erron\u00e9ment pr\u00e9valu de la d\u00e9duction du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, puisqu\u2019aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait alors payable \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n61. Il nie, tel que libell\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.51(g) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019effet que JCS Trust aurait \u00ab allou\u00e9 \u00bb un montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette le 1er octobre 2007. Il et pr\u00e9cise que JCS Trust a plut\u00f4t fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour son exercice se terminant le 1er octobre 2007 et que JCS Trust a \u00e9galement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction du m\u00eame montant, \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit, en s\u2019appuyant sur le en accord avec le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. En effet, le montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ n\u2019a en aucun cas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab allou\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette le 1er octobre 2007, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend l\u2019intim\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date, aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait devenu payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le pouvoir de cotiser JCS Trust afin de lui refuser ladite d\u00e9duction et de l\u2019imposer sur le montant du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9, mais elle s\u2019en est abstenue. Quant au reste du paragraphe, l\u2019appelant s\u2019en remet \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenus, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par JCS Trust pour son exercice financier termin\u00e9 le 1er octobre 2007 et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme. Il ajoute qu\u2019en date du 1er octobre 2007, Johanne Cayouette \u00e9tait non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada et que la Partie I de la LIR ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 celle-ci. Il pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la Partie XIII de la LIR ne pouvait non plus s\u2019appliquer puisque le montant dudit \u00e9quivalent audit dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas, \u00e0 cette m\u00eame date, \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette. Finalement, il nie que les all\u00e9gations d\u00e9crites au du paragraphe 9.51(g) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel constituent une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations aux fins de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 245 de la LIR.\n63. Il nie les all\u00e9gations contenues aux des paragraphes 9.52 et 9.53 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il a d\u00fbment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 et pay\u00e9, pour la P\u00e9riode, tous ses imp\u00f4ts sur le revenu, y compris son imp\u00f4t de d\u00e9part notamment applicable \u00e0 ses gains pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin de ladite m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, le tout en accord avec la LIR. Il pr\u00e9cise de plus que puisque JCS Trust n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction r\u00e9clam\u00e9e selon le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9mettre une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de JCS Trust afin de lui refuser le montant de cette d\u00e9duction et de l\u2019imposer sur le dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9, mais elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 s\u2019en abstenir.\n64. Il nie les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.54 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Quant au paragraphe 9.54c), il pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019aucun montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Johanne Cayouette en date du 1er octobre 2007 et que la d\u00e9duction dudit dividende par JCS Trust a \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. En effet, aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait alors payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n67. Il nie dans son enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 le paragraphe 10.2 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise que celui-ci constitue uniquement des all\u00e9gations relatives aux politiques fiscales et des conclusions de droit que seule cette cour est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer. Quant au paragraphe 10.2c), il ajoute que la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par JCS Trust selon le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. En effet, puisqu\u2019aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait alors payable \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, JCS Trust n\u2019avait pas le droit \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9duction. l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra d\u00e9montrer devant cette cour.\n71. Quant au paragraphe 11.1 e) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, il pr\u00e9cise que le montant de 12.5 millions de dollars est devenu payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire le 1er novembre 2007.\n77. Il pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que bien que JCS Trust ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant le 1er octobre 2007, un revenu de dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 au montant de 12,919,334$ et r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction du m\u00eame montant \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit, en vertu du selon le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust et l\u2019appelant (par application des r\u00e8gles d\u2019attribution pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la LIR) n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 inclure ledit montant dans leurs revenus pour la P\u00e9riode en vertu de la Partie I de la LIR, puisqu\u2019aucune somme n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 cette m\u00eame date payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire aux termes de la LIR. ils \u00e9taient tous deux non-r\u00e9sidents du Canada au m\u00eame moment et la Partie I de la LIR ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 eux.\n78. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait grand \u00e9tat du fait que JCS Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR eu \u00e9gard au montant de dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par JCS Trust le 30 aout 2007. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le fait d\u2019avoir r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une telle d\u00e9duction \u00e9quivaut n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une distribution de ce m\u00eame montant \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, montant sur lequel cette derni\u00e8re aurait autrement d\u00fb s\u2019imposer en vertu du paragraphe 104(13) de la LIR. Toutefois, cette position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne tient pas compte du paragraphe 104(24) de la LIR, non plus que du libell\u00e9 des paragraphes 104(6) et 104(13) de la LIR.\n79. Le paragraphe 104(24) est clair et pr\u00e9cis. Aucune d\u00e9duction (par une fiducie) en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) et aucune inclusion (dans le revenu du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire) en vertu du paragraphe 104(13) n\u2019est respectivement permise et requise \u00e0 moins que le montant qui peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duit par une fiducie et qui devrait \u00eatre inclus dans le revenu du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00ab n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019ait eu le droit d\u2019en exiger le paiement \u00bb. Selon les faits, au moment o\u00f9 tout montant est devenu\npayable ou pay\u00e9 par JCS Trust \u00e0 sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, celle-ci (tout comme l\u2019appelant) ainsi que JCS Trust \u00e9taient r\u00e9sidents de Monaco et des Bahamas, respectivement.\n80. Le fait que JCS Trust ait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en d\u00e9duction le montant du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 alors que le paragraphe 104(6) ne l\u2019y autorisait pas, ne vient en rien conclure que sa b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire devait alors s\u2019imposer sur ledit montant en vertu du paragraphe 104(13) de la LIR. Tout au contraire, la LIR ne contient aucune disposition pr\u00e9sumant que lorsqu\u2019une fiducie se pr\u00e9vaut erron\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) que le montant d\u00e9duit doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. En d\u2019autres termes, le fait pour une fiducie de r\u00e9clamer erron\u00e9ment une d\u00e9duction en vertu du paragraphe 104(6), ne fait aucunement en sorte qu\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 cette d\u00e9duction est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n73.81. Bien que JCS Trust ait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction pour son ann\u00e9e fiscale se terminant le 1er octobre 2007 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0\n12,919,334 $, JCS Trust n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9duction selon le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, puisqu\u2019aucun montant n\u2019\u00e9tait alors payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le pouvoir de cotiser JCS Trust pour lui refuser cette d\u00e9duction et l\u2019imposer sur ledit montant, mais elle a choisi de ne pas cotiser JCS Trust \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019appelant r\u00e9it\u00e8re que l\u2019obligation de la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de JCS Trust de s\u2019imposer sur un montant de 12,919,334 $ en vertu du paragraphe 104(13) de la LIR est sujette aux termes de cette disposition (\u00e0 savoir que le montant \u00e9tait devenu payable) ainsi qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 104(24) (\u00e0 savoir qu\u2019un montant est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 ne pas \u00eatre devenu payable \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019ait pu en exiger le paiement). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du dividende de 12,719,335 $ pay\u00e9 au JCS Trust le 1er novembre 2007 par Margesca, seul un montant de 12.5 millions de dollars est devenu payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, le m\u00eame jour. En date du 1er novembre 2007, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ainsi que l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient r\u00e9sidents de Monaco et la Partie I de la LIR ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 eux.\n83. Quant \u00e0 la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la RGAE s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelant soutient que cette application est erron\u00e9e.\n84. En effet, la RGAE, en accord avec la jurisprudence, peut s\u2019appliquer lorsque les parties \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration ou une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations ont utilis\u00e9 les dispositions de la LIR en accord avec le libell\u00e9 de celles-ci.\n85. En d\u2019autres termes, la RGAE intervient pour red\u00e9finir les attributs fiscaux lorsque les dispositions de la LIR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es correctement mais qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte un avantage fiscal que l\u2019intention de ces dispositions ne visait pas.\n86. L\u2019appelant soutient, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que lui et JCS Trust n\u2019ont pris avantage d\u2019aucunes des dispositions de la LIR afin d\u2019en contourner l\u2019esprit, incluant notamment le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que JCS Trust n\u2019\u00e9tait tout simplement pas admissible \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue audit paragraphe. Puisqu\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalent au dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $ n\u2019\u00e9tait pas payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire en date du 1er octobre 2007, JCS Trust ne pouvait l\u00e9galement r\u00e9clamer la d\u00e9duction de ce m\u00eame montant dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus produite pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant le 1er octobre 2007.\n87. Le fait que JCS Trust ait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit ne rel\u00e8ve aucunement de la RGAE. En accord avec la jurisprudence, l\u2019article 245 de la LIR est une disposition de dernier ressort que l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut invoquer lorsque les autres dispositions de la LIR ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement utilis\u00e9es par un contribuable dans le cadre d\u2019op\u00e9rations ou de s\u00e9ries d\u2019op\u00e9rations, mais seulement lorsque l\u2019esprit de ces m\u00eames dispositions a \u00e9t\u00e9 frustr\u00e9 ou abus\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir un avantage fiscal.\n88. Le probl\u00e8me avec la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est que JCS Trust n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9ligible \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a choisi de ne pas cotiser JCS Trust afin de lui refuser cette d\u00e9duction et de l\u2019imposer sur le montant du dividende r\u00e9put\u00e9 de 12,919,334 $.\n89. Le seul avantage fiscal dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est que JCS Trust s\u2019est pr\u00e9valu d\u2019une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit.\n74.90. L\u2019appelant soutient, en cons\u00e9quence, que la RGAE ne peut clairement trouver application dans le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[35] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 le fait que plusieurs des paragraphes dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e et figurant au Bloc 2 contiennent une all\u00e9gation que JCS Trust a erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR (voir les paragraphes 37, 55, 64, 67, 80) ou a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 laquelle elle n\u2019avait pas droit (voir les paragraphes 61, 63, 77, 81, 86, 87, 88, 89). Dans d\u2019autres paragraphes (38, 39), l\u2019appelant a ray\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il s\u2019en \u00ab remet \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenu telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par JCS Trust et nie tout ce qui n\u2019y est pas conforme \u00bb ce qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, inclut un changement de position relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. Quant aux paragraphes 45, 50, 71 et 78, il s\u2019agit selon l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s qui touchent aussi \u00e0 la notion du moment o\u00f9 le montant est devenu payable par JCS Trust \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. La m\u00eame observation s\u2019applique au paragraphe 79. Le paragraphe 90 quant \u00e0 lui, comme r\u00e9dig\u00e9 avec la mention \u00ab en cons\u00e9quence \u00bb d\u00e9coule tout simplement des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et n\u2019a aucun sens si les autres paragraphes sont radi\u00e9s. Je note que certains des paragraphes regroup\u00e9s sous la rubrique du Bloc 2 contiennent des nouveaux arguments ce qui pourrait dans certaines circonstances \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 50 des R\u00e8gles, mais il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019ils contiennent des all\u00e9gations incompatibles avec le paragraphe 34. b) de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n[36] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a soutenu que les paragraphes du Bloc 2 ne font que mentionner que JCS Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un montant en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, disposition qui autorise une fiducie \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer une d\u00e9duction pour un montant payable \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Il ajoute que le paragraphe 104(13) oblige la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du montant payable \u00e0 l\u2019inclure dans son revenu alors que le paragraphe 104(24) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une somme est r\u00e9put\u00e9e ne pas \u00eatre payable \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e ou que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019eut le droit d\u2019en exiger le paiement. L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend maintenant que JCS Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction erron\u00e9ment. L\u2019appelant affirme qu\u2019il veut soulever un argument additionnel \u00e0 cet effet. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en affirmant, dans son avis d\u2019appel, que la fiducie a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 104(6), l\u2019appelant indiquait que le montant \u00e9tait payable ou que la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avait le droit d\u2019en exiger le paiement. En revanche, en affirmant, dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, que la fiducie a erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction, l\u2019appelant indique maintenant qu\u2019au moment quand la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la fiducie, le montant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas payable \u00e0 la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Il y a l\u00e0, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, un changement de position de la part de l\u2019appelant.\n[37] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 mes questions, l\u2019appelant a reconnu que les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s contest\u00e9s contiennent \u00ab quelque chose de nouveau \u00bb et il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00ab la fin de la journ\u00e9e, \u00e7a ne change absolument rien puisque JCS Trust n\u2019est pas l\u2019appelante dans cette affaire \u00bb (Transcription aux pp 35-36).\n[38] L\u2019appelant soutient que les alin\u00e9as 50(1)e) et f) des R\u00e8gles lui permettent, dans une r\u00e9plique, d\u2019indiquer toutes autres dispositions l\u00e9gislatives invoqu\u00e9es et tous autres moyens sur lesquels il entend se fonder. Il affirme que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait dans les paragraphes du Bloc 2. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Alors que je ne suis pas en d\u00e9saccord avec ses observations relativement \u00e0 ce qui est autoris\u00e9 par les alin\u00e9as 50(1)e) et f) des R\u00e8gles, ce que l\u2019appelant a tent\u00e9 de faire dans les paragraphes du Bloc 2, outre les paragraphes 83, 84 et 85 que j\u2019aborderai ci-dessous, c\u2019est d\u2019ajouter une nouvelle all\u00e9gation de fait, soit que JCS Trust a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 laquelle elle n\u2019avait pas droit ou a erron\u00e9ment r\u00e9clam\u00e9 cette d\u00e9duction, all\u00e9gation qui est diff\u00e9rente, voire incompatible avec son avis d\u2019appel. Si l\u2019appelant veut faire de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de fait, la r\u00e9plique n\u2019est pas le moyen appropri\u00e9 pour ce faire.\n[39] Les paragraphes 83, 84 et 85 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e contiennent des arguments de l\u2019appelant relativement \u00e0 l\u2019application de la RGA\u00c9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations concernant ces 3 paragraphes pour expliquer comment ces paragraphes sont incompatibles avec le paragraphe 34b) de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. L\u2019appelant aussi n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation \u00e0 ce sujet. Dans son avis d\u2019appel (voir les paragraphes 78 et suivants), l\u2019appelant a fait valoir sa position concernant l\u2019application de la RGA\u00c9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de radier les paragraphes 83, 84 et 85 qui reprennent la position g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019appelant relativement \u00e0 la RGA\u00c9.\n[40] Les paragraphes 37, 38, 39, 45, 50, 55, 61, 63, 64, 67, 71, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, et 86 \u00e0 90 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont incompatibles avec les all\u00e9gations figurant dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel au paragraphe 34b) et soul\u00e8vent de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils sont radi\u00e9s, sans autorisation de les modifier. Les paragraphes 83, 84 et 85 ne sont pas radi\u00e9s.\nBloc 3 d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[41] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que les all\u00e9gations aux paragraphes 41 et 70 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont incompatibles avec les all\u00e9gations figurant dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel au paragraphe 35 lequel se lit comme suit :\n35. Le 31 octobre 2007, Margesca a distribu\u00e9 la somme de 12 719 335,00 $ \u00e0 JCS Trust.\n[42] Les paragraphes 41 et 70 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e se lisent comme suit :\n41. Il nie les all\u00e9gations contenues au du paragraphe 9.29 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019un premier dividende s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 12,719,335 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9tabli le 29 octobre 2007 et pay\u00e9 devenu payable par Margesca \u00e0 JCS Trust le 1er novembre 2007.\n70. Quant au paragraphe 11.1c) de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, il pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019un premier dividende s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 12,719,335 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli le 29 octobre 2007 pour devenir payable par Margesca \u00e0 JCS Trust le 1er novembre 2007.\n[43] Au d\u00e9but de sa plaidoirie, l\u2019appelant a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux paragraphes 41 et 70 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e pour les classifier sous la rubrique du Bloc 3, mais n\u2019a fait aucune repr\u00e9sentation concernant sa position relativement \u00e0 la demande de radiation de ces \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\n[44] Au paragraphe 35 de son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 que Margesca a distribu\u00e9 le montant de plus de 12 millions \u00e0 JCS Trust le 31 octobre 2007 alors qu\u2019aux paragraphes 41 et 70 de sa r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, ce montant serait devenu payable seulement le 1er novembre 2007. Il y a, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, incompatibilit\u00e9 entre l\u2019all\u00e9gation de fait dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e. Pour cette raison, les paragraphes 41 et 70 de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont radi\u00e9s, sans autorisation de les modifier.\nDemandes de radiation de nouvelles questions en litige\n[45] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande la radiation de trois nouvelles questions en litige qui figurent dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e aux paragraphes 74. a), c) et d) et qui se lisent comme suit :\n74. Quant au paragraphe 12 de la R\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, il s\u2019en remet au paragraphe 54 de son avis d\u2019appel. Il ajoute cependant que les questions en litige suivantes devront \u00e9galement \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par cette cour dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel :\na) \u00c0 quelle(s) dates(s) l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sidents du Canada et sont devenus r\u00e9sidents de Monaco?\n\u2026\nc) Est-ce que JCS Trust pouvait l\u00e9galement durant la P\u00e9riode, se pr\u00e9valoir de la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR?\nd) Est-ce que cette cour peut appliquer les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Anti-\u00c9vitement (\u00ab RGAE \u00bb) lorsqu\u2019un contribuable a erron\u00e9ment pris avantage d\u2019une disposition de la LIR (paragraphe 104(6)) \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait pas droit?\n[46] Telle que soulign\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, la question en litige au paragraphe 74. a) est li\u00e9e aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations de fait concernant la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de sa conjointe, all\u00e9gations du Bloc 1 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9es pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus haut. Quant aux paragraphes 74. c) et d) de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e, il s\u2019agit de questions en litige qui d\u00e9coulent des nouvelles all\u00e9gations de fait concernant la question de savoir si JCS Trust s\u2019est pr\u00e9value \u00ab erron\u00e9ment \u00bb de la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, all\u00e9gations du Bloc 2 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux motifs explicit\u00e9s plus hauts.\n[47] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a soutenu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de nouvelles questions (Transcription \u00e0 la p 59). Selon lui, la question ajout\u00e9e au paragraphe 74. c) est une \u00ab question incidente \u00bb \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir quand le montant \u00e9tait payable.\n[48] L\u2019appelant a not\u00e9 que l\u2019article 245 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 dans une question en litige pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et il a qualifi\u00e9e la question ajout\u00e9e au paragraphe 74. d) de \u00ab sous-sous-cat\u00e9gorie de la m\u00eame question \u00bb. Il est vrai que l\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 la question de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 245 dans ses points en litige aux paragraphes 54. f), g) et h) de son avis d\u2019appel, mais telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es, ces questions en litige ne font nulle mention de la question de savoir si JCS Trust s\u2019est pr\u00e9value l\u00e9galement ou erron\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9duction autoris\u00e9e par le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR.\n[49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu aux observations de l\u2019appelant en affirmant qu\u2019il y a \u00ab une \u00e9norme diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019appelant qui \u00e9crit noir sur blanc dans son avis d\u2019appel que Monsieur et Madame sont devenus non-r\u00e9sidents le 30 septembre versus dans sa r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019ils seraient potentiellement devenus non-r\u00e9sidents au mois d\u2019octobre \u00bb (Transcription \u00e0 la p 63). Puisque la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant et de sa conjointe faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019all\u00e9gations de fait admises par l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 explor\u00e9e dans l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable et il s\u2019agit selon l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments auxquels il a le droit de r\u00e9pondre.\n[50] Avec \u00e9gard, selon moi, non seulement s\u2019agit-il de questions en litige qui sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de fait figurant dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9es, mais qui plus est, il s\u2019agit de nouvelles questions en litige ajout\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e. Comme discut\u00e9 plus haut, cela est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de l\u2019appelant de pr\u00e9ciser les points en litige dans son avis d\u2019appel conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 et au formulaire 21(1)a) des R\u00e8gles. En outre, cela n\u2019est pas respectueux de l\u2019article 50 des r\u00e8gles qui ne pr\u00e9voient pas l\u2019ajout de nouvelles questions en litige dans une r\u00e9plique. Pour ces raisons, les nouvelles questions en litige pr\u00e9vues aux paragraphes 74. a), c) et d) de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont radi\u00e9es sans autorisation de les modifier.\nIV. Conclusion\n[51] Il convient de rappeler que lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019objectif de sa requ\u00eate en radiation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019appelant de faire de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, mais plut\u00f4t de contester le choix qu\u2019a fait l\u2019appelant d\u2019inclure ces all\u00e9gations dans une r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que de proc\u00e9der avec une modification de son avis d\u2019appel. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der le prive de son droit de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et constitue un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de modifier son avis d\u2019appel. L\u2019appelant a reconnu que ce fut le cas en pr\u00e9cisant que les parties n\u2019avaient eu qu\u2019une discussion sommaire \u00e0 ce sujet. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ma question de savoir pourquoi l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par une modification de son avis d\u2019appel \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il appert que l\u2019intim\u00e9 y aurait consenti, il a r\u00e9pondu que cela aurait retard\u00e9 ind\u00fbment le processus devant la Cour. Il a ajout\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certain que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait consenti aux modifications de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Avec \u00e9gard, je vois mal comment le fait de proc\u00e9der par modification \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un retard indu plus important que celui cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la modification \u00e0 la r\u00e9plique.\n[52] La requ\u00eate est accueillie, avec d\u00e9pens, et les paragraphes suivants de la r\u00e9plique modifi\u00e9e sont radi\u00e9s, sans autorisation de les modifier : 1f), 1g), 12, 22, 23, 33, 37, 38, 39, 41, 45, 50, 55, 60, 61, 63, 64, 67, 70, 71, 74a), 74c), 74d), 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 et 86 \u00e0 90.

Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate le 30 novembre 2022.\nI. Le contexte\n[2] Le 17 novembre 2020, M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sous le r\u00e9gime de notre proc\u00e9dure informelle. Il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat, et c\u2019est encore le cas. Apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9 eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse, M. Doussot et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont conclu un r\u00e8glement le 11 mars 2022. Le 28 mars 2022, le juge de service a sign\u00e9 le jugement sur consentement qu\u2019on avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 cette semaine\u2011l\u00e0. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9e par les parties et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour \u00e9tait jointe au jugement. Notre Cour a ferm\u00e9 le dossier le 6 avril 2022.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation le 20 avril 2022, M. Doussot a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocate du minist\u00e8re de la Justice qui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qui avait sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement, ainsi qu\u2019au ministre du Revenu national elle\u2011m\u00eame, un courriel dans lequel il affirmait s\u2019opposer officiellement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation et demandait qu\u2019ils ouvrent de nouveau son dossier \u00e0 la Cour. Il affirmait que l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme au r\u00e8glement. M. Doussot a ensuite envoy\u00e9 plusieurs autres courriels \u00e0 l\u2019avocate du minist\u00e8re de la Justice et au ministre.\n[4] Notre greffe, de bon droit, a transmis les courriels du M. Doussot \u00e0 l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de conna\u00eetre la position de l\u2019avocate. Le greffe a ensuite remis les documents au juge francophone principal de la Cour afin qu\u2019il donne des directives sur la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 donner \u00e0 M. Doussot. En raison de la retraite de la juge en chef adjointe bilingue, le juge en chef avait ordonn\u00e9 que les demandes envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 son cabinet en fran\u00e7ais soient remises au juge francophone principal. Ce juge \u00e9tait et est toujours le juge en chef adjoint par int\u00e9rim de la Cour.\n[5] Le greffe a r\u00e9pondu au courriel de M. Doussot le 24 ao\u00fbt 2022. Un agent du greffe a d\u00e9crit de fa\u00e7on juste ce que M. Doussot devait faire :\n\u00ab Si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas d\u2019accord avec la nouvelle cotisation, vous devez d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du chef des appels \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada.\nSi apr\u00e8s avoir fait ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et que vous n\u2019\u00eates pas satisfait de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada ou si nous n\u2019avez pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse apr\u00e8s 90 jours de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition soumis, vous pouvez d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. \u00bb\nII. Le droit et les r\u00e8gles pertinents\n[6] Notre Cour doit tous les jours rendre des jugements sur consentement et expliquer aux contribuables comment d\u00e9poser leurs documents. C\u2019est sans doute le cas de toutes les cours de premi\u00e8re instance. Les fonctionnaires de notre Cour se d\u00e9vouent chaque jour \u00e0 aider les Canadiens qui doivent traiter avec la Cour, et nos juges font de m\u00eame avec les parties qui comparaissent sans avocat. La r\u00e9putation de notre Cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard d\u00e9coule de son \u00e9norme travail. Le juge en chef Marc No\u00ebl de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment affirm\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION]\nComme je l'ai dit, plusieurs ont critiqu\u00e9 cette complexit\u00e9 croissante. Mais pensons \u00e9galement aux parties sans avocat qui ne peuvent payer des services juridiques, mais qui doivent faire face aux m\u00eames complexit\u00e9s. Je profite de l'occasion pour rendre hommage aux juges de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t pour leur travail consid\u00e9rable lorsqu'ils aident des parties sans avocat sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle. Ils font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour informer les contribuables de leurs droits, tout en s'assurant de rester impartiaux. Ce n'est pas facile, mais c'est aussi indispensable. Il faut f\u00e9liciter les juges de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t d'avoir recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure informelle afin de promouvoir l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice. Toutes les cours devraient suivre leur exemple. [1]\n[7] Notre Cour conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gale et est tenue, juridiquement et moralement, de ne pas l\u2019outrepasser. Notre Cour, comme toutes les cours sup\u00e9rieures, a la comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente de r\u00e9gler sa propre proc\u00e9dure. De plus, notre Cour a ses propres r\u00e8gles, selon la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et les R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t; le comit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles veille \u00e0 ce que les R\u00e8gles soient utiles et restent \u00e0 jour.\n[8] Le paragraphe 172(2) des R\u00e8gles porte sur le nouvel examen d\u2019appels dans des circonstances exceptionnelles. On peut facilement trouver les R\u00e8gles au site Web de la Cour. Ce paragraphe exige manifestement le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate, et ne s\u2019applique manifestement que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles :\n172(2) Une partie peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate dans l\u2019instance, selon le cas :\na) l\u2019annulation ou la modification d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu;\n172(2) A party who seeks to,\n(a) have a judgment set aside or varied on the ground of fraud or of facts arising or discovered after it was made,\n\u2026\nmay make a motion for the relief claimed.\n[9] Il est difficile de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019envoi de documents par M. Doussot \u00e0 la Cour comme le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate. Notre greffe lui a conseill\u00e9 de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation le plus r\u00e9cent, celui qui met l\u2019entente en oeuvre, et, si l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avec l\u2019ARC, de d\u00e9poser un nouvel avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 notre Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette nouvelle cotisation et de cette nouvelle opposition. C\u2019est la fa\u00e7on normale et habituelle de demander \u00e0 notre Cour de d\u00e9cider si une entente de r\u00e8glement est valide ou si la nouvelle cotisation qui s\u2019ensuit est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[10] Dans la d\u00e9cision Qu\u00e9bec Fonte inc. c La Reine, 2020 CCI 126, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 :\nAnalyses et conclusions\n33 La Cour a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si une entente entre le fisc et un contribuable qui \u00e9tablit la mani\u00e8re dont un contribuable doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation est applicable, elle a comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes aux ententes en l\u2019absence de circonstances viciant l\u2019op\u00e9ration, et elle a comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de d\u00e9sistements apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Smerchanski c. Ministre du Revenu national, [1977] 2 R.C.S. 23; l\u2019arr\u00eat University Hill Holdings Inc. c. Canada, 2017 CAF 232; les d\u00e9cisions Oberoi c. La Reine, 2006 CCI 293, 1390758 Ontario Corporation c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 572, Huppe c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 644; SoftSim Technologies Inc. c. La Reine, 2012 CCI 181; Davies c. La Reine, 2016 CCI 104, et Granofsky c. La Reine, 2016 CCI 181.\n34 Dans University Hill, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est dite d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure dans Galway c. Ministre du Revenu national [1974] 1 C.F. 600, qui portait sur les jugements par consentement, et dont les principes s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement aux ententes de r\u00e8glement que notre Cour doit faire appliquer, en pr\u00e9cisant que la Cour doit s\u2019assurer \u00ab que le jugement recherch\u00e9 rel\u00e8ve de sa comp\u00e9tence et qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre rendu \u00bb : voir le paragraphe 66 et suivants. Voir aussi le paragraphe 18 de Huppe, o\u00f9 le juge Webb s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\n[11] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2022 CAF 75) a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Qu\u00e9bec Fonte et a affirm\u00e9, au paragraphe 7 : \u00ab Bref, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la CCI s\u2019est bien dirig\u00e9e en droit [...] \u00bb.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[12] M. Doussot a interjet\u00e9 appel de la lettre de notre greffe \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans des motifs assez longs (2022 CAF 199), cette Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel et a affirm\u00e9, au paragraphe 14 :\n[...] une telle demande doit \u00eatre faite par requ\u00eate, et non, comme ici, par la voie d\u2019un simple courriel. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un caprice proc\u00e9dural, mais d\u2019une exigence incontournable, puisque pour r\u00e9ussir, un requ\u00e9rant doit prouver que l\u2019annulation ou la modification du jugement en cause est justifi\u00e9e en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que ledit jugement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Cela requiert une preuve, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCI.\nIV. Le nouvel avis d\u2019opposition\n[13] En raison de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour la requ\u00eate, la Cour croit comprendre que le contribuable a effectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un nouvel avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la nouvelle cotisation mettant en oeuvre le jugement sur consentement. Cependant, cette d\u00e9cision et ces documents indiquent clairement que le ministre \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019\u00e9tait pas valable.\n[14] Il semble que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se soit fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 165(1.2) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, qui interdit les oppositions aux nouvelles cotisations mettant en oeuvre des ententes de r\u00e8glement et des jugements sur consentement.\n[15] Pour les raisons expos\u00e9es dans Qu\u00e9bec Fonte, ce paragraphe n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le contribuable qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s une entente de r\u00e8glement d\u2019affirmer que cette nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente.\n[16] Selon le paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi, M. Doussot pouvait d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son opposition dans les 90 jours suivant la r\u00e9ponse du ministre. L\u2019article 167 dispose qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, le contribuable peut toujours interjeter appel \u00e0 notre Cour dans un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an.\n[17] M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les documents pour sa requ\u00eate dans ce d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an. Vu les circonstances, la Cour accepte de consid\u00e9rer ces documents comme \u00e9tant \u00e9galement une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. La Cour estime \u00e9galement que ces documents, avec les documents que M. Doussot avait d\u2019abord envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 notre Cour, et vu sa comparution \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, satisfont aux exigences du paragraphe 169(5). M. Doussot peut donc faire appel \u00e0 notre Cour au motif que l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente qu\u2019il a conclue avec l\u2019ARC.\n[18] Il semble que M. Doussot ait \u00e9galement communiqu\u00e9 directement avec le cabinet du ministre du Revenu national. Le ministre a notamment r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019on ne pouvait d\u00e9poser d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la nouvelle cotisation en cause. Cela semble \u00eatre manifestement une erreur de droit, m\u00eame si on ne l\u2019a apparemment pas reconnu lors de l\u2019instance \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Notre Cour est manifestement comp\u00e9tente si on affirme, lors d\u2019un appel, qu\u2019une nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 une entente de r\u00e8glement valide, et cela, malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe 165(1.2) de la Loi, qui dispose :\n[...] aucune opposition ne peut \u00eatre faite par un contribuable \u00e0 une cotisation \u00e9tablie en application des paragraphes [...] 169(3) [...]. Il est entendu que cette interdiction vaut pour les oppositions relatives \u00e0 une question pour laquelle le contribuable a renonc\u00e9 par \u00e9crit \u00e0 son droit d\u2019opposition.\n. . . no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection . . . 169(3) . . . nor, for greater certainty, in respect of an issue for which the right of objection has been waived in writing by the taxpayer.\nV. Conclusion\n[19] Malgr\u00e9 le parcours inhabituel, discutable et tr\u00e8s tortueux qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation actuelle, les documents que M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate indiquent clairement ce qui suit :\ni. M. Doussot interjette appel \u00e0 notre Cour de la nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 laquelle il s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 oppos\u00e9;\nii. il conteste la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement;\niii. il affirme que la nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente;\niv. il affirme que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement ne correspond pas \u00e0 l\u2019entente r\u00e9ellement conclue.\n[20] Pour ces motifs, l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate est la suivante :\n1. Le greffe cr\u00e9e un nouveau dossier d\u2019appel. Les documents que M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre un avis d\u2019appel valable d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Au besoin, la Cour accorde une prorogation au titre de l\u2019article 167 de la Loi.\n2. Dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, M. Doussot d\u00e9pose un avis d\u2019appel modifi\u00e9 ou un nouvel avis d\u2019appel qui traite des questions suivantes :\n(1) les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente conclue;\n(2) la question de savoir si le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement correspond \u00e0 l\u2019entente r\u00e9ellement conclue;\n(3) la question de savoir si l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation met correctement en oeuvre cette entente;\n(4) tout autre motif de contestation de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\nCes renseignements sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse comprendre pleinement l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de M. Doussot et y r\u00e9pondre. Ils sont \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaires pour que les parties et la Cour se concentrent sur les questions en litige.\n3. L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9pose sa r\u00e9ponse dans les 60 jours suivant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel modifi\u00e9 de M. Doussot.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, Ontario, ce 3e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nLe juge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 26\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2020-2107(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nTONY DOUSSOT ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Patrick Boyle\nDATE DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE :\nLe 3 mars 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nL\u2019appelant lui\u2011m\u00eame\nAvocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe \u00c9liane Mandeville\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nNom :\nCabinet :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle Sous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Allocution \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence annuelle de 2022 de la Fondation canadienne de fiscalit\u00e9, d\u00e9bat des juges, 20 novembre 2022.

INTRODUCTION\n[1] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande l\u2019annulation de l\u2019appel en pr\u00e9tendant que la Cour n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tente pour accorder la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e. Dans les circonstances inhabituelles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour a mis en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019appel soit entendu en fonction de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que la Cour \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appelante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments complets pour soutenir le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019appel long et d\u00e9taill\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait formul\u00e9, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 a contre-interrog\u00e9 l\u2019appelante et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations compl\u00e8tes. \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 pour des motifs donn\u00e9s de vive voix qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter aux pr\u00e9sentes.\n[2] Les motifs qui suivent expliquent la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019adopter les conclusions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, L.R.C. (1985), ch. T-2, en sa version modifi\u00e9e, et d\u2019annuler l\u2019appel au motif que la Cour n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tente.\nII. ANALYSE\nA. Voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits saillants :\n[3] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il suffit de dire que le grief de l\u2019appelante porte sur le montant du cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour frais de scolarit\u00e9 des dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s de la Saskatchewan (le \u00ab CIFSDS \u00bb) que l\u2019appelante pouvait d\u00e9clarer pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la Saskatchewan qu\u2019elle devait pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2020. Le CIFSDS est un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t provincial conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi de la Saskatchewan intitul\u00e9e Income Tax Act, 2000, S.S., ch. 1-2.01.\n[4] Il convient de noter que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le fait que le ministre a tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du droit de l\u2019appelante au CIFSDS pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition ant\u00e9rieures. En effet, une partie du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e aux mesures prises par les fonctionnaires de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada dans l\u2019application du droit de l\u2019appelante au CIFSDS pour d\u2019autres ann\u00e9es.\nB. Les actes de proc\u00e9dure pertinents de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[5] Le 11 ao\u00fbt 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une annexe, comportant 13 paragraphes. Les passages pertinents pour la question en litige principale concernant la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour et pour la premi\u00e8re question en litige secondaire, celle de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dans le cas d\u2019une partie non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, sont reproduits ci-dessous :\n[traduction]\n1) L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9posera une requ\u00eate le jour de l\u2019audience du pr\u00e9sent appel pour annuler l\u2019appel dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas correctement soumis \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t parce que le pr\u00e9sent appel concerne le montant du cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour frais de scolarit\u00e9 des dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s de la Saskatchewan (le \u00ab CIFSDS \u00bb) que l\u2019appelante pour d\u00e9clarer pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la Saskatchewan qu\u2019elle doit pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2020. Le CIFSDS est un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t provincial conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi [provinciale] intitul\u00e9e Income Tax Act, 2000 [...] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [...], la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux appels interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cotisations \u00e9tablies en vertu de la Income Tax Act, 2000, qui doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la Saskatchewan.\n[...]\n2) [...] 9) Les questions en litige consistent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce qui suit :\na) L\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2020 rel\u00e8ve-t-il de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t? [...]\n10) Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (PGC) s\u2019appuie sur les paragraphes 118.5(1), 165(1), 167(1), 169(1) et 248(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu [...] Le PGC s\u2019appuie \u00e9galement sur le paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et sur les articles 37.1, 37.2, 39.1, 39.11, 98, 99, 102 et 103 de la Income Tax Act, 2000.\n11) Le PGC pr\u00e9tend respectueusement qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner le droit de l\u2019appelante au CIFSDS. En vertu du paragraphe 181(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, la Cour peut soit rejeter un appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une cotisation, soit faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel en annulant la cotisation, en modifiant la cotisation ou en renvoyant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation au ministre pour r\u00e9examen et nouvelle cotisation. La comp\u00e9tence de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux appels concernant les cotisations \u00e9tablies en vertu de la Income Tax Act, 2000, qui doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour du Banc du Roi de la Saskatchewan. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\nC. Les d\u00e9cisions proc\u00e9durales de la Cour\n[6] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, la Cour a invit\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter tous les renseignements et la jurisprudence pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa th\u00e8se. La Cour a observ\u00e9 que si l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point convaincant qu\u2019il semblait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre issue possible que d\u2019ordonner l\u2019annulation de l\u2019appel, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9senterait alors ses observations. Si cette possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre ne permettait pas d\u2019entrevoir quelque espoir de succ\u00e8s dans l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel, la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9vaudrait et l\u2019appel serait annul\u00e9.\n[7] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les conclusions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tablissaient pas une affaire non d\u00e9fendable, la Cour n\u2019a pas invit\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre, indiquant que ces conclusions en r\u00e9ponse sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence seraient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que les parties eurent d\u00e9battu du fond de l\u2019appel. Une partie de ce qui justifiait l\u2019ordre des observations d\u00e9coule des efforts \u00e9vidents d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante pour pr\u00e9parer un expos\u00e9 complet des faits sur plusieurs pages et pour soumettre des douzaines de documents. La Cour craint qu\u2019une erreur sur la question principale de la comp\u00e9tence n\u2019entra\u00eene potentiellement un nouveau proc\u00e8s \u00ab sur le bien-fond\u00e9 \u00bb dans un avenir lointain et que cette proc\u00e9dure ne compromette pas l\u2019obligation de la Cour d\u2019appliquer le droit le jour du proc\u00e8s.\nD. Issue de l\u2019audience\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, au moyen d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire approfondi et respectueux, avec des documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui, y compris l\u2019affidavit de Satvinder K. Hundal du 24 janvier 2023, que l\u2019appelante avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de diverses d\u00e9cisions internes lui attribuant un cr\u00e9dit appropri\u00e9 au titre du CIFSDS ant\u00e9rieur et que l\u2019appel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas m\u00e9ritoire. L\u2019appelante quant \u00e0 elle a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que plusieurs erreurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises ant\u00e9rieurement, mais n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019une des hypoth\u00e8ses formul\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\nE. D\u2019autres observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9es\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ayant pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019issue de son expos\u00e9 initial, l\u2019appelante a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et \u00e0 plaider sa cause et la Cour a jug\u00e9 que les arguments bien affin\u00e9s contenus dans la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient corrects. En fin de compte, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9taient erron\u00e9es et n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de justifier une quelconque mesure de redressement. Nous esp\u00e9rons toutefois que l\u2019appelante demandera un r\u00e9examen de ses griefs ant\u00e9rieurs si elle est en mesure d\u2019obtenir des documents clairs de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa indiquant qu\u2019une erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses r\u00e9sultats scolaires ant\u00e9rieurs, ainsi que les co\u00fbts et les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9s pour parvenir \u00e0 cette r\u00e9ussite.\nF. Une recension de la jurisprudence sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour\n(1) Commentaire introductif [10] En guise d\u2019introduction, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ne pas d\u00e9poser un dossier bien avant l\u2019audience a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure scind\u00e9e adopt\u00e9e par la Cour. La controverse \u00e0 laquelle la Cour est confront\u00e9e le matin de l\u2019audience est la suivante : soit prendre quelques heures pour examiner les dossiers fournis au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, soit permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, f\u00e9brile, d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant. L\u2019analyse de la Cour a surtout consist\u00e9 \u00e0 estimer que l\u2019examen des affaires n\u00e9cessiterait au moins trois heures. La partie qui se repr\u00e9sentait elle-m\u00eame aurait eu besoin de beaucoup moins de temps pour rassembler ses documents, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait impatiente de commencer, comme on l\u2019a vu; la Cour a ainsi choisi d\u2019entendre l\u2019affaire. Par la suite, une d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait rendue sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence.\n[11] Cette difficult\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9e avec un recueil de jurisprudence. Il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que la Cour a eu besoin d\u2019environ six heures pour examiner de mani\u00e8re approfondie les d\u00e9cisions soumises et les autres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pertinents que la Cour a recherch\u00e9s.\n(2) Le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif impose une conception \u00e9troite de la comp\u00e9tence [12] Il sera utile d\u2019analyser la jurisprudence au moyen d\u2019un examen th\u00e9matique pour montrer que la Couronne a raison d\u2019affirmer que le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif restreint consid\u00e9rablement la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n(3) La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est un tribunal d\u2019origine purement l\u00e9gislative. [13] Tout d\u2019abord, la d\u00e9cision Andrew Paving & Engineering Ltd. and Meld Development Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, 84 DTC 1157, tranch\u00e9e par le juge en chef adjoint Christie, retient notre attention. Le long passage pertinent se trouve \u00e0 la page 1161 :\n[traduction]\nLa Cour n\u2019est pas comp\u00e9tente pour statuer sur ces pr\u00e9sents appels dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils concernent les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s impos\u00e9es et les int\u00e9r\u00eats per\u00e7us en rapport avec la somme de 18 067,21 $. L\u2019existence d\u2019un accord de perception conclu entre le gouvernement du Canada et celui de l\u2019Ontario ne peut modifier ce fait. La section E de la Loi de l\u2019Ontario dispose que les appels des cotisations faites en vertu de cette loi sont port\u00e9s devant la Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario. Aucune disposition de la Loi, de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, ou de toute autre loi adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement du Canada ne vise \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer cette comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est d\u2019origine purement l\u00e9gislative et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de sa juridiction est d\u00e9limit\u00e9e par les dispositions expresses ou n\u00e9cessairement implicites du texte l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. De plus, je suis d\u2019avis que si la loi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement en vue de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t le pouvoir d\u2019entendre les appels des cotisations faites en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019Ontario, le Parlement aurait outrepass\u00e9 les limites de sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en vertu de l\u2019article 101 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, qui dispose ce qui suit :\nLe parlement du Canada pourra, nonobstant toute disposition contraire \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente loi, lorsque l\u2019occasion le requerra, adopter des mesures \u00e0 l\u2019effet de cr\u00e9er, maintenir et organiser une cour g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019appel pour le Canada, et \u00e9tablir des tribunaux additionnels pour la meilleure administration des lois du Canada. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[14] Je voudrais maintenant invoquer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019affaire Hennick c. Canada, [1998] A.C.I. no 562, un jugement du juge Bowman, plus tard juge en chef de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit aux paragraphes 11 et 12 :\n11 Le juge en chef adjoint Christie a dit, dans l\u2019affaire Lamash Estate v. M.N.R., 91 DTC 9, \u00e0 la page 16 :\nR\u00e9flexion faite, je suis encore plus convaincu que la Cour n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence mentionn\u00e9e. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est une pure cr\u00e9ation de la loi et sa comp\u00e9tence se limite \u00e0 ce qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 express\u00e9ment par le Parlement et \u00e0 ce qui se d\u00e9duit n\u00e9cessairement de ce qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 express\u00e9ment. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\nLa Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est d\u2019origine purement l\u00e9gislative et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de sa juridiction est d\u00e9limit\u00e9e par les dispositions expresses ou n\u00e9cessairement implicites du texte l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[15] Voir \u00e0 nouveau Andrew Paving & Engineering Ltd. et Meld Development Ltd. v. M.N.R., 84 DTC 1157, p. 1161, ainsi que Hennick c. Canada, [1998] A.C.I. no 562, par. 11.\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gardner c. Canada, [2001] A.C.F. no 1954, 2001 CAF 401, les juges Stone, Rothstein et Sexton ont fourni des indications pr\u00e9cieuses sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t au paragraphe 16. Comme l\u2019\u00e9crit le juge Sexton pour la Cour : Tant le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que les provinces ont le pouvoir d\u2019adopter des lois concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.

Dans le cadre d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 169(1), elle ne peut qu\u2019accorder l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des mesures de r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 171(1), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire annuler ou modifier la cotisation, ou la d\u00e9f\u00e9rer au ministre pour nouvel examen.\n(7) L\u2019importance de l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [23] Voici les paragraphes 8 et 9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat A&E Precision Fabricating and Machine Shop Inc. c.

Premi\u00e8rement :\n[26] Dans ce contexte, voici les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui d\u00e9finissent la comp\u00e9tence et la mission de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t en ce qui a trait aux appels des cotisations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Le paragraphe 12(1) de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, L.R.C. 1985, ch. T-2, consacre cette comp\u00e9tence. Cette disposition se lit comme suit :\n12. (1) La Cour a comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour entendre les renvois et les appels port\u00e9s devant elle sur les questions d\u00e9coulant de l'application de ... la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces lois pr\u00e9voient un droit de renvoi ou d'appel devant elle.\n12. (1) The Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine references and appeals to the Court on matters arising under ... the Income Tax Act... when references or appeals to the Court are provided for in those Acts.\n[27] Pour comprendre la mission de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t en ce qui a trait aux appels en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il est utile de commencer par le paragraphe 152(8) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, qui consacre l\u2019effet juridique d\u2019une cotisation. Elle est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n152. (8) Sous r\u00e9serve des modifications qui peuvent y \u00eatre apport\u00e9es ou de son annulation lors d'une opposition ou d'un appel fait en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie et sous r\u00e9serve d'une nouvelle cotisation, une cotisation est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre valide et ex\u00e9cutoire malgr\u00e9 toute erreur, tout vice de forme ou toute omission dans cette cotisation ou dans toute proc\u00e9dure s'y rattachant en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n152. (8) An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\n[25] Je consid\u00e8re que la reproduction des paragraphes qui suivent aidera l\u2019appelante \u00e0 mieux comprendre le r\u00e9sultat :\n[28] Les paragraphes 165(1) et 169(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu accordent au contribuable le droit de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 une cotisation (il s\u2019agit essentiellement d\u2019un processus administratif) et d\u2019ensuite interjeter appel par la suite \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la cotisation devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Ces dispositions sont ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9es :\n165. (1) Le contribuable qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une cotisation pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente partie peut signifier au ministre, par \u00e9crit, un avis d\u2019opposition exposant les motifs de son opposition et tous les faits pertinents, dans les d\u00e9lais suivants :\n169. (1) Lorsqu\u2019un contribuable a signifi\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 une cotisation, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article165, il peut interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour faire annuler ou modifier la cotisation [...]\n[26] Le paragraphe 171(1) \u00e9nonce les mani\u00e8res dont la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t peut disposer de l\u2019appel. Il est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n171. (1) La Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t peut statuer sur un appel:\na) en le rejetant;\nb) en l'admettant et en :\n(i) annulant la cotisation,\n(ii) modifiant la cotisation,\n(iii) d\u00e9f\u00e9rant la cotisation au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation.\n171. (1) The Tax Court of Canada may dispose of an appeal by:\n(a) dismissing it; or\n(b) allowing it and\n(i) vacating the assessment,\n(ii) varying the assessment, or\n(iii) referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[27] L\u2019article 166 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu limite les motifs en vertu desquels une cotisation d\u2019annulation ou de modification en appel. Il est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n166. Une cotisation ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9e ni modifi\u00e9e lors d'un appel uniquement par suite d'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, de vice de forme, d'omission ou d'erreur de la part de qui que ce soit dans l'observation d'une disposition simplement directrice de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n166. An assessment shall not be vacated or varied on appeal by reason only of any irregularity, informality, omission or error on the part of any person in the observation of any directory provision of this Act.\n[28] En guise de mise en \u00e9vidence et pour \u00e9viter tout manque de clart\u00e9, le juge Stratas a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Pereira c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2017] A.C.F. no 1195. J\u2019ai reproduit ci-dessous ses observations au paragraphe 15 :\n15 La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner ce motif. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a comp\u00e9tence que pour examiner la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une cotisation, et non les mesures d\u2019ex\u00e9cution prises par l\u2019Agence de revenu du Canada. Les d\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale par voie de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, mais pas devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Voir par exemple A&E Precision Fabricating and Machine Shop Inc. c. Canada, 2013 CAF 173, au paragraphe 9. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\nLa validit\u00e9 et l\u2019exactitude de la cotisation sont les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration, et non le comportement des fonctionnaires lors de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation\n(8) Aucun pouvoir de modification de la l\u00e9gislation\n[29] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente question li\u00e9e \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence dans la d\u00e9cision MacKay c. Canada, [2015] A.C.F. no 456, 2015 CAF 94, et a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 et la sagesse de ce jugement. Les juges Ryer, Near et Rennie ont tranch\u00e9 comme suit :\n[2] Le pr\u00e9sent appel est inhabituel vu que l\u2019appelant ne soutient pas que le montant de la cotisation \u00e9tablie \u00e0 son \u00e9gard pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, au titre des imp\u00f4ts, des int\u00e9r\u00eats et des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, est inexact. Il soutient plut\u00f4t que le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par suite de l\u2019application de la formule pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 34.1 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est injuste et injustifi\u00e9. Il soutient essentiellement que la formule pr\u00e9vue par cette disposition de la Loi devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e. Malheureusement, notre Cour n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de modifier la loi. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[30] Il convient \u00e9galement de noter l\u2019affaire Meyer c. La Reine, [2019] A.C.I. no 103, 2019 CCI 131, sous la plume de la juge Lafleur, qui illustre la vitalit\u00e9 continue de la d\u00e9cision Chaya. En raison de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gance du langage utilis\u00e9 par la juge Lafleur, je pense qu\u2019il est judicieux de simplement reproduire ses sages paroles :\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, M. Meyer a soutenu que la somme de 79 089 $ qu\u2019il a retir\u00e9e de son REER n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre incluse dans le calcul de son revenu aux fins du remboursement de prestations de l\u2019assurance-emploi en application de l\u2019article 145 de la LAE, car la somme retir\u00e9e de son REER, \u00e9tant d\u2019une nature diff\u00e9rente, ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un revenu aux fins de la LAE.\n[5] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 les dispositions pertinentes de la LIR et de LAE \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les sommes retir\u00e9es d\u2019un REER (en application du paragraphe 146(8) de la LIR) doivent \u00eatre incluses dans le calcul du revenu en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 56(1)h) et de l\u2019article 3 de la LIR. Par cons\u00e9quent, le montant de 79 089 $ devait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Meyer aux fins de l\u2019application des articles 144 et 145 de la LAE. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement habilement expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour que M. Meyer voudrait probablement que le Parlement modifie l\u2019article 144 de la LAE pour exclure les sommes retir\u00e9es d\u2019un REER du calcul du revenu, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la modification apport\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des paiements issus de r\u00e9gimes enregistr\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[6] M. Meyer a inform\u00e9 la Cour qu\u2019il comprenait d\u00e9sormais mieux les dispositions pertinentes et qu\u2019il ne pouvait obtenir gain de cause.\n[7] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Meyer que le r\u00f4le de notre Cour, dans le cadre d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 en application de la LIR, \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si la cotisation en cause \u00e9tait valide et correcte eu \u00e9gard aux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables et aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (Ereiser c. La Reine, 2013 CAF 20, 2013 DTC 5036, au paragraphe 31). Les m\u00eames principes s\u2019appliquent aux fins de la LAE.

La Reine, [2007] A.C.I. no 473, 2007 CCI 682, une d\u00e9cision de la juge Miller. La question de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour s\u2019est pos\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t de l\u2019Ontario. La contribuable a fait valoir qu\u2019il existait une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle selon laquelle aucun appel ne pouvait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une cotisation pour laquelle aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00fb en raison du cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t. L\u2019essentiel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour, qui est utile au soussign\u00e9, est expos\u00e9 ci-dessous :\n[6] Le cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le CIEO, soit un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t de l\u2019Ontario qui est accord\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 4(6) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de l\u2019Ontario. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un imp\u00f4t provincial, et la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rendre un jugement sur la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une cotisation d\u2019imp\u00f4t provincial sur le revenu. (Voir Sutcliffe v. The Queen, [2005] 1 C.T.C. 149, au paragraphe 14 et Hennick c. Canada, [1998] A.C.I. no 562, au paragraphe 9.)\n[7] Le dernier moyen que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a invoqu\u00e9 pour s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la requ\u00eate demandant le rejet de l\u2019appel \u00e9tait que la question en litige portait sur le calcul d\u2019un montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t payable en vertu de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Selon le paragraphe 23(2.1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de l\u2019Ontario, aucun appel d\u2019une cotisation ne peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario relativement au calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable en application de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a implicitement comp\u00e9tence pour entendre le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[8] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelante.

La Reine, [2020] A.C.I. no 112, 2020 CCI 136, une d\u00e9cision de la juge Wong. Les passages pertinents sont les suivants :\nAux termes d\u2019un accord avec l\u2019Alberta, le ministre calcule le montant de la PEFA et de la RLCAB en fonction des renseignements contenus dans la d\u00e9claration de revenus d\u2019un particulier.

Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Jersak lors de l\u2019audience, la Loi sur la PUGE est une loi courte et ne semble pas comporter de m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9solution des litiges.

La Reine, 2017 CCI 220, est repris ci-dessous :\n[4] Je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre les appels interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ayant rejet\u00e9 une demande de PUGE et de CIEFA. La PUGE est pr\u00e9vue dans la Loi sur la prestation universelle pour la garde d\u2019enfants f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais ni cette loi ni toute autre loi ne conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Cour la comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de PUGE. Le jugement Goldstein c. La Reine, 2013 CCI 165 (inf.), confirme cette conclusion. Le CIEFA est pr\u00e9vu dans la Alberta Personal Income Tax Act, qui est une loi provinciale. La Cour n\u2019a aucune comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des lois provinciales. De plus, la loi de l\u2019Alberta qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta la comp\u00e9tence pour entendre les appels des d\u00e9terminations relatives au CIEFA. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[38] La derni\u00e8re phrase soulign\u00e9e fait \u00e9cho \u00e0 l\u2019argumentation de la Couronne intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, puisque la Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, sans contestation, comme la voie de redressement correcte, bien que ni la Cour ni la Couronne n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9celer une seule d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e d\u00e9montrant le recours \u00e0 cette Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[39] Je note \u00e9galement que le juge Russell a fait observer ce qui suit, au paragraphe 3 : [...] Mme Perron a re\u00e7u signification de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate et d\u2019une copie de la r\u00e9ponse modifi\u00e9e propos\u00e9e quelques jours avant. \u00c9videmment, d\u00e9terminer si une question de comp\u00e9tence a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e ou soulev\u00e9e ou non par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties n\u2019a de toute fa\u00e7on aucune incidence sur la comp\u00e9tence m\u00eame de la Cour.\n[40] En outre, les commentaires suivants sont pertinents :\n15 [...] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour consiste simplement \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir si les nouvelles d\u00e9terminations \u00e9tablies par le ministre au sujet de la PFCE et du cr\u00e9dit pour la TPS\/TVH sont bien fond\u00e9es ou non. Aucune disposition de la Loi ne permet au ministre ou \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019examiner le facteur des difficult\u00e9s excessives si le pr\u00e9sent appel quant auxdits cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait par ailleurs pas accueilli. Ce serait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l\u2019Alberta d\u2019examiner ce facteur dans l\u2019exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale consistant \u00e0 fixer des paiements de pension alimentaire appropri\u00e9s dans le contexte global du droit de la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Perron.\n[41] La juge Woods, aujourd\u2019hui membre de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans l\u2019affaire Goldstein c. La Reine, [2013] A.C.I. no 131, 2013 CCI 165. La d\u00e9cision indique d\u2019embl\u00e9e que \u00ab 1. l\u2019appel portant sur la Loi sur la prestation universelle pour la garde d\u2019enfants soit annul\u00e9 [...] \u00bb. La Cour a ensuite fait remarquer au paragraphe 3 ce qui suit : [3] Il y a deux questions pr\u00e9liminaires. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 en vertu de la LPUGE doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9, parce que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour trancher les appels interjet\u00e9s en vertu de cette loi : Fatima c. La Reine, 2012 CCI 49.\n[42] La juge Woods a \u00e9galement rendu un jugement dans l\u2019affaire Fatima, 2012 CCI 49, et je trouve utile de reproduire les paragraphes 5 et 6, qui servent \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi la Cour a annul\u00e9 l\u2019appel concernant les prestations au titre de la Loi sur la prestation universelle pour la garde d\u2019enfants.\n[5] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a comp\u00e9tence relativement \u00e0 la LPUGE. L\u2019avocate de la Couronne a r\u00e9pondu que la question de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait la m\u00eame au regard des deux lois et que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour concernant la prestation fiscale pour enfants sous le r\u00e9gime de la LIR serait suivie pour l\u2019application de la LPUGE. Cela constitue peut-\u00eatre une solution pratique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, mais la question de la comp\u00e9tence aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9ponse. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[6] Dans la d\u00e9cision Moise c La Reine, 2009 CCI 187, la juge Sheridan a conclu que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence relativement \u00e0 la LPUGE. Je ne vois aucune raison de m\u2019\u00e9carter de cette norme. L\u2019appel relatif aux prestations pr\u00e9vues par la LPUGE sera donc annul\u00e9.\n[43] En ce qui concerne la d\u00e9cision Moise c. La Reine, [2009] A.C.I. no 140, 2009 CCI 187, tranch\u00e9e par la juge Sheridan, elle soutient l\u2019observation de la Couronne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme il est dit au paragraphe 3 :\n[3] Au cours de l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9, \u00e0 juste titre, une objection pr\u00e9liminaire, affirmant que l\u2019appelante ne pouvait pas inclure dans son appel une demande de redressement pour sa r\u00e9clamation faite en vertu de la Loi sur la prestation universelle pour la garde d\u2019enfants. Le fondement de l\u2019objection \u00e9tait que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence dans les appels de cette nature. L\u2019appelante l\u2019a admis et s\u2019est finalement d\u00e9sist\u00e9e de cet aspect de son appel.\n(10) Une affaire qui r\u00e9sume bien l\u2019examen de la jurisprudence qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de\n[44] La d\u00e9cision Bauer c.

[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[25] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Main, le juge Rothstein, alors juge, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[8] Il en est ainsi parce que l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 sur le fondement de l\u2019article 169 met en cause la validit\u00e9 de la cotisation et non du processus ayant conduit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablir [...] Autrement dit, il ne s\u2019agit pas de d\u00e9terminer si les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ADRC ont correctement exerc\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs, mais plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si les montants pouvaient valablement \u00eatre cotis\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi [...] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[26] Apr\u00e8s avoir confirm\u00e9 le principe de l\u2019arr\u00eat Main, la Cour, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ereiser, a conclu ceci : \u00ab [...] il est \u00e9vident et manifeste que la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019annule pas les nouvelles cotisations vis\u00e9es par l\u2019appel en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en se fondant uniquement sur la conduite fautive du fonctionnaire du fisc qui les a autoris\u00e9es \u00bb. La juge Sharlow a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[31] [L]a mission de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t lors d\u2019un appel dirig\u00e9 contre une cotisation d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 et le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cotisation en fonction des dispositions applicables de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et des faits donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019obligation du contribuable pr\u00e9vue par la loi. En toute logique, la conduite du fonctionnaire du fisc qui autorise l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cotisation n\u2019est pas pertinente pour d\u00e9terminer cette obligation pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Il est \u00e9vident que la conduite fautive d\u2019un fonctionnaire du fisc n\u2019est pas pertinente quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la validit\u00e9 ou du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la cotisation. [...]\n[27] M\u00eame si la conduite de l\u2019ARC menant \u00e0 une cotisation est fautive, notre Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence.

Introduction [1] L'appelante, Marlene Enns, interjette appel de la cotisation \u00e9tablie le 12 avril 2017 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au titre de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'un avis d'opposition, la cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 ratifi\u00e9e le 25 octobre 2018.\nII. Les faits [2] \u00c0 l'audience, les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un [traduction] \u00ab expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et un recueil de pi\u00e8ces \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce 1). Les parties n'ont appel\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin.\n[3] Essentiellement, selon l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, le mari de Mme Enns, Peter Enns, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 22 mai 2013, laissant l'appelante veuve. Il \u00e9tait le seul rentier d'un r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d'\u00e9pargne\u2011retraite (REER) et avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 Mme Enns \u00e0 titre d'unique b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de ce REER. Mme Enns n'a offert aucune contrepartie en \u00e9change de cette d\u00e9signation.\n[4] Ainsi, quelque temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Enns, la juste valeur marchande du REER en question, soit 102 789,52 $, a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Enns. (Cette derni\u00e8re a ensuite transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les fonds dans son compte de retraite immobilis\u00e9.)\n[5] Le 12 avril 2017, lors de l'\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation en litige, la succession de M. Enns devait un imp\u00f4t de 146 382,05 $ pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2004 \u00e0 2012 de celui\u2011ci.\nIII. Dispositions l\u00e9gales [6] Le paragraphe 160(1) de la Loi dispose notamment :\n160(1) Transfert de biens entre personnes ayant un lien de d\u00e9pendance \u2014 Lorsqu'une personne a, depuis le 1er mai 1951, transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens, directement ou indirectement, au moyen d'une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l'une des personnes suivantes :\na) son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou une personne devenue depuis son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait;\n[...]\nles r\u00e8gles suivantes s'appliquent :\n[...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\nIV. La question en litige [7] Mme Enns affirme qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Enns, lorsque le droit aux fonds du REER de M. Enns lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9, elle avait cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre son \u00e9pouse : elle \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t sa veuve. La question en litige est de savoir si c'\u00e9tait effectivement le cas, c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire si, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Enns, Mme Enns a cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre son \u00e9pouse pour l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a). Autrement dit, le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) inclut\u2011il le veuf ou la veuve du d\u00e9biteur fiscal auteur du transfert?\n[8] L'intim\u00e9 est d'avis qu'au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Enns, le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) s'appliquait toujours \u00e0 Mme Enns.\nV. Analyse [9] Dans deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes, notre Cour s'est pench\u00e9e sur le sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a). La premi\u00e8re est la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk c. La Reine, 2013 CCI 60.\n[10] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk, la juge Lamarre (plus tard juge en chef adjointe) a examin\u00e9 des circonstances presque identiques sur le fond aux pr\u00e9sentes. La juge s'est exprim\u00e9e en ces termes aux paragraphes 25 et 26 :\n25. Si l'on tient pour acquis que l'auteur du transfert est l'ex\u2011mari, il n'\u00e9tait pas uni \u00e0 l'appelante par les liens du mariage au moment o\u00f9 elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir droit aux prestations du REER. En effet, le mariage prend fin \u00e0 la mort d'un des deux \u00e9poux ou quand un jugement irr\u00e9vocable de divorce est prononc\u00e9. [...]\n26. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'appelante et son ex\u2011mari n'\u00e9taient plus unis par les liens du mariage au moment du transfert \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'appelante n'\u00e9tait plus l'\u00e9pouse de ce dernier [...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[11] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk, la question du sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas explicitement. N\u00e9anmoins, comme on le constate, la juge r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette question pr\u00e9cise : le mariage prend fin \u00e0 la mort, et l'\u00e9pouse du mari, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de celui\u2011ci, n'en est plus l'\u00e9pouse. Ainsi, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari et donc \u00e0 la fin de leur mariage, l'\u00e9pouse, ou plut\u00f4t l'ancienne \u00e9pouse, n'\u00e9tait plus son \u00e9pouse et, de ce fait, la juge a conclu que la cotisation \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'ancienne \u00e9pouse au titre de l'article 160 \u00e9tait invalide. La d\u00e9cision n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel.\n[12] La plus r\u00e9cente des deux d\u00e9cisions est la d\u00e9cision Kuchta c. La Reine, 2015 CCI 289. \u00c0 l'instar de la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk, les faits essentiels dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta \u00e9taient presque les m\u00eames que ceux en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans l'affaire Kuchta, mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Graham s'est pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique pour interpr\u00e9ter le sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a). Il s'agit de l'analyse d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601, 2005 CSC 54.\n[13] Dans l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, la Cour supr\u00eame, instaurant cette nouvelle approche analytique \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois, exprime les principes directeurs en ces termes aux paragraphes 10 \u00e0 13 :\n10. Il est depuis longtemps \u00e9tabli en mati\u00e8re d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois qu'\u00ab il faut lire les termes d'une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s'harmonise avec l'esprit de la loi, l'objet de la loi et l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb [...] L'interpr\u00e9tation d'une disposition l\u00e9gislative doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s'harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble. Lorsque le libell\u00e9 d'une disposition est pr\u00e9cis et non \u00e9quivoque, le sens ordinaire des mots joue un r\u00f4le primordial dans le processus d'interpr\u00e9tation. Par contre, lorsque les mots utilis\u00e9s peuvent avoir plus d'un sens raisonnable, leur sens ordinaire joue un r\u00f4le moins important. L'incidence relative du sens ordinaire, du contexte et de l'objet sur le processus d'interpr\u00e9tation peut varier, mais les tribunaux doivent, dans tous les cas, chercher \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions d'une loi comme formant un tout harmonieux.\n11. [...] De nos jours, il ne fait aucun doute que toutes les lois, y compris la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique. Cependant, le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis de nombreuses dispositions fiscales a souvent incit\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre l'accent sur l'interpr\u00e9tation textuelle. Lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9cise les conditions \u00e0 remplir pour obtenir un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9, on peut raisonnablement supposer qu'il a voulu que le contribuable s'appuie sur ces dispositions pour obtenir le r\u00e9sultat qu'elles prescrivent.\n12. Les dispositions de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer l'uniformit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 requises pour que les contribuables puissent organiser intelligemment leurs affaires. [...]\nVoir \u00e9galement l'arr\u00eat 65302 British Columbia, par. 51, o\u00f9 le juge Iacobucci cite P.W. Hogg et J.E. Magee, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (2e \u00e9d. 1997), p. 475\u2011476 :\n[traduction] La Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu serait empreinte d'une incertitude intol\u00e9rable si le libell\u00e9 clair d'une disposition d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de la Loi \u00e9tait nuanc\u00e9 par des exceptions qui n'y sont pas exprim\u00e9es, provenant de la conception qu'un tribunal a de l'objet de la disposition.\n13. La Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu demeure un instrument domin\u00e9 par des dispositions explicites qui prescrivent des cons\u00e9quences particuli\u00e8res et commandent une interpr\u00e9tation largement textuelle. \u00c0 cet ensemble de dispositions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, le l\u00e9gislateur a greff\u00e9 une disposition d'un genre bien diff\u00e9rent, la RGA\u00c9, qui est une disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale destin\u00e9e \u00e0 invalider, pour le motif qu'ils constituent de l'\u00e9vitement fiscal abusif, des m\u00e9canismes qui seraient acceptables selon une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale d'autres dispositions de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. [...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[14] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, le juge Graham, en appliquant l'analyse d'interpr\u00e9tation \u00ab textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique \u00bb dont il est fait mention dans l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, a conclu, lors de l'analyse \u00ab textuelle \u00bb, que le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb dans le cas du mariage signifie une relation entre deux personnes vivantes. La Cour a aussi conclu que le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb avait \u00e9galement un sens plus \u00ab familier \u00bb, puisqu'\u00e0 l'occasion, il s'entendait d'une personne qui, en raison du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint, \u00e9tait le veuf ou la veuve de la personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. La Cour a conclu que, compte tenu de ce sens familier, textuellement, l'utilisation du mot \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb cr\u00e9ait une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9.\n[15] Ensuite, lors de l'analyse \u00ab contextuelle \u00bb selon l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, la Cour a cibl\u00e9 quatre dispositions de la Loi qui traitent de la mort et qui utilisent le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb comme incluant la personne qui \u00e9tait l'\u00e9poux du contribuable au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire selon le sens familier mentionn\u00e9 plus haut. Les quatre dispositions sont les paragraphes 70(6), 72(2), 146(8.2) et 146(8.91). Toutefois, d'autres dispositions (p. ex. les paragraphes 146(1) \u00ab remboursements de primes \u00bb, 146(5.1), 147.3(7) et 248(23.1)) n'utilisent le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb que dans son sens juridique ou litt\u00e9ral, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. le conjoint d'une personne vivante. Ainsi, l'analyse \u00ab contextuelle \u00bb s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e non d\u00e9terminante.\n[16] Quant \u00e0 l'analyse \u00ab t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique \u00bb, la Cour a conclu que, pour l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a), ni l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur ni une raison de politique n'exclut les veufs et les veuves \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d'un REER. Selon la Cour, cela rompait l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 lors des analyses \u00ab textuelle \u00bb et \u00ab contextuelle \u00bb et menait \u00e0 la conclusion qu'au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a), le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb s'entend \u00e9galement des veufs et des veuves; en d'autres termes, les \u00e9poux continuent d'\u00eatre des \u00e9poux apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'un d'eux.\n[17] En outre, \u00e0 la conclusion de son analyse dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, le juge Graham a fourni des explications au paragraphe 78, renvoyant aux paragraphes 70(6), 72(2), 146(8.2) et 146(8.91) susmentionn\u00e9s de la Loi, o\u00f9 le mot \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb inclut clairement les veufs et les veuves :\n78. Si le l\u00e9gislateur avait syst\u00e9matiquement utilis\u00e9 le sens juridique du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb dans la Loi, je n'aurais pas conclu que le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb inclut les veuves et les veufs au paragraphe 160(1), malgr\u00e9 le fait que ce terme ait un sens familier et que l'analyse t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique penche fortement pour cette interpr\u00e9tation. L'ajout d'une autre formulation dans des dispositions telles que le paragraphe 146(8.8) afin d'inclure de mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re les veuves et les veufs m'aurait convaincu de l'absence d'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 textuelle dans l'utilisation du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb au paragraphe 160(1). [...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[18] Comme l'a affirm\u00e9 le juge Graham, n'eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 les quatre dispositions susmentionn\u00e9es de la Loi o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur a utilis\u00e9 le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb comme incluant clairement les veufs et les veuves, il s'en serait tenu \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation textuelle pure et simple, \u00e0 savoir le sens ordinaire du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb, qui d\u00e9crit une relation entre deux personnes vivantes.\n[19] Ainsi, dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, la Cour a conclu que l'appelante, la veuve du d\u00e9funt, en demeurait \u00e9galement l'\u00e9pouse pour l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a). Par cons\u00e9quent, la cotisation \u00e9tablie au titre de l'article 160 qui faisait l'objet de l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e valide.\n[20] Un autre aspect de la d\u00e9cision Kuchta doit \u00eatre pris en compte. C'est mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Jorr\u00e9 qui a initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de l'appel et qui l'a entendu. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, comme aucune d\u00e9cision n'avait encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, le juge en chef de la Cour a r\u00e9affect\u00e9 l'affaire au juge Graham. Le juge Graham a rendu sa d\u00e9cision r\u00e9sum\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus en temps opportun, en se fondant sur les transcriptions et sur le dossier de la Cour, avec le consentement des parties, ainsi que sur les observations orales suppl\u00e9mentaires que les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 sa demande. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait appel de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[21] Cependant, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l'arr\u00eat High\u2011Crest Enterprises Limited c. Canada, [2018] 2 R.C.F. 2017, 2017 CAF 88, a examin\u00e9 une situation semblable concernant le remplacement d'un juge, quoique dans le cas d'une question fiscale enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. La majorit\u00e9 des juges a conclu que la d\u00e9cision du juge rempla\u00e7ant \u00e9tait nulle et que le jugement devait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre rendu par le juge qui avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de l'affaire et qui l'avait entendue.\n[22] Au vu de l'arr\u00eat High-Crest, on remet maintenant parfois en question la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Kuchta. Toutefois, puisque cette d\u00e9cision n'a pas fait l'objet d'un appel, on ne saurait dire si le tribunal d'appel aurait rendu une d\u00e9cision similaire.\n[23] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 s'appuie principalement sur la d\u00e9cision Kuchta et maintient que l'analyse qui y est faite est solide, que la d\u00e9cision n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, je devrais appliquer le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire et me conformer \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision. L'intim\u00e9 critique la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk, car elle ne r\u00e9pond pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 la question du sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, question qu'il faut \u00e9galement trancher en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[24] De plus, lors des observations orales, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle souscrivait \u00e0 l'affirmation de l'appelante selon laquelle le bien en question, \u00e0 savoir le droit aux fonds du REER de feu M. Enns, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de M. Enns plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 une date ant\u00e9rieure ou ult\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\n[25] L'avocat de l'appelante invoque la d\u00e9cision Kiperchuk, que je r\u00e9sume plus haut, dans laquelle la Cour a conclu que, pour l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a), une personne perd sa qualit\u00e9 d'\u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son conjoint et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le veuf ou la veuve de la personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e n'est plus l'\u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[26] L'avocat de l'appelante invoque aussi l'arr\u00eat Will\u2011Kare Paving & Contracting Ltd. c. Canada, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 915, 2000 CSC 36. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour a examin\u00e9 le sens ordinaire du terme \u00ab vente \u00bb utilis\u00e9 dans la Loi. Au nom de la majorit\u00e9, le juge Major conclut que ce terme a un sens juridique bien \u00e9tabli et reconnu, et que c'est ce sens que l'on devrait utiliser pour l'application de la Loi, plut\u00f4t qu'un sens plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9riv\u00e9 de l'usage courant. La Cour fait \u00e9galement une distinction entre l'asphalte vendu comme un article distinct (conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un contrat de vente d'asphalte comme tel) et l'asphalte vendu comme un de plusieurs articles n\u00e9cessaires en ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat de pavage (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. un contrat de fourniture d'ouvrage et de mat\u00e9riaux).\n[27] Comme l'a indiqu\u00e9 l'avocat de l'appelante, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a parl\u00e9 en 2016, soit apr\u00e8s l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, du principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Will\u2011Kare en affirmant que \u00ab [l]orsqu'ils sont utilis\u00e9s dans une loi, les mots qui ont une signification juridique bien d\u00e9finie devraient recevoir cette signification, sauf si le l\u00e9gislateur indique clairement autre chose \u00bb[1].\n[28] De plus, l'appelante invoque un passage de l'arr\u00eat Will-Kare concernant la Loi, o\u00f9 on affirme : \u00ab La nature technique de la Loi ne permet pas d'\u00e9largir le principe du sens ordinaire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober le sens courant[2]. \u00bb\n[29] L'appelante critique l'analyse \u00ab textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique \u00bb faite dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta. Elle affirme que l'inclusion des veufs et des veuves au concept d'\u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb d\u00e9coule d'une analyse textuelle trop large; on n'utilise le mot dans ce sens que m\u00e9taphoriquement, comme lors de fun\u00e9railles.\n[30] L'appelante critique \u00e9galement l'analyse contextuelle faite dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta parce qu'on n'a pas tenu compte du contexte de l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) lui\u2011m\u00eame. La disposition \u00e9largit le sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb dans une direction (c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire \u00e0 l'\u00e9poux suivant), mais, fait important, pas dans l'autre (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. \u00e0 l'ex\u2011\u00e9poux). Il s'agirait d'une indication de l'exclusion intentionnelle des personnes qui \u00e9taient \u00e9poux imm\u00e9diatement avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. les veufs et les veuves, soit la situation dans laquelle Mme Enns se trouvait.\n[31] L'appelante invoque aussi une d\u00e9claration de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Friesen c. Canada, [1995] 3 R.C.S. 103, par. 27 :\n[...] Selon un principe fondamental en mati\u00e8re d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois, un tribunal ne devrait pas accepter une interpr\u00e9tation qui n\u00e9cessite l'ajout de mots, lorsqu'il existe une autre interpr\u00e9tation acceptable qui ne requiert aucun ajout de cette nature. L'ajout de mots dans une d\u00e9finition qui figure dans une loi est encore moins acceptable lorsque les termes qui doivent \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s figurent dans plusieurs autres d\u00e9finitions de cette m\u00eame loi. [...]\n[32] Je crois comprendre que l'appelante invoque l'arr\u00eat Friesen pour critiquer la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, qui aurait ajout\u00e9 implicitement des mots de mani\u00e8re que le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) inclut les veufs et les veuves.\n[33] L'appelante s'appuie en outre sur une d\u00e9claration de la Cour supr\u00eame au paragraphe 41 de l'arr\u00eat Canada c. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 CSC 51 :\n[...] le caract\u00e8re singulier et pr\u00e9cis de nombreuses dispositions fiscales, de m\u00eame que le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Duke of Westminster [...] commandent de se concentrer attentivement sur le texte et le contexte de la loi pour cerner l'objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du r\u00e9gime [...] Cette m\u00e9thode est particuli\u00e8rement pertinente dans le cas qui nous occupe, o\u00f9 la disposition en cause fait partie du r\u00e9gime tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis du REATB. Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une affaire mettant en cause une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale anti-\u00e9vitement. La disposition en litige fait partie d'une exception \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab entreprise de placement \u00bb dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime tr\u00e8s complexe et d\u00e9fini du REATB. Pour que les contribuables sachent \u00e0 quoi s'en tenir dans un tel r\u00e9gime, il faut donner leur plein effet aux mots pr\u00e9cis et non \u00e9quivoques employ\u00e9s par le Parlement.\n[34] \u00c0 mon avis, cet extrait de l'arr\u00eat Loblaw n'est pas particuli\u00e8rement convaincant en l'esp\u00e8ce, dont la complexit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale ne se compare pas, comme c'est le cas dans l'arr\u00eat Loblaw, au \u00ab r\u00e9gime tr\u00e8s complexe et d\u00e9fini du REATB \u00bb.\n[35] L'appelante affirme que s'il faut \u00e9largir le sens du mot \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb, comme le voudrait l'intim\u00e9, il faut proc\u00e9der selon la voie l\u00e9gislative et non judiciaire. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9cision Kuchta cr\u00e9e une incertitude plus grande quant au sens du terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb utilis\u00e9 ailleurs dans la Loi, s'il faut appliquer une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique aux autres dispositions o\u00f9 figure le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb. Ce terme est utilis\u00e9 fr\u00e9quemment dans la Loi.\n[36] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, le juge Graham a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une analyse \u00e9toff\u00e9e, bien formul\u00e9e et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie sur la question de droit dont je suis saisi. La d\u00e9cision existe, avec son analyse compl\u00e8te, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e. Je ne suis pas d'avis que la possibilit\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 (et il ne me revient pas de d\u00e9cider si elle l'est) m'emp\u00eache d'en tenir compte.\n[37] M\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision Kuchta \u00e9tait frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9, elle existerait en soi. La d\u00e9cision, si elle \u00e9tait devenue nulle, n'aurait aucun effet juridique, m\u00eame si son annulation n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de l'analyse juridique du juge Graham.\n[38] Puisque la d\u00e9cision Kuchta est une d\u00e9cision de notre Cour qui porte sur la question de droit dont je suis saisi, je suis d'avis que je dois tenir compte du principe de la courtoisie judiciaire.\n[39] Le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire s'appliquerait dans mon examen d'une question de droit qu'un coll\u00e8gue de la Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 analys\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e.\n[40] Mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Boyle s'est prononc\u00e9 sur le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire aux paragraphes 22 et 25 de la d\u00e9cision Houda International Inc. c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 622 :\n22. Le principe du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent obligatoire ne s'applique pas aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par le tribunal d'une juridiction \u00e9quivalente. Cela dit, selon le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire, il faut faire preuve de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers la d\u00e9cision motiv\u00e9e par lui en l'absence de circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[...]\n25. Dans la d\u00e9cision Singh c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration), [1999] A.C.F. no 1008 (QL), no IMM\u20116546\u201198, 18 juin 1999 (C.F. 1re inst.), on lit les observations suivantes :\nDans la d\u00e9cision Glaxo Group Ltd. c. Canada (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le juge Richard (avant qu'il ne soit nomm\u00e9 juge en chef adjoint) a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir s'il \u00e9tait tenu, pour des motifs de courtoisie judiciaire, d'appliquer une d\u00e9cision du juge No\u00ebl (alors juge de premi\u00e8re instance) portant sur une question identique dont il \u00e9tait saisi. En examinant le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire et son application, le juge Richard a dit :\nLe principe de la courtoisie judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[traduction] Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que la pr\u00e9sente cour doit se conformer \u00e0 ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit possible de d\u00e9montrer que ces d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures \u00e9taient manifestement erron\u00e9es ou ne devraient plus \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es lorsque, par exemple, (1) la cour n'a pas tenu compte dans ses d\u00e9cisions de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ou de d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures qui auraient entra\u00een\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent ou (2), si elles sont suivies, la d\u00e9cision entra\u00eenerait une injustice grave. La raison qui est invoqu\u00e9e en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour justifier cette attitude est la courtoisie judiciaire. Bien qu'il s'agisse sans aucun doute d'une raison fondamentale justifiant une telle approche, je pense qu'il existe un motif tout aussi fondamental sinon plus imp\u00e9rieux et il s'agit de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une certaine certitude quant au sens de la loi, dans la mesure o\u00f9 celle\u2011ci peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie. La position des avocats serait intenable lorsqu'ils conseillent leurs clients si une section de la cour \u00e9tait libre de rendre sa d\u00e9cision sur un appel sans tenir compte d'une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure ou du principe qui y \u00e9tait en cause. [...]\nLe juge Jackett, pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, a adopt\u00e9 une position analogue dans l'affaire Canada Steamship Lines v. M.N.R., [1966] Ex. C.R. 972, \u00e0 la p. 976, [1966] C.T.C. 255, 66 D.T.C. 5205 :\n[traduction] Je crois que je suis oblig\u00e9 de suivre la m\u00eame d\u00e9marche que dans ces affaires puisqu'il s'agit d'un litige semblable tant que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, une d\u00e9marche diff\u00e9rente ne sera pas indiqu\u00e9e par une juridiction sup\u00e9rieure. Lorsque je dis que je suis oblig\u00e9, je ne veux pas dire que je suis oblig\u00e9 par quelque r\u00e8gle stricte d\u00e9coulant du stare decisis mais par ma propre opinion quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9sirabilit\u00e9 de voir la jurisprudence de notre juridiction suivre un cours aussi constant que possible.\nDans l'affaire R. v. Northern Electric Co. (1955), 24 C.P.R. 1, \u00e0 la p. 19, [1955] 3 D.L.R. 449, [1955] O.R. 431 (H.C.), le juge en chef McRuer a dit :\n[traduction] Compte tenu de tous les droits d'appel qui existent \u00e0 l'heure actuelle en Ontario, je pense que le juge Hogg a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le principe appropri\u00e9 de common law devant s'appliquer dans le jugement qu'il a rendu dans l'affaire R. ex rel. McWilliam v. Morris, [1942] O.W.N. 447, o\u00f9 il a dit : \u00ab Le principe du stare decisis est depuis longtemps reconnu dans notre droit. Sir Frederick Pollock affirme, dans son First Book of Jurisprudence, 6e \u00e9d., p. 312 : \u00ab Les d\u00e9cisions d'une cour sup\u00e9rieure ordinaire lient tous les tribunaux d'instance inf\u00e9rieure faisant partie de la m\u00eame juridiction et, bien qu'elles ne lient pas absolument les cours ayant une comp\u00e9tence connexe ni cette pr\u00e9sente cour elle-m\u00eame, elles seront suivies lorsqu'il n'y a aucune raison grave \u00e0 l'encontre d'un jugement \u00bb.\n\u00c0 mon avis, une raison grave \u00e0 l'encontre d'un jugement ne signifie pas un argument qui semble puissant aux yeux d'un juge en particulier mais quelque chose qui indique que la d\u00e9cision dont il s'agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sans tenir compte d'une loi ou d'un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre suivi. Je ne crois pas que l'on doive consid\u00e9rer qu'une raison est grave en ce sens simplement d'apr\u00e8s la mani\u00e8re de voir personnelle du juge. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[41] Tenant compte de ce conseil sur la courtoisie judiciaire, je conclus \u2014 que la d\u00e9cision Kuchta soit nulle ou non, et si elle l'est, que le principe de la courtoisie judiciaire s'applique ou non \u2014 qu'on ne peut dire que le juge, en faisant son analyse dans la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, n'a pas tenu compte \u00ab de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ou de d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures qui auraient entra\u00een\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent \u00bb. On ne peut non plus dire que si on suivait la d\u00e9cision Kuchta, cela entra\u00eenerait une \u00ab injustice grave \u00bb.\n[42] J'estime que l'avocat de l'appelante a bien plaid\u00e9 la cause de sa cliente, notamment en invoquant, comme j'en fais mention plus haut, plusieurs d\u00e9cisions importantes de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui militent en faveur d'une approche textuelle pour trancher la question de droit. N\u00e9anmoins, je crois que le juge Graham a appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit et en toute diligence l'analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco en interpr\u00e9tant le terme \u00ab \u00e9poux \u00bb \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 160(1)a) de la Loi.\n[43] Les principes directeurs que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco concernant l'application de cette analyse d'interpr\u00e9tation en trois volets sont reproduits plus haut, au paragraphe 13.

Question en litige\n[12] La seule question en litige devant la Cour consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les gains nets tir\u00e9s des activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker de Philippe D\u2019Auteuil doivent \u00eatre inclus dans le calcul de son revenu \u00e0 titre de revenu d\u2019une source qui est une entreprise en vertu des articles 3 et 9 de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008,2009, 2010, 2011 et 2012.\n[13] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, la question des gains nets tir\u00e9s des activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker de Philippe D\u2019Auteuil n\u2019est pas en litige devant cette Cour.\nIV. Th\u00e8ses des parties\nA. Position de l\u2019appelant\n[14] Selon l\u2019appelant, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si le poker est un jeu de hasard et de chance (pari) ou s\u2019il constitue un jeu d\u2019habilet\u00e9.\n[15] Si la Cour en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que le poker est un jeu de chance et de hasard, alors elle doit accueillir les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations sur la base de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f ) de la Loi.\n[16] Selon l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019identifier la source de revenu d\u2019un contribuable afin de d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on dont ce revenu sera trait\u00e9 pour fins fiscales.\n[17] Les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au jeu d\u2019un contribuable peuvent constituer un revenu imposable si elles constituent une source de revenus. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les gains provenant d\u2019un jeu de hasard ne sont pas imposables puisqu\u2019ils ne proviennent pas d\u2019une source de revenus.\n[18] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un contribuable constituent une source de revenus tir\u00e9s d\u2019une entreprise ou non, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart c. Canada, 2002 CSC 46 (\u00ab Stewart \u00bb) une approche \u00e0 deux volets.\n[19] Le premier consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019activit\u00e9 de poker est faite en vue de r\u00e9aliser un profit ou s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9marche personnelle. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 comporte un aspect personnel que cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape est pertinente car lorsque l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable n\u2019est aucunement personnelle, il y aura n\u00e9cessairement existence d\u2019une source de revenus au sens de la Loi.\n[20] Si l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable peut \u00e0 la fois \u00eatre un passe-temps et une entreprise, il faut alors se demander si cette activit\u00e9 est exploit\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re suffisamment commerciale, soit avec l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit \u00e9tay\u00e9 par une preuve objective d\u2019un comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux (par. 54 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart).\n[21] Lors de l\u2019analyse de cette intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit, il est important de prendre en consid\u00e9ration tous les faits entourant l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d\u2019un ensemble de facteurs. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldowan c. La Reine, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 480 (\u00ab Moldowan \u00bb), la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 les quatre crit\u00e8res suivants afin de d\u00e9terminer objectivement si un contribuable a une expectative raisonnable de profit :\na) l\u2019\u00e9tat des profits et des pertes pour les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures;\nb) la formation du contribuable;\nc) la voie sur laquelle le contribuable entend s\u2019engager; et\nd) la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit.\n[22] Ces crit\u00e8res ne constituent cependant pas une liste exhaustive des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer. Il faut d\u00e9terminer globalement si le contribuable exerce l\u2019activit\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re commerciale. La jurisprudence a notamment mis de l\u2019avant le crit\u00e8re de la minimisation du risque dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise par le contribuable. En effet, les tribunaux consid\u00e8rent que la prise de risque est une caract\u00e9ristique inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 toute activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice des revenus et que c\u2019est plut\u00f4t la minimisation du risque ou la gestion du risque qui est susceptible de faire de cette activit\u00e9 une source de revenus.\n[23] La simple recherche du profit ne suffit pas \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019un contribuable exploite une entreprise. L\u2019analyse de l\u2019ensemble des crit\u00e8res doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e dans le contexte sp\u00e9cifique du jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce car il est \u00e9vident que la totalit\u00e9 des joueurs ont l\u2019intention de faire un profit lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019adonnent \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s ou jeux.\n[24] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Cohen c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 262 (\u00ab Cohen \u00bb), il doit y avoir plus que le simple espoir ou d\u00e9sir de gagner. Une expectative planifi\u00e9e et raisonnable de r\u00e9aliser un profit doit exister. Les gains de jeu d\u2019un contribuable qui a l\u2019intention de gagner mais qui ne m\u00e8ne pas ses activit\u00e9s comme le ferait un homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux, ne seront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas imposables.\n[25] Le second volet de l\u2019approche d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart, \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si la source du revenu est celle d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien n\u2019a pas d\u2019application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce si l\u2019activit\u00e9 du contribuable ne repr\u00e9sente pas une d\u00e9marche personnelle et qu\u2019il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le contribuable avait l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit. L\u2019appelant admet qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait alors d\u2019un revenu d\u2019entreprise.\n[26] Selon les procureurs de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019application des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence aux faits particuliers de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9montre que :\na) Le poker est une activit\u00e9 \u00e0 caract\u00e8re personnel;\nb) les activit\u00e9s de poker de l\u2019appelant servaient uniquement \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des fonds pour des activit\u00e9s de loisirs et n\u2019avaient pas pour but de maximiser ses revenus;\nc) avant 2008, l\u2019appelant s\u2019adonnait au poker de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9cr\u00e9ative et amicale. L\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il a appris le poker en compagnie de son p\u00e8re avec du \u00ab faux argent \u00bb et avec des amis vers l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans. A sa majorit\u00e9, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est inscrit sur des sites Internet comme PartyPoker et PokerStars. Lorsque questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le poker si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en visionnant des films comme Rounders ou en consultant \u00e0 l\u2019occasion certain forums consacr\u00e9s au poker. En somme, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais suivi ou eu une formation particuli\u00e8re, pertinente et significative sur le jeu de poker;\nd) l\u2019appelant n\u2019entendait pas s\u2019engager sur la voie de jouer au poker comme s\u2019il exploitait une entreprise. L\u2019intention \u00e0 long terme de l\u2019appelant d\u2019exploiter une entreprise n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Au contraire, le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019int\u00e9ressait au monde des affaires. Au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9but\u00e9 un emploi aupr\u00e8s de monsieur Cl\u00e9ment Gagnon, un sp\u00e9cialiste en financement pour l\u2019entreprise CGE Capital Inc. En 2012, l\u2019appelant \u00e0 substantiellement diminu\u00e9 son temps consacr\u00e9 au jeu de poker et il s\u2019est inscrit \u00e0 un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9conomie \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval qu\u2019il a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 en 2020;\ne) le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il cherchait avant tout la comp\u00e9tition, l\u2019adr\u00e9naline, le \u00ab thrill \u00bb. L\u2019appelant mettait au d\u00e9fi des joueurs consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme tr\u00e8s bons \u00e0 jouer au t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate (heads-up en anglais), un jeu hautement risqu\u00e9 et o\u00f9 les mises sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9es. \u00c0 ce jeu, des dizaines de milliers de dollars peuvent \u00eatre perdues tr\u00e8s rapidement. Selon l\u2019appelant, ce comportement est risqu\u00e9, t\u00e9m\u00e9raire et tr\u00e8s irrationnel. Lorsqu\u2019il perd des sommes d\u2019argent importantes, l\u2019appelant tente de se refaire en jouant des parties \u00e0 hautes mises;\nf) l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune tenue de livre ou de comptabilit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune strat\u00e9gie pour d\u00e9velopper une entreprise viable, ni aucun plan d\u2019affaires. Le fait que les gains tir\u00e9s des activit\u00e9s de jeux de poker de l\u2019appelant repr\u00e9sentent sa principale ressource financi\u00e8re ne signifie aucunement qu\u2019il exploitait une entreprise. La situation de l\u2019appelant ressemblait davantage \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de jeu pathologique plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 un plan d\u2019affaires. Il ne faut pas confondre une d\u00e9pendance au jeu avec le comportement d\u2019un homme d\u2019affaires raisonnable ayant une expectative de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un profit;\ng) m\u00eame si l\u2019appelant a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 plus de gains que de pertes durant les ann\u00e9es en litige, sa capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit est impr\u00e9visible et instable. L\u2019appelant ne peut contr\u00f4ler le r\u00e9sultat des parties de poker parce que c\u2019est ultimement la chance qui d\u00e9termine qui r\u00e9alisera un gain ou subira une perte;\nh) l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas de comportement permettant la minimisation du risque. L\u2019appelant jouait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de tr\u00e8s hautes mises, souvent sous l\u2019influence de l\u2019alcool, parfois sous l\u2019influence de drogues et \u00e0 toute heure du jour et de la nuit. L\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les petites mises parce qu\u2019elles ne lui permettaient pas de ressentir le \u00ab thrill \u00bb si recherch\u00e9. Bien que divers sites Internet et logiciels soient disponibles afin de conna\u00eetre les statistiques des autres joueurs, l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il ne les a utilis\u00e9s que de fa\u00e7on marginale;\ni) l\u2019appelant ne choisissait pas ses opposants et il acc\u00e9dait aux tables disponibles. Il s\u2019adonnait \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 de multiples tables simultan\u00e9ment (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 tables en m\u00eame temps) \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 il en perdait le contr\u00f4le;\nj) le fait que l\u2019appelant jouait en ligne de mani\u00e8re fr\u00e9quente et pendant une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e ne fait preuve de rien. Le nombre et la fr\u00e9quence des parties sont davantage r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs d\u2019un comportement compulsif et d\u2019un trouble de d\u00e9pendance que de la commercialisation d\u2019une activit\u00e9.\n[27] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont soutenu que les jeux de hasard n\u2019ont pas les caract\u00e9ristiques inh\u00e9rentes essentielles \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination que l\u2019appelant exploitait une activit\u00e9 commerciale pouvant g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un revenu imposable.\n[28] Lors de l\u2019audience, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que peu de fiabilit\u00e9 et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es aux extraits que l\u2019on retrouve dans les divers forums et blogues disponibles en ligne sur internet. C\u2019est pour cette raison que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a retir\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de trois quarts des pi\u00e8ces au dossier de l\u2019appelant, lesquelles pi\u00e8ces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es aux fins de la r\u00e9daction du rapport de v\u00e9rification de l\u2019appelant et du rapport d\u2019expertise de monsieur Randal D. Heeb, docteur en \u00e9conomie, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au dossier de l\u2019appelant. Il est soumis que si les passages du rapport de v\u00e9rification et du rapport d\u2019expertise de monsieur Heeb qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux pi\u00e8ces retir\u00e9es et dont la preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite lors de l\u2019audition, le rapport de v\u00e9rification et le rapport d\u2019expertise seraient t\u00e9nus, voire factuellement infond\u00e9s.\n[29] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont attaqu\u00e9 le rapport de l\u2019expert Heeb retenu par l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur plusieurs fronts :\na) \u00e9tant docteur en \u00e9conomie, ce dernier ne poss\u00e8de pas les connaissances approfondies et la compr\u00e9hension pouss\u00e9e et tr\u00e8s technique que requiert une expertise math\u00e9matique et statistique afin de d\u00e9terminer avec un degr\u00e9 de certitude scientifique si le jeu de poker est un jeu de chance ou d\u2019habilet\u00e9;\nb) l\u2019expert Heeb mentionne avoir t\u00e9moign\u00e9 comme expert dans le cadre de cinq proc\u00e8s aux \u00c9tats-Unis et un proc\u00e8s au Canada (Cohen c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) 2015 CF 1192). Contrairement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019expert souhaite laisser croire, ses conclusions sur le jeu de poker n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es et encore moins avalis\u00e9es ou confirm\u00e9es par un tribunal au Canada. Par contre, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, un juge de premi\u00e8re instance a effectivement conclu que le poker est un jeu o\u00f9 les habilet\u00e9s pr\u00e9dominent sur la chance mais la Cour d\u2019appel dans la m\u00eame affaire a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance (voir United States v. Di Cristina, 12-3720 (726 F.3d 3292) et la Cour supr\u00eame des \u00c9tats-Unis a refus\u00e9 de se saisir de l\u2019appel formul\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur Di Cristina, mettant ainsi fin au d\u00e9bat;\nc) le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 celui d\u2019un t\u00e9moin de fait s\u2019auto qualifiant de joueur de poker professionnel plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 celui d\u2019un expert en \u00e9conomie impartial et ind\u00e9pendant. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019expert a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses propres habitudes de jeu, a inf\u00e9r\u00e9 des conclusions sur les comportements des joueurs alors qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas les qualifications requises pour ce faire et a formul\u00e9 des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sans aucune source \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Selon le t\u00e9moignage global de l\u2019expert, ce dernier ne pr\u00e9sente pas une opinion objective \u00e0 la Cour et il n\u2019a pas le degr\u00e9 requis d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 pour que son opinion et son expertise soient retenues.\n[30] Les procureurs de l\u2019appelant ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux rapports de contre-expertise. Un premier rapport de monsieur Mathieu Dufour, docteur en math\u00e9matiques ayant r\u00e9dig\u00e9 son th\u00e8se de doctorat sur la th\u00e9orie des jeux, visait \u00e0 analyser et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la part de hasard dans le r\u00e9sultat du jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em. Selon cet expert, deux conclusions s\u2019imposent :\na) l\u2019issue d\u2019une partie de poker d\u00e9pend manifestement \u00e0 la fois du hasard par la distribution des cartes et de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des joueurs;\nb) d\u00e9crivant la th\u00e9orie des jeux, la part du hasard et de chance pr\u00e9domine toujours sur la part d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Selon son analyse statistique des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019appelant, les r\u00e9sultats de ce dernier ne sont pas sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la moyenne.\n[31] L\u2019expert Dufour a \u00e9mis plusieurs critiques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des rapports de l\u2019expert Heeb, dont les suivants :\na) les tests effectu\u00e9s ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants;\nb) une erreur scientifique et logique est commise en ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il y a une partie d\u2019habilet\u00e9 dans le jeu de poker mais qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9montre pas que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 est pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante; et\nc) la \u00ab mesure de contribution d\u2019habilet\u00e9 \u00bb d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 aucun des crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une mesure statistique robuste et fiable.\n[32] Le deuxi\u00e8me rapport de contre-expertise est celui de monsieur Jeffrey Rosenthal, docteur en statistiques, lequel visait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la part de contribution de la chance et de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 dans le jeu de poker en ligne et de d\u00e9terminer si les tests statistiques effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019expert Heeb respectent les enseignements statistiques requis.\n[33] Cet expert a conclu avec certitude que les tests et analyses effectu\u00e9s par l\u2019expert Heeb ne permettent pas de d\u00e9terminer que les habilet\u00e9s pr\u00e9dominent sur la chance au poker. Selon lui, il est impossible de d\u00e9terminer le degr\u00e9 r\u00e9el que jouent la chance et l\u2019habilet\u00e9 au poker et qu\u2019il est ind\u00e9niable que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9domine pas sur la chance et ce, malgr\u00e9 des centaines de mains jou\u00e9es. Il r\u00e9fute d\u2019embl\u00e9e la conclusion tir\u00e9e par l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019apr\u00e8s seulement 3 000 mains, la chance est occult\u00e9e par les habilet\u00e9s.\nB. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[34] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne le sens tr\u00e8s large donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab entreprise \u00bb au paragraphe 248(1) de la Loi : sont compris parmi les entreprises, les professions, m\u00e9tiers, commerces, industries ou activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et [\u2026] les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial.\n[35] Selon l\u2019analyse de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cohen, lorsque les activit\u00e9s d\u2019un contribuable comportent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment personnel (comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent) la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si cette activit\u00e9 est exploit\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on suffisamment commerciale pour se qualifier d\u2019entreprise et \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une source de revenu aux fins de la Loi.\n[36] Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Stewart, 2002 CSC 46, pour qu\u2019une activit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de commerciale par nature, le contribuable doit avoir l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit. Cette d\u00e9termination doit se faire en fonction de facteurs objectifs et cette activit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des normes objectives de comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux.\n[37] La nature commerciale d\u2019une activit\u00e9 se caract\u00e9rise par l\u2019existence d\u2019un syst\u00e8me organis\u00e9 dans le but de g\u00e9rer ou d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les risques. L\u2019absence d\u2019un tel syst\u00e8me distingue un joueur inv\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un joueur professionnel (voir Balanko c. MNR, 81 DTC 887).\n[38] L\u2019application du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit aux causes de gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par le jeu ou les paris \u00ab consiste \u00e0 essayer de voir quel est l\u2019objectif dominant de la personne en cause, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019exploiter une entreprise ou de simplement se divertir \u00bb (voir MNR c. Mordern, 61 DTC 126 \u00e0 la page 1267).\n[39] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldovan, les facteurs objectifs suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit :\na) l\u2019\u00e9tat des profits et pertes des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures;\nb) la formation du contribuable;\nc) la voie sur laquelle il entendait s\u2019engager; et\nd) la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un profit.\n[40] La liste de facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moldovan n\u2019est pas exhaustive et d\u2019autres facteurs peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[41] L\u2019application de ces crit\u00e8res aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause d\u00e9montre que :\n\u00c9tats des profits et pertes des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures;\nselon le registre de jeu de l\u2019appelant sur le site de FullTiltPoker, l\u2019appelant avait, au 5 janvier 2008, dans son compte (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb) la somme de 160 654 $ et, selon son registre de jeu sur le site de PokerStars, l\u2019appelant avait, le 1er janvier 2008, dans son compte (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb) la somme de 166 731 $.\nl\u2019appelant est un autodidacte qui a appris \u00e0 jouer au poker avec son p\u00e8re. Il a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 des mains publi\u00e9es sur des forums et il a visionn\u00e9 des \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision diffusant des parties de poker sur le r\u00e9seau des sports TSN.\nselon le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant, ce dernier n\u2019avait pas de plan \u00e0 moyen et long terme mais il entendait continuer \u00e0 jouer tant qu\u2019il pourra avoir des gains lui permettant de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins. Il consacre un jeu de poker entre 10 et 30 heures par semaine et, entre 2008 et 2012, il n\u2019a eu qu\u2019un seul autre emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur, soit du 1er mai 2009 au 29 avril 2010 et dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fut de 16 000 $ en 2009 et de 8 000 $ en 2010.\nles gains que l\u2019appelant a tir\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s de poker sont de 867 688 $ en 2008, 305 661 $ en 2009, 1 410 320 $ en 2010, 1 920 558 $ en 2011 et de 736 948 $ en 2012;\nselon l\u2019expert Heeb, ces gains d\u00e9montrent un tr\u00e8s haut niveau d\u2019habilit\u00e9 et une expectative de profit par main de 0,91 c;\nselon la contre-expertise du professeur Rosenthal, l\u2019appelant a une probabilit\u00e9 de gain de 91,5% apr\u00e8s 92 653 mains.\nl\u2019appelant adapte son jeu en fonction des sommes d\u2019argent disponibles dans ses comptes (\u00ab bankroll \u00bb). A titre d\u2019exemple, au d\u00e9but de 2012, l\u2019appelant joue au tables des hautes mises suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des sommes gel\u00e9es dans son compte sur le site de FullTiltPoker et \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de gros gains \u00e0 la fin de 2011. En avril 2012, apr\u00e8s une s\u00e9rie de pertes, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est calm\u00e9 et a descendu le montant de ses mises parce qu\u2019il avait moins d\u2019argent dans ses comptes. Un autre exemple d\u2019adaptation du jeu de l\u2019appelant s\u2019est produit en 2008.

T\u00e9moignage de monsieur Philippe D\u2019Auteuil (pseudonyme \u00ab Takechips \u00bb)\n[43] Monsieur Philippe D\u2019Auteuil a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour expliquer d\u2019o\u00f9 est venu son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le poker et pour relater ses activit\u00e9s au cours des ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2012.\n[44] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer au poker en 2003 alors qu\u2019il avait 16 ans. Il jouait alors sur l\u2019internet avec son p\u00e8re en utilisant de l\u2019argent fictif. \u00c0 17 ans, il a jou\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re en utilisant de l\u2019argent v\u00e9ritable. Il habitait alors avec ses parents \u00e0 Rimouski.\n[45] En juillet 2006, il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec pour poursuivre ses \u00e9tudes \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval (baccalaur\u00e9at en administration). Il a ouvert alors son propre compte sur le site PartyPoker. Il demeurait alors en appartement avec deux de ses amis.\n[46] Il a dit, qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2006, il jouait au poker de 15 \u00e0 25 heures par semaine en plus de jouer \u00e0 des jeux vid\u00e9o en ligne (par exemple NHL). Il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 quitt\u00e9 l\u2019universit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a br\u00fbl\u00e9 le moteur de sa voiture lors d\u2019un voyage \u00e0 Chicoutimi.\n[47] En janvier 2007, il a fait un voyage en Europe avec Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re (un ami qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 Rimouski) et deux autres amis. Le voyage a dur\u00e9 deux \u00e0 trois mois et il a visit\u00e9 la France, l\u2019Espagne (Barcelone) et les Pays-Bas (Amsterdam). Au cours de ce voyage, il jouait au poker en ligne et il est initi\u00e9 aux drogues.\n[48] \u00c0 son retour de voyage, il a v\u00e9cu dans son appartement \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec avec des amis qui ne jouaient pas au poker. Il jouait au poker les apr\u00e8s-midi et le soir en utilisant son ordinateur portable. Comme il gagnait de l\u2019argent au poker, ses co- locataires et lui \u00e9taient toujours en f\u00eate.\n[49] En janvier 2008, il a effectu\u00e9 un voyage en Australie avec Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re et quatre autres amis et joueurs de poker. En deux mois, il dit avoir gagn\u00e9 170 000 $ en jouant une vingtaine d\u2019heures par semaine.\n[50] En juin 2008, il a acquis en co-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (40 %) avec Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re (60%) une r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Sainte-Foy au co\u00fbt de 525 000 $, pay\u00e9e par une traite bancaire obtenue sans financement. Deux autres co- locataires qui ne jouaient pas au poker habitaient \u00e9galement dans la r\u00e9sidence. L\u2019appelant et Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re avaient beaucoup d\u2019amis et de nombreuses festivit\u00e9s de piscine \u00e9taient organis\u00e9es \u00e0 leur r\u00e9sidence. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9crit son rythme de vie. Il se levait vers 11 heures, il commandait alors ses repas de restaurant, il jouait au poker de 15 \u00e0 20 heures par semaine et il fr\u00e9quentait des bars tous les soirs.\n[51] En octobre 2008, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 Londres pour participer \u00e0 deux tournois sur une p\u00e9riode de trois semaines. Chaque tournoi \u00e9tait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de cinq jours. Il a fini cinqui\u00e8me dans le deuxi\u00e8me tournoi et a gagn\u00e9 342 000 $.\n[52] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est rendu aux Bahamas pour participer \u00e0 un tournoi et, par la suite, il a fait plusieurs autres voyages dont le r\u00e9sultat net a \u00e9t\u00e9 de z\u00e9ro profit.\n[53] Au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, l\u2019appelant a occup\u00e9 un emploi aupr\u00e8s de CGE Capital Inc. et sa mission \u00e9tait d\u2019identifier des clients pour leur vendre des abris fiscaux dans le domaine minier. Il a occup\u00e9 cet emploi du 1er mai 2009 au 29 avril 2020 et il a gagn\u00e9 des revenus d\u2019emploi de 16 000 $ et de 8 000 $ provenant de CGE Capital Inc. pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009 et 2010 respectivement.\n[54] En 2010, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9but\u00e9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e aux Bahamas o\u00f9 il jouait \u00e0 des tables de 5 000 $ \u00e0 10 000 $. En mars et avril, il continuait de gagner et jouait \u00e0 des tables de 20 000 $ \u00e0 40 000 $. En 2010, l\u2019appelant a v\u00e9cu un grand stress caus\u00e9 par les difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res du site Hold\u2019em Poker. L\u2019appelant y avait alors un \u00ab bankroll \u00bb (i.e. l\u2019argent du compte de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 ce site) de 950 000 $. Le site a \u00e9t\u00e9 rachet\u00e9 par PokerStars et l\u2019appelant a pu r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la totalit\u00e9 de ses gains.\n[55] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 s\u2019il avait voyag\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada en 2011. L\u2019appelant a relat\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 400 000 $ en ao\u00fbt alors qu\u2019il jouait \u00e0 des tables de 100 000 $ \u00e0 200 000 $. \u00c0 la fin du mois d \u2019octobre, il a gagn\u00e9 la plus grosse cagnotte \u00e0 vie, soit 900 000 $ en tout.\n[56] Au d\u00e9but de 2012, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est rendu aux Bahamas. Il jouait beaucoup en ligne. En janvier et f\u00e9vrier, l\u2019appelant a gagn\u00e9 700 000 $ mais il a perdu 800 000 $ en mars et avril et 150 000 $ en fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[57] De 2008 \u00e0 2012, l\u2019appelant a accumul\u00e9 beaucoup d\u2019argent et n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019une autre source de revenus. Il jouait de hautes mises et il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019obligations familiales. Il a accept\u00e9 un emploi chez GCE Capital Inc. par int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le domaine financier. En 2012, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est inscrit \u00e0 des cours afin d\u2019obtenir un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9conomie.\n[58] De 2008 \u00e0 2012, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 avoir jou\u00e9 environ 20 heures par semaine en 2008 et en 2009 et environ 15 heures par semaine aux cours des ann\u00e9es 2010, 2011 et 2012. Son nombre d\u2019heures de jeu, selon lui, est bas\u00e9 sur le nombre de mains qu\u2019il a jou\u00e9 au cours de ces ann\u00e9es.\n[59] Lors du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 que le nombre d\u2019heures de jeu des joueurs de poker est enregistr\u00e9 par les sites de poker. Les fichiers renferment les heures de jeu des tables de tous les jours et toutes les transactions r\u00e9alis\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une journ\u00e9e par chaque joueur. Le \u00ab bankroll \u00bb des joueurs y appara\u00eet \u00e9galement.\n[60] Lors de la v\u00e9rification, l\u2019ARC a obtenu les registres du jeu de PokerStars pour toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010. Les informations obtenues de PokerStars ne contiennent pas d\u2019informations concernant le nombre de mains jou\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque table. Par contre, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu qu\u2019un joueur qui joue sur huit tables \u00e0 la fois peut jouer 1 000 mains par heure. Selon l\u2019appelant, la r\u00e8gle serait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une main par minute par table de six joueurs.\n[61] Toujours lors du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait ressortir les nombreux transferts d\u2019argent entre joueurs de poker et a longuement questionn\u00e9 l\u2019appelant au sujet de ces transferts. L\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait souvent de pr\u00eats ou de remboursement de dettes et qu\u2019il tenait un registre des pr\u00eats consentis aux autres joueurs si un pr\u00eat n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rapidement rembours\u00e9. Selon l\u2019appelant, la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des transferts d\u2019argent sont reli\u00e9s au poker.\n[62] Lors du contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019appelant, il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019une entrevue accord\u00e9e sur MSN lors de son voyage en Australie et aux \u00eeles Fiji o\u00f9 il a connu beaucoup de succ\u00e8s et d\u2019un livre publi\u00e9 par un monsieur Simon Gravel dans lequel il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant aimait d\u00e9fier ses adversaires et qu\u2019il aimait jouer contre les joueurs les plus forts avec de plus grosses mises.\n[63] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 concernant son utilisation du logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager qui fournit des statistiques sur les joueurs de poker. L\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 avoir fait l\u2019acquisition de ce logiciel en 2009 suite \u00e0 une longue s\u00e9quence de pertes et que sa motivation principale \u00e9tait de suivre ses propres r\u00e9sultats, compte tenu du nombre de mains jou\u00e9es. L\u2019appelant a dit qu\u2019il a peu consult\u00e9 ce logiciel pour conna\u00eetre les statistiques de ses adversaires.\n[64] En fin de t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 ce que les termes \u00ab Stake \u00bb et \u00ab Rakeback \u00bb signifiaient. Le terme \u00ab Stake \u00bb r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019achat de parts dans la participation d\u2019un joueur qui joue dans un tournoi en pr\u00e9sentiel. Cela permet au joueur de partager son risque, soit principalement le co\u00fbt d\u2019inscription au tournoi. Naturellement, si le joueur gagne, il doit partager une partie de ses gains. Le \u00ab Rakeback \u00bb est la partie des frais pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s par les sites du jeu sur chaque pot qui est rembours\u00e9e aux joueurs afin de les fid\u00e9liser. Les frais pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s par les sites de jeux et la partie remboursable de ces frais varient d\u2019un site \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\n[65] L\u2019appelant prend souvent des \u00ab Stake \u00bb dans les gros tournois de Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re.\nVI.

Il est un expert en \u00e9valuation d\u2019entreprise et il d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en administration des affaires et un certificat en comptabilit\u00e9, C.G.A., C.B.V. et E.E.E.\n[67] Le rapport de v\u00e9rification en date du 20 septembre 2013 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve et les faits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s sauf pour ce qui est des conclusions tir\u00e9es des extraits de divers forums et blogues disponibles en ligne sur internet qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve par l\u2019intim\u00e9. La p\u00e9riode de v\u00e9rification couvre les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008 \u00e0 2012.\n[68] L\u2019appelant a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 un questionnaire sur ses habitudes de jeu au d\u00e9but de la v\u00e9rification mais une entrevue initiale avec l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pu \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e parce que son repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019alors s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 une telle rencontre et \u00e0 toute communication directe avec l\u2019appelant.\n[69] Selon les informations fournies par l\u2019appelant, il exerce principalement ses activit\u00e9s sur les sites de poker en ligne suivants : PokerStars, FullTiltPoker, PartyPoker et Ultimatebet. Il participe \u00e9galement \u00e0 des tournois de poker en personne dont les World Series of Poker \u00e0 Las Vegas, les PokerStars Caribbean Adventure aux Bahamas et le PokerStars EPT \u00e0 Londres.\n[70] Dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification, l\u2019appelant a fourni les registres pour deux des quatre sites importants sur lesquels il participe \u00e0 des parties de poker en ligne, soit les sites de FullTiltPoker et PokerStars. Les habitudes de jeu de l\u2019appelant et les gains tir\u00e9s de ses activit\u00e9s de poker ont pu \u00eatre \u00e9tablis \u00e0 partir des registres des deux des quatre sites importants sur lesquels l\u2019appelant participe \u00e0 des parties de poker en ligne et \u00e0 partir des registres bancaires personnels de l\u2019appelant. Seuls les montants qui sont connus, fiables et certains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9s.\n[71] Le v\u00e9rificateur a expliqu\u00e9, qu\u2019\u00e0 partir des registres des sites de FullTiltPoker et de PokerStars, il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9chantillonnage de trois mois par ann\u00e9e pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2011 afin d\u2019identifier les habitudes de jeux de l\u2019appelant. Il ressort de cette analyse que l\u2019appelant participe \u00e0 des parties de poker en ligne pour environ 93 heures par mois et pour pr\u00e8s de 22 heures par semaine. De plus, lorsque l\u2019appelant d\u00e9bute une session, il joue en moyenne trois heures et 45 minutes et joue sur environ sept tables en m\u00eame temps. L\u2019appelant r\u00e9alise en moyenne un profit de 72 193 $ mensuellement.\n[72] L\u2019analyse des registres de FullTiltPoker et de PokerStars r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019appelant fr\u00e9quente les sites de poker en ligne de fa\u00e7on quasi quotidienne et qu\u2019il a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un des deux sites de jeux, souvent les deux, pour 289 jours, 261 jours, 292 jours et 255 jours respectivement au cours des ann\u00e9es 2008, 2009, 2010 et 2011, soit une moyenne de 274 jours par ann\u00e9e. Au cours de cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9poser plus de 5 millions de dollars dans ses comptes bancaires personnels.\n[73] Les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts r\u00e9alis\u00e9s dans les comptes bancaires de l\u2019appelant proviennent principalement des sites de poker en ligne, tels que PokerStars et PartyPoker, et sont des gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s lors de tournois de poker en personne et aussi des ch\u00e8ques d\u2019autres joueurs de poker dont Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re. La r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 et l\u2019importance des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts li\u00e9s au poker d\u00e9montrent que le poker est la principale source de revenus de l\u2019appelant.\n[74] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode de v\u00e9rification, l\u2019appelant a occup\u00e9 un emploi pendant une ann\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de CGE Capital Inc. en tant que charg\u00e9 de comptes. L\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis \u00e0 un horaire fixe et pouvait exercer ses fonctions quand bon lui semblait. Les relev\u00e9s T4 de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es 2009 et 2010 affichent respectivement des montants de 16 000 $ et 8 000 $ provenant de CGE Capital Inc. Ce revenu est le seul revenu de l\u2019appelant ne provenant pas de ses activit\u00e9s de poker au cours de la p\u00e9riode v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e.\n[75] L\u2019analyse des relev\u00e9s de carte de cr\u00e9dit RBC Banque Royale de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, m\u00eame lorsque l\u2019appelant se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du pays en voyage, celui-ci a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 les sites de jeu en ligne pratiquement \u00e0 tous les jours de son voyage.\n[76] M\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il ne joue pas, l\u2019appelant consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps aux activit\u00e9s de poker. Pour demeurer comp\u00e9titif, l\u2019appelant s\u2019informe des tendances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du poker en ligne; il revoit et analyse des mains auxquelles il a particip\u00e9 et il \u00e9coute des \u00e9missions consacr\u00e9es au poker. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 environ deux heures par semaine le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute des \u00e9missions li\u00e9es au domaine du poker. Toujours afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son jeu, l\u2019appelant a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises une somme de 155.55 $ \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise Poker Analytics Services pour l\u2019abonnement \u00e0 un site de poker en ligne qui fournit des services de consultation, d\u2019apprentissage et de d\u00e9veloppement du jeu de poker.\n[77] L \u2019appelant a confirm\u00e9 avoir utilis\u00e9 le logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager lorsqu\u2019il joue au poker en ligne. Ce logiciel sert, entre autres choses, \u00e0 conserver ses statistiques de jeux, son historique de jeux et de nombreuses autres donn\u00e9es pertinentes \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de poker. M\u00eame si l\u2019appelant a mentionn\u00e9 dans sa correspondance du 13 mai 2013 qu\u2019il allait fournir les statistiques contenues dans ce logiciel, lesdites statistiques n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par l\u2019appelant.\n[78] Le logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager conserve \u00e9galement des informations sur les joueurs contre qui l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9, ce qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de mieux r\u00e9agir lorsqu\u2019il les affronte \u00e0 nouveau. \u00c0 l\u2019aide de ce logiciel, l\u2019appelant est en mesure d\u2019identifier certains joueurs contre lesquels il lui est plus profitable de jouer et d\u2019autres qu\u2019il vaut mieux \u00e9viter.\nVII.

L\u2019\u00e9tude la plus int\u00e9ressante est celle men\u00e9e en 2019 par des experts en informatique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Carnegie Mellon qui a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Pluribus, une cr\u00e9ature d\u2019intelligence artificielle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de battre un groupe d\u2019\u00e9lite de cinq joueurs professionnels \u00e0 une table de six joueurs jouant au Texas Hold\u2019em sans limite via internet. L\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019une s\u00e9quence de 10 000 mains a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Pluribus a nettement domin\u00e9 les joueurs professionnels.\n[84] L\u2019expert Heeb a produit un second rapport dat\u00e9 du 8 septembre 2020 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un mandat de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer si l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une grande habilet\u00e9 au poker (si possible, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel degr\u00e9) et si les gains de poker obtenus par l\u2019appelant au cours des ann\u00e9es 2009, 2010 et 2011 correspondaient \u00e0 son niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Pour r\u00e9aliser son mandat, l\u2019expert a consult\u00e9 ses rapports en relation avec l\u2019affaire Di Cristina et des documents publics dont le livre de Simon Gravel intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Les Ma\u00eetres du poker \u00bb, des entrevues, des extraits de forums de discussions et plusieurs autres documents et vid\u00e9os sur internet et des donn\u00e9es de HandHQ concernant des mises de 0,50 \u00a2\/1 $ jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 $\/20 $.\n[85] Selon les donn\u00e9es de HandHQ, l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9 92,653 mains en ne tenant compte que de son jeu aux mises 10 $\/ 20 $ et a gagn\u00e9 84 299 $ pour une moyenne de 0,91 c par main au cours de la p\u00e9riode du mois d\u2019avril 2010 au mois de mars 2011. L\u2019expert Heeb a compar\u00e9 ces r\u00e9sultats avec ceux de trois groupes de comparaison, soit la \u00ab population totale \u00bb qui comprend l\u2019ensemble des joueurs, les \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb qui comprend tous les joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 moins de 1 000 mains et la moiti\u00e9 des joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 plus de 1 000 mains, et les \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb qui comprend la moiti\u00e9 des joueurs qui ont jou\u00e9 plus de 1 000 mains mais qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb et qui ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 un profit par main, sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moyenne dans leur premier deux-tiers de mains. La cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb repr\u00e9sentait 90.8 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 10 $\/20 $ et 88.8 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 5 $\/10 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb repr\u00e9sentaient 9.2 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 10 $\/20 $ et 11.2 % des joueurs ayant jou\u00e9 aux parties 5 $\/10 $.\n[86] Les comparaisons entre les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019appelant et ceux des diff\u00e9rents groupes de joueurs effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019expert Heeb lui ont permis de conclure que :\napr\u00e8s 92 653 mains, la moyenne des r\u00e9sultats par main jou\u00e9e pour les joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie de la \u00ab population totale \u00bb est n\u00e9gative \u00e0 0,18 \u00a2 par main;\nl\u2019appelant \u00e0 une grande probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9sultats plus profitables apr\u00e8s 92 653 mains qu\u2019un joueur faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie de la \u00ab population totale \u00bb;\nsur une base annuelle, 37.5 % des joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb, qui jouent le m\u00eame nombre de mains et avec le m\u00eame m\u00e9lange de parties aux mises 5 $\/10 $ et 10 $\/20 $ que les parties jou\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant, ont une expectative d\u2019obtenir un profit et les joueurs les plus habiles de cette cat\u00e9gorie sont capables de gagner r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et de gagner leur vie en jouant au poker;\napr\u00e8s 92 653 mains, les joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb ont 93.14 % plus de probabilit\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats que les \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb;\nl\u2019appelant est un joueur tr\u00e8s habile dont les r\u00e9sultats de profit par main dominent non seulement les joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb mais \u00e9galement la plupart des joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb;\nles joueurs faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb ont une expectative de profit n\u00e9gative \u00e0 0.99 \u00a2 par main alors que l\u2019appelant \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat r\u00e9el positif de 0.91 \u00a2 par main, ce qui place l\u2019appelant \u00e0 un percentile de 99.99 % des joueurs de cette cat\u00e9gorie pour les r\u00e9sultats anticip\u00e9s de profit. Un joueur de cette cat\u00e9gorie n\u2019a que 0.01 % de chance de gagner autant que l\u2019appelant apr\u00e8s 58 946 mains, soit quatre joueurs sur 10 000 joueurs de cette cat\u00e9gorie;\npar rapport aux joueurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs tr\u00e8s habiles \u00bb, l\u2019appelant se situe dans le 95i\u00e8me percentile des joueurs en terme de gains.\n[87] L\u2019expert retenu par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement produit un rapport de contre-expertise dat\u00e9 du 25 novembre 2020 suite au rapport du professeur Jeffrey Rosenthal, un des deux experts retenus par l\u2019appelant. Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision du rapport du professeur Rosenthal, l\u2019expert Heeb a maintenu les opinons qu\u2019il a rendues dans ses deux rapports pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Selon lui, le poker est un jeu o\u00f9 la contribution de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 des joueurs pr\u00e9domine sur la contribution du facteur chance dans la d\u00e9termination des r\u00e9sultats des parties. L\u2019expert a, de plus, r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un tr\u00e8s habile joueur de poker car il se situe dans le percentile 98.16 % des gains par main des joueurs faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie de la \u00ab population totale \u00bb et dans le percentile 99.99 % des joueurs faisant partie de la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00ab joueurs r\u00e9cr\u00e9atifs \u00bb.\n[88] L\u2019expert Heeb a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait une probabilit\u00e9 de 91.5 % de gagner la moyenne le salaire annuel d\u2019un entrepreneur am\u00e9ricain de 50 000 $ am\u00e9ricains et qu\u2019il avait une probabilit\u00e9 de 99.8 % de gagner un profit net annuel en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il s\u2019adonne au poker \u00e0 plein temps.\n[89] Le 14 juillet 2021, l\u2019expert Heeb a produit un autre rapport de contre-expertise au rapport du Dr. Mathieu Dufour, un des deux experts retenus par l\u2019appelant. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait une r\u00e9vision exhaustive du rapport du Dr. Dufour, l\u2019expert Heeb a maintenu toujours que le poker est un jeu d\u2019habilet\u00e9 en ce sens que la contribution du facteur habilet\u00e9 est plus important que la contribution du facteur chance dans la d\u00e9termination des r\u00e9sultats au poker. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du Dr. Dufour, l\u2019expert Heeb est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant est un joueur tr\u00e8s habile et que le succ\u00e8s financier substantiel et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier en jouant du poker est compatible avec son haut niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9.\n[90] L\u2019expert Heeb a en premier lieu, abord\u00e9 et r\u00e9fut\u00e9 les trois principaux points de d\u00e9saccord soulev\u00e9s par le Dr. Dufour, \u00e0 savoir que :\nles diff\u00e9rents crit\u00e8res d\u2019habilet\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants;\nles crit\u00e8res et les analyses propos\u00e9s sont des crit\u00e8res pour d\u00e9terminer si le degr\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 au poker est plus grand que z\u00e9ro, et non pour d\u00e9terminer si la contribution de l\u2019habilet\u00e9 est plus grande que la contribution du facteur chance;\nla mesure du degr\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 manque d\u2019un indice de confiance (i.e. une marge d\u2019erreur), n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9finition non ambig\u00fce, ne mesure pas le concept d\u00e9sir\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 et ne g\u00e9n\u00e8re pas de r\u00e9sultat constant.\n[91] Par la suite, l\u2019expert a clarifi\u00e9 des points qui portaient \u00e0 confusion dont le crit\u00e8re d\u2019habilet\u00e9, le calcul du nombre de mains jou\u00e9es et le rythme de jeu d\u2019un joueur de poker professionnel qui joue en ligne. Concernant ce dernier point, l\u2019expert Heeb a discut\u00e9 de trois sources possibles de confusion.\n[92] La premi\u00e8re source de confusion concerne le nombre de parties jou\u00e9es en personne par des professionnels. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, le rythme de jeu en personne d\u2019un professionnel est environ de 30 mains par heure, soit 300 mains par session quotidienne de dix heures par session et 1 500 mains pour une semaine de 50 heures alors que les joueurs professionnels en ligne vont normalement jouer 50 mains \u00e0 l\u2019heure, et ce, pour chaque table \u00e0 laquelle ils jouent.\n[93] La seconde source de confusion concerne le nombre de tables auxquelles un joueur peut jouer en ligne simultan\u00e9ment. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, les joueurs exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s peuvent facilement jouer \u00e0 quatre tables \u00e0 la fois et certains joueurs peuvent m\u00eame jouer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 tables et plus en m\u00eame temps. Un joueur qui joue \u00e0 quatre tables simultan\u00e9ment pendant dix heures par jour et cinq jours par semaine aura jouer 10 000 mains dans une semaine (soit 50 mains \u00e0 l\u2019heure x 4 tables x 10 heures par jour x 5 jours par semaine).\n[94] La troisi\u00e8me source de confusion concerne le rythme de jeu annuel de l\u2019appelant parce que les experts se concentrent uniquement sur les donn\u00e9es obtenues de HandHQ, qui r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 une seule suite de jeu (PokerStars) et seulement pour les mises de 0.50 \u00a2\/1 $ \u00e0 10 $\/20 $ et pour une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois se terminant en mars 2011. Dans le cas de l\u2019appelant, seulement 92 653 mains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en compte alors qu\u2019il a reconnu avoir jou\u00e9 intens\u00e9ment sur au moins deux autres sites, soit sur Full Tilt Pocker et PartyPoker. Par cons\u00e9quent, le nombre de mains jou\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte ne repr\u00e9sente qu\u2019une infime partie du nombre de mains r\u00e9ellement jou\u00e9es dans une ann\u00e9e.\n[95] L\u2019expert Heeb a apport\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions concernant le taux de commission exig\u00e9 par le site PokerStars (le \u00ab rake \u00bb) parce que le Dr. Dufour a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que ce taux \u00e9tait de 5 % des mises. Selon l\u2019expert Heeb, ce taux est incorrect et a pour effet de biaiser substantiellement l\u2019impact du \u00ab rake \u00bb. Le taux r\u00e9el du \u00ab rake \u00bb exig\u00e9 par le site PokerStars est d\u2019environ 5% jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un maximum de 3 $ pour les mises de 5 $\/10 $ et de 10 $\/20 $. Lorsque le pot d\u2019une partie atteint 60 $, il n\u2019y a pas de \u00ab rake \u00bb additionnel. L\u2019effet du \u00ab rake \u00bb par main par joueur pour la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les donn\u00e9es de PokerStars sont disponibles est de 0.18 \u00a2 par main par joueur pour les mises de 10 $\/20 $ et de 0.16 \u00a2 par main par joueur pour les mises de 5 $\/10 $.\nVIII. Expertises pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant\n[96] Un premier expert mandat\u00e9 par le procureur de l\u2019appelant est monsieur Jeffrey S. Rosenthal, lequel d\u00e9tient un BSc en math\u00e9matiques et physique et en science informatique de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto (1988) et un doctorat en math\u00e9matiques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Harvard (1992). Depuis 1993, il est professeur de statistiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto.\n[97] Son mandat consistait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les contributions relatives du facteur habilet\u00e9 et du facteur chance des joueurs de poker en ligne et, en particulier de r\u00e9viser et commenter les diff\u00e9rents rapports et conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb dans le cadre du litige de l\u2019appelant avec l\u2019ARC. Le professeur Rosenthal a produit un rapport dat\u00e9 du 19 octobre 2020 et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Pour ex\u00e9cuter son mandat, le professeur Rosenthal a eu acc\u00e8s aux diff\u00e9rents rapports de l\u2019expert Heeb dans la cause Di Cristina et dans la cause de l\u2019appelant et de celles de messieurs Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re et Antoine B\u00e9rub\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des dossiers financiers et \u00e0 des courriels concernant les gains et les pertes de l\u2019appelant r\u00e9sultant de son jeu en ligne et aux donn\u00e9es d\u00e9taill\u00e9es portant sur les 187 millions de parties jou\u00e9es en ligne sur le site de PokerStars au cours de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019avril 2020 \u00e0 mars 2011.\n[98] Essentiellement, la position du professeur Rosenthal est que les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant est un joueur extr\u00eamement habile et que cette habilet\u00e9 domine grandement sur le facteur chance apr\u00e8s quelques milliers de mains ne sont pas ad\u00e9quatement d\u00e9montr\u00e9es et sont m\u00eames contredites par les r\u00e9sultats r\u00e9els obtenus par l\u2019appelant, lesquels montrent des probabilit\u00e9s significatives de pertes et de longues p\u00e9riodes de pertes substantielles.\n[99] Le professeur Rosenthal a observ\u00e9 une circularit\u00e9 dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019expert Heeb en ce sens que les joueurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s dans diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories et \u00e9valu\u00e9s en utilisant les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. La m\u00eame chose s\u2019est produite afin de mesurer les statistiques du mod\u00e8le de paris et les gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au poker.\n[100] Dans le cas particulier de l\u2019appelant, le professeur Rosenthal a observ\u00e9 que son pourcentage d\u2019habilet\u00e9, calcul\u00e9 selon la formule de l\u2019expert Heeb, \u00e9tait estim\u00e9 \u00eatre 0 %, de 45.5 % (sur une base mensuelle), de 33.3 % (sur une base des profits nets annuels) et de 82.9 % des profits annuels totaux pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient disponibles, l\u2019appelant a connu une longue p\u00e9riode de pertes ce qui n\u2019est pas conforme aux mod\u00e8les de gains con\u00e7us par l\u2019expert Heeb pour les joueurs les plus habiles. Au niveau recommand\u00e9 de 3 000 mains, le pourcentage d\u2019habilet\u00e9 estim\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant n\u2019exc\u00e8de pas 19.4 %.\n[101] Le deuxi\u00e8me expert mandat\u00e9 par le procureur de l\u2019appelant est le Dr. Matthieu Dufour lequel d\u00e9tient un doctorat en math\u00e9matiques de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et est un associ\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des actuaires. Monsieur Dufour est depuis 2001 professeur d\u2019actuariat au D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et il a publi\u00e9 plusieurs articles sur la th\u00e9orie des jeux.\n[102] Son mandat, \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert ind\u00e9pendant en math\u00e9matiques, en th\u00e9orie des jeux, en th\u00e9orie des probabilit\u00e9s et en action actuariat, \u00e9tait d\u2019analyser et de d\u00e9terminer la part du hasard dans le r\u00e9sultat du jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em et d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il est possible d\u2019y jouer avec une esp\u00e9rance de gain positive \u00e0 long terme.\n[103] Le professeur Dufour a produit un rapport dat\u00e9 11 juin 2021 de m\u00eame qu\u2019une r\u00e9plique dat\u00e9e du 11 ao\u00fbt 2021 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 son rapport. Pour ex\u00e9cuter son mandat, le professeur Dufour a eu acc\u00e8s aux avis d\u2019appel et aux r\u00e9ponses aux avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019appelant et \u00e0 tous les rapports d\u2019expertise produits par l\u2019expert Heeb et par le professeur Rosenthal dans le dossier de l\u2019appelant.\n[104] Le professeur Dufour a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Son t\u00e9moignage et son rapport ont fait ressortir trois principaux points de d\u00e9saccord avec les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb. Ces points de d\u00e9saccord sont les suivants :\n- les crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019expert Heeb ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendants et ils constituent tous des variations d\u2019un seul et m\u00eame crit\u00e8re, i.e., la constatation qu\u2019en moyenne, les meilleurs joueurs de son \u00e9chantillon font mieux que les moins bons. L\u2019habilit\u00e9 des joueurs peut justifier une certaine part de leurs succ\u00e8s, mais la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019expert Heeb au moyen de ses graphiques, est erron\u00e9e, car les m\u00eames types de graphiques sont obtenus avec des r\u00e9sultats purement al\u00e9atoires pour lesquels seul le hasard est en cause;\n- en aucun moment, l\u2019expert Heeb a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019habilit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante sur la chance au poker;\n- \u00ab la mesure de contribution de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb d\u2019un joueur de poker, telle qu\u2019\u00e9labor\u00e9e par l\u2019expert Heeb, ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 aucun des crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une mesure statistique robuste et fiable, \u00e0 savoir une d\u00e9finition non ambig\u00fce, l\u2019existence d\u2019un intervalle de confiance (marge d\u2019erreur), une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 mesurer la chose voulue et une coh\u00e9rence dans les r\u00e9sultats (valeurs n\u00e9gatives);\n- le professeur Dufour a \u00e9galement conclu que l\u2019analyse des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019appelant pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019avril 2010 \u00e0 mars 2011 de 0.91 \u00a2 par main lui procure une probabilit\u00e9 a priori de terminer l\u2019ann\u00e9e avec au moins le gain qu\u2019il a obtenu n\u2019est que de 8.5 %, ce qui est absolument non remarquable et ne ressort nullement de la moyenne;\n- dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019expert Heeb, le professeur Dufour a notamment trait\u00e9 des questions suivantes :\n- la confusion entourant les conclusions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que \u00ab Il y a au poker de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb (conclusion courte) et \u00ab Au poker, l\u2019habilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9domine \u00bb (conclusion erron\u00e9e);\n- le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la \u00ab mesure d\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb; et\n- la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un joueur aguerri \u00e0 tirer parti des faiblesses de ses adversaires dans le jeu en ligne.\n[105] Concernant la \u00ab pr\u00e9dominance de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb, le professeur Dufour a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019expert Heeb n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la signification de cette notion.\n[106] Concernant le crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la \u00ab mesure d\u2019habilit\u00e9 \u00bb, le professeur Dufour a soutenu que ce test ne respecte pas les standards minimums de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 pour un test statistique, notamment \u00e0 cause de l\u2019absence de toute mesure d\u2019intervalle de confiance qui viendrait valider ce test.\n[107] Concernant la capacit\u00e9 pour un joueur aguerri \u00e0 tirer parti des faiblesses de ses adversaires dans le jeu en ligne, le professeur Dufour a affirm\u00e9, en se basant sur les th\u00e9or\u00e8mes math\u00e9matiques de la th\u00e9orie des jeux, que la chance \u00e9tait largement dominante dans le succ\u00e8s d\u2019un joueur et que, pour cette raison, il faut un grand nombre de mains pour qu\u2019un joueur beaucoup plus fort qu\u2019un autre finisse par l\u2019emporter de fa\u00e7on convaincante. Selon lui, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait un talent particulier qui lui permettait de d\u00e9tecter si ses adversaires en ligne bluffaient ou non.\nIX. Les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables\n[108] Les dispositions de la Loi applicables au pr\u00e9sent litige sont l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3a), le paragraphe 9(1), l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) et le paragraphe 248(1).\n[109] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 3a) pr\u00e9voit que, dans le calcul de son revenu, le contribuable doit inclure le revenu provenant d\u2019une source au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, y compris le revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise. Le paragraphe 9(1) pr\u00e9voit que le revenu que le contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) pr\u00e9voit que le gain ou la perte d\u2019un contribuable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition d\u2019une chance de gagner un prix ou un pari ou d\u2019un droit de recevoir une somme comme prix ou comme enjeu d\u2019un pari est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre nul. Le paragraphe 248(1) pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab entreprise \u00bb comprend les professions de m\u00eame que les activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial.\n[110] Ces dispositions de la Loi se lisent comme suit :\nRevenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition\n3 Pour d\u00e9terminer le revenu d\u2019un contribuable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, les calculs suivants sont \u00e0 effectuer :\na) le calcul du total des sommes qui constituent chacune le revenu du contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e (autre qu\u2019un gain en capital imposable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition d\u2019un bien) dont la source se situe au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, y compris, sans que soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le revenu tir\u00e9 de chaque charge, emploi, entreprise et bien;\nRevenu\n9 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente partie, le revenu qu\u2019un contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e.\nPerte\n(2) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 31, la perte subie par un contribuable au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition relativement \u00e0 une entreprise ou \u00e0 un bien est le montant de sa perte subie au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 cette entreprise ou \u00e0 ce bien, calcul\u00e9e par l\u2019application, avec les adaptations n\u00e9cessaires, des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi aff\u00e9rentes au calcul du revenu tir\u00e9 de cette entreprise ou de ce bien.\n[\u2026]\n40(2) f) est nul le gain ou la perte du contribuable r\u00e9sultant de la disposition :\n(i) soit d\u2019une chance de gagner un prix ou un pari,\n(ii) soit d\u2019un droit de recevoir une somme comme prix ou comme enjeu d\u2019un pari,\n\u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une loterie ou d\u2019un pari collectif mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 205 du Code criminel;\n[\u2026]\n248(1) entreprise Sont compris parmi les entreprises les professions, m\u00e9tiers, commerces, industries ou activit\u00e9s de quelque genre que ce soit et, sauf pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(2)c), de l\u2019article 54.2, du paragraphe 95(1) et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 110.6(14)f), les projets comportant un risque ou les affaires de caract\u00e8re commercial, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion toutefois d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi. (business)\nX. Analyse et conclusion\n[111] Il ne fait aucun doute que le jeu de poker de type Texas Hold\u2019em sans limite est un jeu de hasard et d\u2019habilet\u00e9. Les experts retenus par les parties s\u2019entendent sur ce point. Le d\u00e9saccord entre les experts porte essentiellement sur les conclusions de l\u2019expert Heeb \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019habilet\u00e9 pr\u00e9vaut sur le hasard.\n[112] Cette question, quoique tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante, n\u2019est pas vraiment pertinente pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant exploitait ou non une entreprise au cours des ann\u00e9es en litige, parce que, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelant, le poker n\u2019est pas un jeu de type \u00ab pari \u00bb vis\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40(2)f) de la Loi. Le droit de recevoir une somme comme enjeu d\u2019un pari n\u2019est pas gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une loterie ou d\u2019un pari collectif mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 205 du code criminel. Mentionnons ici que l\u2019article 205 du code criminel a par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli par la loi de 1985, L.R. ch. 52 (1er suppl.) a.1, sanctionn\u00e9 le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1985.\n[113] D\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les parties s\u2019entendent sur les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 utiliser pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant exploitait ou non une entreprise (voir les paragraphes 18 \u00e0 25 et les paragraphes 35 \u00e0 40). Leurs divergences proviennent de l\u2019application de ces crit\u00e8res aux faits qui sont propres \u00e0 l\u2019appelant.\n[114] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 et 2012, les activit\u00e9s de poker de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient beaucoup plus qu\u2019un divertissement. Il jouait au poker pour gagner sa vie; en ce sens, il \u00e9tait un joueur de poker professionnel. Il jouait au poker de fa\u00e7on non r\u00e9cr\u00e9ative dans le but de d\u00e9gager un profit. Il organisait sa vie en fonction du poker. Il jouait m\u00eame en vacances et il payait ses voyages avec ses gains de poker.\n[115] Les activit\u00e9s de jeu de poker de l\u2019appelant repr\u00e9sentaient sa principale source de revenus au cours des ann\u00e9es en litige. Sa seule autre source de revenus \u00e9tait des revenus d\u2019emploi de 16 000 $ et 8 000 $ provenant de CGE Capital Inc. pour les ann\u00e9es 2009 et 2010.\n[116] Selon le rapport de v\u00e9rification, la conciliation des gains totaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant uniquement sur les sites PokerStars et FullTiltPoker, lorsqu\u2019ajout\u00e9s aux d\u00e9p\u00f4ts effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du site PartyPoker et des gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s en tournois, d\u00e9montre que les revenus r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant sont au minimum de 5 241 025 $ pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2012.\n[117] Dans les faits, l\u2019appelant consacrait la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de son temps au jeu de poker. L\u2019analyse des registres de FullTiltPoker et de PokerStars a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant fr\u00e9quentait les sites du poker en ligne de fa\u00e7on quasi-quotidienne et qu\u2019il a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 un des deux sites de jeu, souvent les deux sites, pour 289 jours, 261 jours, 292 jours et 255 jours respectivement au cours des ann\u00e9es 2008, 2009, 2010 et 2011, soit une moyenne de 274 jours par ann\u00e9e.\n[118] En plus de ses heures de jeu, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 2 heures par semaine le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute d\u2019\u00e9missions t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelles et autres consacr\u00e9es au poker dans le but de demeurer comp\u00e9titif et de s\u2019informer des tendances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du poker en ligne. Afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son jeu, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est abonn\u00e9 \u00e0 un site de l\u2019entreprise Poker Analytics Services qui fournit des services de consultations, d\u2019apprentissage et de d\u00e9veloppement du jeu de Poker.\n[119] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 avoir utiliser la logiciel Hold\u2019em Manager lorsqu\u2019il joue au poker en ligne. Ce logiciel sert \u00e0 conserver ses statistiques de jeux, son historique de jeux et de nombreuses autres donn\u00e9es pertinentes \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de poker, en plus de fournir des informations concernant les joueurs contre qui l\u2019appelant a jou\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019aide de ce logiciel, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019identifier des joueurs contre qui il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de ne pas jouer et ceux contre qui il lui \u00e9tait plus profitable de jouer.\n[120] Malgr\u00e9 son mode de vie hors norme et sa propension \u00e0 toujours vouloir jouer aux tables de tr\u00e8s hautes mises, l\u2019appelant avait un comportement d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux. Il jouait au poker pour gagner. Il \u00e9vitait de jouer contre certains adversaires et il adaptait son jeu en fonction de son \u00ab bankroll \u00bb pour \u00e9viter les situations trop p\u00e9rilleuses. L\u2019appelant a adopt\u00e9 des normes objectives de gestion et de minimisation des risques. Lorsqu\u2019il participait \u00e0 des tournois en pr\u00e9sentiel, il partageait et vendait \u00e0 d\u2019autres joueurs des parts en fonction des co\u00fbts d\u2019entr\u00e9e aux tournois. Il lui arrivait aussi de prendre des participations dans les tournois auxquels Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re participait pour les montants entre 100 000 $ et 150 000 $.\n[121] A l\u2019aide de ses gains de poker, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire l\u2019acquisition de deux immobilisations importantes, \u00e0 savoir une r\u00e9sidence acquise en 2008 en copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 (40 %) avec M. Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re pour un co\u00fbt total de 525 000 $, pay\u00e9 comptant de m\u00eame qu\u2019un v\u00e9hicule automobile pour un co\u00fbt de 37 500 $ aussi pay\u00e9 comptant.\n[122] L\u2019appelant r\u00e9investissait \u00e9galement une partie de ses gains dans le poker en prenant des participations dans des tournois auxquels M. Martin Fournier Gigu\u00e8re participait. Ce genre d\u2019op\u00e9rations permettait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de diversifier ses investissements et de maximiser ses possibilit\u00e9s de revenus.\n[123] A ce niveau de gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant sur une aussi longue p\u00e9riode de temps, je suis convaincu que l\u2019appelant pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 pouvoir gagner sa vie en jouant au poker et m\u00eame de faire une carri\u00e8re de joueur professionnel.\n[124] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je viens \u00e0 la conclusion que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019appelant avait l\u2019intention subjective de r\u00e9aliser un profit en s\u2019adonnant \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s de poker et qu\u2019il utilisait son expertise et sur habilit\u00e9 pour gagner sa vie au poker, un jeu de hasard o\u00f9 l\u2019habilit\u00e9 entre fortement en ligne de compte.\n[125] Pour toutes ces raisons, (a) l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la nouvelle cotisation en date du 1er novembre 2013 concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2008 est rejet\u00e9 sans frais, et (b) les appels \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations en date du 1er novembre 2013 concernant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010, 2011 et 2012 sont accueillis en partie, sans frais, et lesdites cotisations sont d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la ministre du Revenu national pour nouvel examen et nouvelles cotisations afin de (1) diminuer le revenu imposable de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2009, 2010 et 2011 d\u2019un montant de 305 661 $, 3 550 $ et 1 684 $ respectivement; et (2) d\u2019accorder une perte d\u2019entreprise de 215 781 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2012.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, ce 25e jour de janvier 2023.\n\u00ab R\u00e9al Favreau \u00bb\nJuge Favreau\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 3\nN\u00ba DES DOSSIERS DE LA COUR :\n2014-90 (IT)G\n2014-1171(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nPhilippe D\u2019Auteuil et SMR\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nQu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLes 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22 et 23 septembre 2021\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL'honorable juge R\u00e9al Favreau\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 25 janvier 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats de l\u2019appelant :\nMe Danny Galarneau\nMe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Dupuis\nAvocats de l'intim\u00e9e :\nMe Gr\u00e9goire Cadieux\nMe Sonia B\u00e9dard\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant:\nNom :\nMe Danny Galarneau\nMe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Dupuis\nCabinet :\nCain Lamarre (SENCRL)\nFasken Martineau DuMoulin (SENCRL)\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle\nSous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

Aper\u00e7u\nLes pr\u00e9sents appels sont interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des d\u00e9cisions rendues par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) au titre du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (le \u00ab RPC \u00bb) et de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (la \u00ab LAI \u00bb), selon lesquelles M. Swinden, l\u2019intervenant dans les pr\u00e9sents appels (l\u2019\u00ab intervenant \u00bb), a occup\u00e9 un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension chez All Sports Marketing Inc. (\u00ab All Sports Marketing \u00bb ou l\u2019\u00ab appelante \u00bb) durant la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er janvier 2017 au 11 juillet 2017 (la \u00ab p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00bb).\nII. Faits\nJ\u2019ai entendu deux t\u00e9moins : M. Swinden, qui souscrit \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination faite par le ministre, et M. Donato, qui ne l\u2019est pas.\nM. Donato a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en premier. Il est le fondateur et l\u2019actionnaire d\u2019All Sports Marketing. All Sports Marketing fournit des services de marketing num\u00e9riques cibl\u00e9s \u00e0 des organisateurs d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements sportifs ext\u00e9rieurs, comme des marathons.\nPage : 2\nCes \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont souvent organis\u00e9s pour amasser des fonds au profit d\u2019\u0153uvres de bienfaisance.\nAll Sports Marketing utilise le courrier \u00e9lectronique et les m\u00e9dias sociaux pour faire la promotion des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. M. Donato a affirm\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il est \u00e9galement propri\u00e9taire et fondateur de Good Times Running Inc., un organisme de planification d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui poss\u00e8de et exploite trois \u00e9v\u00e9nements sportifs \u00e0 Toronto.\nM. Donato a insist\u00e9 pour dire que l\u2019intervenant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. L\u2019intervenant pouvait d\u00e9terminer comment et quand il fournissait des services \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Il pouvait travailler depuis la maison, un caf\u00e9 ou sa voiture. Le mode de prestation des services offerts par l\u2019intervenant n\u2019avait aucune importance. Seuls les r\u00e9sultats rev\u00eataient une importance pour M. Donato. Selon M. Donato, c\u2019est pour cette raison que l\u2019intervenant \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 pour ses services selon une structure de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 commission.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapidement \u00e9tabli que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Donato ne concordait pas avec l\u2019entente qu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9e et conclue avec l\u2019intervenant au nom de l\u2019appelante en novembre 2015 (l\u2019\u00ab entente \u00bb). M. Donato a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 argumenter quand l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 ce fait au cours de son contre-interrogatoire. J\u2019attache peu de valeur \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage pour les motifs qui suivent.\nCe qui ressort \u00e0 la lecture de chacune des clauses de l\u2019entente, c\u2019est qu\u2019il s\u2019apparente \u00e0 un contrat de travail. Notamment, l\u2019entente est d\u00e9finie comme un contrat de travail. L\u2019appelante est appel\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019employeur \u00bb, et l\u2019intervenant est appel\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019entrepreneur \u00bb, m\u00eame s\u2019il est aussi parfois appel\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00bb.\nPar exemple, l\u2019article 3 du pr\u00e9ambule est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction] [L]\u2019employeur souhaite employer l\u2019entrepreneur et l\u2019employ\u00e9 convient d\u2019accepter cet emploi selon les modalit\u00e9s et conditions \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019entente.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nL\u2019article 2 de l\u2019entente dispose que l\u2019intervenant a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour fournir ses services \u00e0 temps plein.\nPage : 3\nL\u2019article 4 de l\u2019entente est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction] L\u2019employeur accepte d\u2019employer l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant des ventes, et l\u2019entrepreneur accepte de travailler selon les modalit\u00e9s et conditions \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019entente. L\u2019entrepreneur accepte de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une supervision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et d\u2019agir conform\u00e9ment aux ordres, avis et directives de l\u2019employeur.\nDe m\u00eame, l\u2019article 6 de l\u2019entente est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction] L\u2019entrepreneur accepte de se conformer aux r\u00e8gles, r\u00e8glements et pratiques de l\u2019employeur, y compris en ce qui concerne les horaires de travail, les vacances et les cong\u00e9s de maladie, qui pourront de temps \u00e0 autre \u00eatre adopt\u00e9s ou modifi\u00e9s.\nL\u2019article 5 pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit :\n[traduction] L\u2019entrepreneur ex\u00e9cutera toutes les t\u00e2ches confi\u00e9es maintenant et plus tard \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur par l\u2019employeur.\nCes t\u00e2ches consistent notamment \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser des ventes pour des parties li\u00e9es ou des noms de domaine appartenant directement ou indirectement \u00e0 M. Donato, comme MyNextRace.com, RoadRaceResults.com et Good Times Running Inc.\nL\u2019article 10 du contrat prescrit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] L\u2019employeur remboursera l\u2019entrepreneur pour toutes les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires engag\u00e9es par l\u2019employ\u00e9 durant un d\u00e9placement, conform\u00e9ment aux directives et \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de l\u2019employeur.\nIl y a d\u2019autres dispositions qui sont incompatibles avec un contrat d\u2019entreprise. Par exemple, l\u2019article 15 prescrit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] L\u2019entrepreneur accepte de se consacrer \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 ses t\u00e2ches \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur de l\u2019employeur.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une clause qu\u2019accepterait une personne fournissant des services \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nDe m\u00eame, les articles 16 et 17, qui figurent sous l\u2019en-t\u00eate [traduction] \u00ab Pour \u00e9viter les conflits relatifs aux occasions d\u2019affaires \u00bb, ne sont pas des clauses qu\u2019accepterait une personne travaillant \u00e0 son compte. Ces clauses pr\u00e9cisent que toute occasion d\u2019affaires li\u00e9e ou semblable aux occasions d\u2019affaires actuelles ou futures de l\u2019employeur appartient \u00e0 l\u2019employeur.\nPage : 4\nL\u2019intervenant ne pouvait poursuivre de telles occasions d\u2019affaires sans le consentement \u00e9crit de l\u2019appelante.\nL\u2019impression que j\u2019ai, c\u2019est que M. Donato a utilis\u00e9 un contrat de travail en guise de mod\u00e8le pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019entente. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, j\u2019en d\u00e9duis que M. Donato a simplement remplac\u00e9 le mot [traduction] \u00ab employ\u00e9 \u00bb par le mot [traduction] \u00ab entrepreneur \u00bb, sans modifier l\u2019essentiel du contrat d\u2019emploi, qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9 comme mod\u00e8le pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019entente.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019utilisation du mot [traduction] \u00ab entrepreneur \u00bb en remplacement du mot [traduction] \u00ab employ\u00e9 \u00bb semble n\u2019\u00eatre qu\u2019une fa\u00e7ade inefficace.\nIII. Analyse\nIl peut \u00eatre difficile de distinguer un emploi d\u2019une entente conclue avec un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, parce que les relations de travail font l\u2019objet de modifications constantes. La distinction se r\u00e9sume aux d\u00e9finitions suivantes d\u2019un \u00ab emploi \u00bb :\na) L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) de la LAI donne la d\u00e9finition suivante :\nl\u2019emploi exerc\u00e9 au Canada pour un ou plusieurs employeurs, aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services ou d\u2019apprentissage expr\u00e8s ou tacite, \u00e9crit ou verbal, que l\u2019employ\u00e9 re\u00e7oive sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019employeur ou d\u2019une autre personne et que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit calcul\u00e9e soit au temps ou aux pi\u00e8ces, soit en partie au temps et en partie aux pi\u00e8ces, soit de toute autre mani\u00e8re[.]\nb) Le paragraphe 2(1) du RPC est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nemploi L\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu par un contrat de louage de services ou d\u2019apprentissage, expr\u00e8s ou tacite, y compris la p\u00e9riode d\u2019occupation d\u2019une fonction.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat de principe sur cette question est l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.R.N.1, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc.2. La question est toujours de savoir si oui ou non la personne engag\u00e9e \u00ab pour fournir les services les fournit en tant que personne travaillant \u00e0 son compte \u00bb3. L\u2019arr\u00eat Sagaz r\u00e9sume le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n1 [1986] 3 CF 553.\n2 2001 CSC 59, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 983.\n3 Ibid, par. 47.\nPage : 5\n[...] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il faut toujours prendre en consid\u00e9ration le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le que l\u2019employeur exerce sur les activit\u00e9s du travailleur. Cependant, il faut aussi se demander, notamment, si le travailleur fournit son propre outillage, s\u2019il engage lui-m\u00eame ses assistants, quelle est l\u2019\u00e9tendue de ses risques financiers, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point il est responsable des mises de fonds et de la gestion et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point il peut tirer profit de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches.\nCes facteurs, il est bon de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, ne sont pas exhaustifs et il n\u2019y a pas de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie de les appliquer. Leur importance relative respective d\u00e9pend des circonstances et des faits particuliers de l\u2019affaire4.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nToutefois, il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que l\u2019intention des parties est \u00e9galement pertinente dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle transpara\u00eet dans les faits de l\u2019affaire. L\u2019intention exprim\u00e9e par les parties n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante en ce qui concerne la question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le juge Mainville de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a apport\u00e9 la pr\u00e9cision suivante dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) c. Canada (Revenu National)5 :\n[37] [...] La situation juridique d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant ou d\u2019employ\u00e9 ne se d\u00e9termine donc pas seulement sur la base de l\u2019intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e des parties. Cette d\u00e9termination doit aussi se fonder sur une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective et v\u00e9rifiable.\nCet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 refl\u00e8te un raisonnement juridique logique. Dans certains cas, en particulier lorsque des nouveaux-venus sur le march\u00e9 du travail ou des employ\u00e9s peu qualifi\u00e9s sont en cause, il existe souvent une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans les pouvoirs de n\u00e9gociation. Une personne \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi pourra devoir faire face \u00e0 une n\u00e9gociation contractuelle men\u00e9e selon l\u2019approche \u00ab \u00e0 prendre ou \u00e0 laisser \u00bb.\nLes \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe. J\u2019approuve l\u2019observation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur ce point par l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie finale. M. Donato, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019appelante, a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 tirer avantage de deux situations tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019appelante exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le financier sur l\u2019intervenant, en plus de contr\u00f4ler ses faits et gestes, selon les modalit\u00e9s et conditions r\u00e9elles de son emploi \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019entente. De l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une contestation et d\u2019une d\u00e9termination contraire, l\u2019appelante pouvait \u00e9viter les co\u00fbts des cotisations obligatoires au RPC et \u00e0 l\u2019assurance-emploi, ainsi que des avantages sociaux obligatoires et autres avantages pr\u00e9vus par la loi.\n4 Ibid, par. 47 et 48.\n5 2013 CAF 85.\nPage : 6\nAfin d\u2019\u00e9viter toute situation comme celles d\u00e9crites ci-dessus, l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes propose une analyse obligatoire en deux \u00e9tapes. D\u2019abord, l\u2019intention des parties doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie, dans le but de d\u00e9terminer le type de relation qu\u2019elles souhaitent cr\u00e9er. Compte tenu de cette intention, la seconde \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 analyser les faits de l\u2019affaire pour d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective confirme l\u2019intention subjective des parties. Cet examen a pour but de d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non le travailleur engag\u00e9 \u00ab pour fournir les services les fournit en tant que personne travaillant \u00e0 son compte \u00bb. Dans cette seconde \u00e9tape, la Cour doit appliquer les facteurs suivants \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door, soit (i) le contr\u00f4le, (ii) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des instruments, (iii) les possibilit\u00e9s de profit et (iv) les risques de pertes, pour d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des faits confirme l\u2019intention subjective des parties.\nM. Donato a insist\u00e9 pour dire que M. Swinden \u00e9tait d\u2019accord pour fournir ses services \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur. Pour aider l\u2019intervenant \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations fiscales, M. Donato lui a conseill\u00e9 de consulter le conseiller fiscal externe de l\u2019appelante, qui lui a indiqu\u00e9 comment facturer ses services \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et produire ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nIl ne fait aucun doute que M. Donato est un vendeur efficace et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9. Je d\u00e9duis d\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que M. Swinden a accept\u00e9 de signer l\u2019entente sans obtenir un avis juridique ind\u00e9pendant, en agissant uniquement sur la base des d\u00e9clarations de M. Donato concernant les avantages dont l\u2019intervenant pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nJe me demande si M. Donato a re\u00e7u des conseils fiscaux ind\u00e9pendants relativement aux avantages et aux inconv\u00e9nients d\u2019une relation d\u2019emploi par rapport \u00e0 une relation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. Il ne fait aucun doute que le conseiller fiscal de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait conscient du fait que l\u2019appelante souhaitait \u00e9viter les co\u00fbts des cotisations et autres avantages sociaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 un emploi. J\u2019en d\u00e9duis que le seul conseil que l\u2019intervenant a re\u00e7u concernait la fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9clarer ses revenus \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et de pr\u00e9lever la TVH au besoin.\nIl est justifi\u00e9 de formuler une derni\u00e8re observation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La question de savoir si l\u2019intervenant a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire des d\u00e9penses qui n\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles que s\u2019il se qualifiait comme entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant n\u2019a aucune incidence sur l\u2019issue du pr\u00e9sent appel, puisque je ne suis pas saisi de cette question. En outre, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)f) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu dispose qu\u2019un vendeur qui a re\u00e7u des commissions peut d\u00e9duire les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 son emploi si les conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la disposition sont satisfaites. Dans de nombreux cas, les d\u00e9penses qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9duites aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)f) sont semblables \u00e0 celles que peuvent d\u00e9duire les personnes travaillant \u00e0 leur compte dans une situation similaire.\nPage : 7\nComme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, m\u00eame si le terme [traduction] \u00ab entrepreneur \u00bb est utilis\u00e9 dans l\u2019entente pour d\u00e9signer la relation avec l\u2019intervenant comme \u00e9tant une relation avec un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, l\u2019essentiel de l\u2019entente est inconciliable avec cette d\u00e9signation. Les modalit\u00e9s et conditions que l\u2019intervenant a accept\u00e9es sont typiquement pr\u00e9sentes dans un contrat de louage de services et non dans un contrat d\u2019entreprise.\nJe reviens maintenant aux facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door dont je fais mention pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n(1) Contr\u00f4le\nDans un contexte o\u00f9 il faut \u00e9tablir la distinction entre des employ\u00e9s et des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants, le contr\u00f4le est souvent d\u00e9fini comme la capacit\u00e9 ou le droit d\u2019un payeur d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur la fa\u00e7on dont un travailleur s\u2019acquitte de ses t\u00e2ches. Plus le payeur exerce un contr\u00f4le important sur son personnel, plus la relation se rapproche de celle liant un employeur et un employ\u00e9. De m\u00eame, plus le travailleur est libre d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ses t\u00e2ches comme il le souhaite, plus il semble travailler \u00e0 son compte.\nComme je le souligne pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je conclus que l\u2019entente permettait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le financier sur l\u2019intervenant, en plus de contr\u00f4ler ses faits et gestes. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Swinden confirme que les parties interagissaient selon les modalit\u00e9s et conditions de leur entente. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ajouter quoi que ce soit pour ce facteur.\n(2) Instruments de travail\nLes \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent que M. Swinden travaillait sur place 75 p. cent du temps. Il utilisait la papeterie de l\u2019entreprise au besoin. Il imprimait \u00e9galement la documentation sur l\u2019imprimante de l\u2019entreprise. Il avait acc\u00e8s aux renseignements cumul\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante sur les clients actuels, avec qui il communiquait pour faire de la sollicitation.\nM. Swinden a reconnu qu\u2019il utilisait son propre ordinateur portatif, son propre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et sa propre voiture dans l\u2019exercice de ses t\u00e2ches. On lui remboursait ses d\u00e9penses d\u2019essence et autres quand il se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait pour accomplir ses t\u00e2ches.\nPage : 8\nTout bien pes\u00e9, ce facteur a un poids neutre.\n(3) Possibilit\u00e9 de profit\/risque de perte\nM. Swinden devait s\u2019acquitter personnellement des t\u00e2ches qui lui incombaient. Contrairement \u00e0 un vendeur ind\u00e9pendant, il ne pouvait confier ses t\u00e2ches en sous-traitance \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e0 ses propres frais, dans l\u2019espoir d\u2019accro\u00eetre ses revenus tir\u00e9s de commissions.\nM. Donato a affirm\u00e9 que M. Swinden assumait un risque de perte. L\u2019absence de ventes signifiait l\u2019absence de revenus de commissions. M\u00eame si cela est vrai dans une certaine mesure, le risque de perte de M. Swinden \u00e9tait substantiellement att\u00e9nu\u00e9 par son droit \u00e0 un salaire de base de 20 $ l\u2019heure pour une semaine de 40 heures.\nM. Donato a affirm\u00e9 que M. Swinden avait plus d\u2019un client. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019article 4 de l\u2019entente dispose que les t\u00e2ches de M. Swinden consistaient notamment \u00e0 vendre des services pour All Sports Marketing, MyNextRace.com, RoadRaceResults.com et Good Times Running Inc. Comme je l\u2019indique plus t\u00f4t, ces noms de domaine et ces entit\u00e9s appartiennent \u00e0 M. Donato. Si M. Swinden \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, je pense qu\u2019il aurait conserv\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir ses propres clients. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019offrir ses services \u00e0 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 temps plein.\n\u00c0 mon avis, ce facteur indique un contrat de louage de services.\nIV. Conclusion\n\u00c0 mon avis, les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les arr\u00eats Wiebe Door et Sagaz penchent en faveur d\u2019une conclusion selon laquelle M. Swinden \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective de la situation est que l\u2019appelante exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le sur la mani\u00e8re dont M. Swinden fournissait ses services de m\u00eame que sur le moment o\u00f9 il le faisait. Pour ces motifs, je rejette les appels et confirme la d\u00e9cision du ministre selon laquelle M. Swinden \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante aux fins du RPC et de la LAI pour la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 16e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Robert J.

Bruno Oliveira, enseignant au niveau secondaire \u00e0 Kelowna, en Colombie-Britannique, demande \u00e0 la Cour de rendre des ordonnances prorogeant le d\u00e9lai d\u2019introduction des appels interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations fond\u00e9es sur la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise. Son avocat affirme que toutes les conditions requises pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une telle prorogation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies. L\u2019avocate de la Couronne affirme que ce n\u2019est pas le cas.\n[2] Le 30 septembre 2019, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb) a \u00e9tabli une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Oliveira en tant qu\u2019administrateur d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 num\u00e9ro en application de l\u2019article 227.1 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019article 323 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise. M. Oliveira affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 administrateur de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[3] M. Oliveira a contest\u00e9 les cotisations en s\u2019opposant \u00e0 chacune d\u2019entre elles. Il a fait le suivi de nombreuses communications avec la Division des appels de l\u2019ARC et a trait\u00e9 avec plusieurs fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC en vue d\u2019obtenir l\u2019annulation des cotisations.\n[4] La Division des appels de l\u2019ARC a finalement termin\u00e9 son examen et a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oliveira des avis de confirmation des cotisations. L\u2019ARC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas annuler les cotisations comme M. Oliveira l\u2019avait demand\u00e9.\n[5] La prochaine \u00e9tape pour M. Oliveira, telle qu\u2019elle lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite par l\u2019ARC dans les avis de confirmation, \u00e9tait d\u2019interjeter appel devant notre Cour dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pr\u00e9vu par la loi. Les deux avis font express\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai.\n[6] Toutefois, m\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9, la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise pr\u00e9voient toutes deux un d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pour demander \u00e0 la Cour de rendre une ordonnance prorogeant le d\u00e9lai d\u2019introduction d\u2019un appel. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9galement pas respect\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai, je dois rejeter les demandes de M. Oliveira.\nDispositions l\u00e9gislatives\n[7] La Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise autorisent l\u2019introduction d\u2019un appel aupr\u00e8s de notre Cour dans les 90 jours suivant l\u2019envoi par l\u2019ARC d\u2019un avis de confirmation de la cotisation. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un avis de confirmation est envoy\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la Division des appels de l\u2019ARC a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019opposition d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. C\u2019est exactement ce qui s\u2019est produit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] Si l\u2019appel n\u2019est pas introduit dans ces 90 jours, une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel peut \u00eatre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 notre Cour si la demande est introduite dans un d\u00e9lai de un an \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9lai de 90 jours. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une demande au cours de cette ann\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire, mais pas suffisant, pour que notre Cour fasse droit \u00e0 la demande.\n[9] Si la demande est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui suit le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, la Cour doit alors d\u00e9terminer si toutes les autres conditions pr\u00e9vues par la loi sont remplies, \u00e0 savoir :\n(a)dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, le demandeur (i) n\u2019a pas pu agir ou charger quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre d\u2019agir pour lui, ou (ii) avait de bonne foi l\u2019intention d\u2019interjeter appel;\n(b)il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 la demande;\n(c)la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient;\n(d)l\u2019appel est raisonnablement fond\u00e9.\n[10] Il incombe au demandeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que chaque condition est remplie[1].\n[11] La condition la plus importante est le respect du d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9sentation de la demande, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 305(5)a) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise. Les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu sont reproduites \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb et les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise sont reproduites \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab B \u00bb.\n[12] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que M. Oliveira n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 les ordonnances dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les autres conditions pr\u00e9vues par la loi.\nConclusions de fait\n[13] En ce qui concerne les cotisations au titre de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, la Couronne a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit de M. Steve Kos, employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC. Ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019ARC avait confirm\u00e9 les cotisations au moyen d\u2019un avis de confirmation dat\u00e9 du 10 mai 2021[2] et a joint une copie de l\u2019avis de confirmation \u00e0 son affidavit. L\u2019avis est dat\u00e9 du 10 mai 2021[3]. Cet avis informait M. Oliveira que son opposition \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e et que les cotisations \u00e9taient confirm\u00e9es. Il informait \u00e9galement M. Oliveira de ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 169 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9cision, vous pouvez interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019avis de confirmation.

Cheung a post\u00e9 l\u2019avis lui-m\u00eame et a d\u00e9crit les \u00e9tapes qu\u2019il a suivies pour ce faire. Il a \u00e9galement assur\u00e9 le suivi de la livraison \u00e0 M. Oliveira, qui a eu lieu le 17 mai 2021[5]. M. Cheung a joint une copie de l\u2019avis de confirmation qui informait M. Oliveira de la confirmation de la cotisation. Il informait \u00e9galement M. Oliveira de ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 306 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9cision, vous pouvez interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019avis de confirmation. Pour savoir comment interjeter appel, consultez la publication RC4443-3, Proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t visant les cotisations de TPS\/TVH, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse suivante : canada.ca\/cra-publication-rc4443-3.

Oliveira a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour qu\u2019il avait lu les avis de confirmation originaux alors qu\u2019il se trouvait dans la salle de bains. Alors qu\u2019il lisait les avis, il a d\u00fb quitter brusquement la pi\u00e8ce. Par la suite, la salle de bains a \u00e9t\u00e9 inond\u00e9e. L\u2019inondation ayant d\u00e9truit les avis de confirmation originaux, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division des appels de l\u2019ARC de lui en fournir d\u2019autres. L\u2019ARC les a fournis avec une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 ao\u00fbt 2021[6].\n[16] Bien que M. Oliveira ne se souvienne pas de la date \u00e0 laquelle il a re\u00e7u les premiers avis de confirmation, il n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 les avoir re\u00e7us[7]. En effet, il les a lus dans la salle de bains \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2021. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des pr\u00e9somptions l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 244(14) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et au paragraphe 335(10) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, et de la preuve par affidavit fournie par l\u2019ARC, je conclus que les avis de confirmation originaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Oliveira le 10 mai 2021[8].\n[17] Bien que le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour introduire ses appels devant notre Cour ait expir\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2021 lorsqu\u2019il a re\u00e7u les avis de remplacement, M. Oliveira \u00e9tait encore dans le d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pr\u00e9vu par la loi pour demander \u00e0 notre Cour de rendre des ordonnances prorogeant le d\u00e9lai d\u2019introduction de ces appels. Il n\u2019a introduit ces demandes que le 13 septembre 2022. Le d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pr\u00e9vu par la loi \u00e9tait alors expir\u00e9.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je conclus ce qui suit :\nLe 30 septembre 2019\nL\u2019ARC \u00e9met des cotisations fond\u00e9es sur la responsabilit\u00e9 des administrateurs en application de l\u2019article 227.1 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019article 323 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Oliveira.\nLe 19 d\u00e9cembre 2019\nM. Oliveira s\u2019oppose aux cotisations en signifiant un avis d\u2019opposition au ministre du Revenu national en application du paragraphe 165(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et en d\u00e9posant un avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du ministre du Revenu national en application du paragraphe 301(1) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise[9].\nLe 10 mai 2021\nL\u2019ARC envoie \u00e0 M. Oliveira un avis de confirmation des cotisations \u00e9tablies en application de l\u2019article 227.1 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 169(1) de cette Loi, et envoie \u00e0 M. Oliveira un avis de confirmation de la cotisation \u00e9tablie en application de l\u2019article 323 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 301(5) de cette Loi.\nLe 8 ao\u00fbt 2021\nLe d\u00e9lai de 90 jours dont dispose M. Oliveira pour interjeter appel devant notre Cour en application du paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019article 306 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise pour contester les cotisations prend fin.\nLe 9 ao\u00fbt 2021\nM. Oliveira tente d\u2019envoyer par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur une lettre au [traduction] \u00ab Centre d\u2019arrivage des appels de l\u2019Ouest de l\u2019ARC \u00bb dans laquelle il continue de pr\u00e9senter des observations aupr\u00e8s de la Division des appels de l\u2019ARC en ce qui concerne les cotisations[10]. Il n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention d\u2019envoyer la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie \u00e0 notre Cour.\nLe 26 ao\u00fbt 2021\n\u00c0 la demande de M. Oliveira, l\u2019ARC envoie des copies de remplacement des avis de confirmation initialement envoy\u00e9s le 10 mai 2021. Ayant re\u00e7u ces copies, il sait ce qu\u2019il doit faire pour interjeter appel devant notre Cour[11]. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas eu le temps d\u2019introduire ses appels devant la Cour, il a eu le temps de demander des prorogations de d\u00e9lai pour introduire les appels dans le d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\nLe 8 ao\u00fbt 2022\nLe d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oliveira pour demander \u00e0 notre Cour une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 305(5)a) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise expire.\nLe 13 septembre 2022\nM. Oliveira demande \u00e0 la Cour une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel en application du paragraphe 167(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et du paragraphe 305(1) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.\nObservations de M. Oliveira\n[19] L\u2019avocat de M. Oliveira s\u2019est fortement appuy\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision du juge Boyle dans l\u2019affaire Hickerty c. La Reine, 2007 CCI 482. Dans cette affaire, le juge Boyle a constat\u00e9 que Mme Hickerty avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel aupr\u00e8s de notre Cour, mais qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la mauvaise adresse \u2013 une adresse appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019ARC qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par cette derni\u00e8re. Le juge Boyle a notamment constat\u00e9 les faits suivants :\n1)La contribuable a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 interjeter appel devant la Cour presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de la d\u00e9cision que la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des appels de l\u2019ARC avait rendue au sujet de ses oppositions;\n2)La contribuable a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son avis d\u2019appel et elle l\u2019a envoy\u00e9 par la poste;\n3)Malheureusement, la contribuable a envoy\u00e9 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la mauvaise adresse. Elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019information de l\u2019ARC pour obtenir l\u2019adresse de la Cour, et elle a envoy\u00e9 l\u2019avis \u00e0 l\u2019adresse qu\u2019on lui avait donn\u00e9e. Malheureusement, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la bonne adresse. [...][12]\n[20] Dans ces circonstances, le juge Boyle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas compter la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle Mme Hickerty croyait raisonnablement, mais \u00e0 tort, avoir valablement interjet\u00e9 appel dans le d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu[13].\n[21] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont je dispose, j\u2019estime toutefois que M. Oliveira n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention d\u2019envoyer sa t\u00e9l\u00e9copie du 9 ao\u00fbt 2021 \u00e0 notre Cour, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019ARC. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, m\u00eame si M. Oliveira avait cru que sa t\u00e9l\u00e9copie \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ses appels, cette croyance n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable[14]. Il n\u2019a pas pris au s\u00e9rieux les termes des avis de confirmation originaux qui lui indiquaient la marche \u00e0 suivre s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ARC. Il n\u2019a pas non plus pris au s\u00e9rieux les m\u00eames termes dans les copies de remplacement des avis de confirmation qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues trois mois plus tard. En effet, il a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 lors de son contre-interrogatoire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les copies de remplacement, il a pris conscience de ce qu\u2019il devait faire pour interjeter appel devant notre Cour[15].\n[22] L\u2019avocat de M. Oliveira a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Breathe E-Z Homes Ltd. c. M.R.N., 2014 CCI 122, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son argumentation. Les faits de cette d\u00e9cision sont eux aussi diff\u00e9rents. Ayant \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des dispositions semblables, le juge Bocock a fait droit \u00e0 une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai de la part de Breathe E-Z Homes, bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai prorog\u00e9. Elle avait donn\u00e9 des instructions appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 son avocat, mais ce dernier n\u2019y a pas donn\u00e9 suite. Le juge Bocock a notamment constat\u00e9 les faits suivants :\n(a)la requ\u00e9rante a raisonnablement fait ce qu\u2019elle pouvait pour en appeler des nouvelles cotisations;\n(b)la requ\u00e9rante entretenait de mani\u00e8re raisonnable la croyance erron\u00e9e selon laquelle les choses suivaient leur cours normal;\n(c)la requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait diligente et tenait compte des d\u00e9lais et des \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers dont elle \u00e9tait inform\u00e9e[16].\n[23] Ici, c\u2019est le contraire. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu les termes clairs des avis de confirmation, je constate ce qui suit :\n(a)M. Oliveira n\u2019a pas fait ce qu\u2019il aurait pu raisonnablement faire pour en appeler des cotisations;\n(b)M. Oliveira n\u2019a pas entretenu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable la croyance erron\u00e9e selon laquelle les choses suivaient leur cours normal;\n(c)M. Oliveira n\u2019a pas fait preuve de diligence puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas tenu compte du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel devant notre Cour \u2013 d\u00e9lai dont l\u2019ARC l\u2019a express\u00e9ment inform\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis de confirmation initial et dans l\u2019avis de confirmation de remplacement.\n[24] Enfin, l\u2019avocat de M. Oliveira m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de tenir compte de la justice et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, en particulier de ce qui suit :\n(a)Le plaidoyer de M. Oliveira selon lequel il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 administrateur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 num\u00e9ro;\n(b)L\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de M. Oliveira \u00e0 payer les cotisations d\u2019environ 180 000 $;\n(c)Le retard de M. Oliveira d\u2019\u00e0 peine 36 jours pour d\u00e9poser ses demandes.\n[25] Pour rejeter la demande de l\u2019avocat, je ne peux faire mieux que de renvoyer aux d\u00e9cisions invoqu\u00e9es par la juge Lafleur \u00e0 la fin de ses motifs dans l\u2019affaire Pietrovito c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 119 :\n[86] Finalement, voici mes derni\u00e8res observations : aucune consid\u00e9ration d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 ou d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne peut aider l\u2019appelant \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour est une cour cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi. Comme on l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Odebala-Fregene, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e [2015 CCI 44] :\n22 Compte tenu de la nature sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e du r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu par la Loi et du fait que la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi, les exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne s\u2019appliquent pas. Dans ses observations, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Chaya c Canada, 2004 CAF 327, 2004 DTC 6676 (CAF), dans lequel la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9roger au d\u00e9lai pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Au paragraphe 4 de la d\u00e9cision, le juge d\u2019appel Rothstein (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n4 [\u2026] Elle ne peut pas d\u00e9roger aux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. S\u2019il estime que la loi est in\u00e9quitable, le demandeur doit avoir recours au Parlement et non pas \u00e0 la Cour.\n[26] Si M. Oliveira avait pris au s\u00e9rieux les termes des avis de confirmation originaux, il aurait introduit ses appels devant notre Cour dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours. Toutefois, m\u00eame s\u2019il a pris connaissance de la marche \u00e0 suivre \u00e0 la fin du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2021, lorsqu\u2019il a re\u00e7u les avis de remplacement, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9poser des demandes de prorogation de d\u00e9lai aupr\u00e8s de notre Cour afin d\u2019introduire ses appels dans le d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de un an pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\nConclusion\n[27] Aux termes du paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019article 306 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, M. Oliveira disposait d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter du 10 mai 2021 pour interjeter appel devant notre Cour. Ce d\u00e9lai de 90 jours expirait le 8 ao\u00fbt 2021. Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 305(5)a) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, M. Oliveira avait jusqu\u2019au 8 ao\u00fbt 2022 pour demander des ordonnances prorogeant le d\u00e9lai pour introduire ses appels aupr\u00e8s de notre Cour. Il n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ces demandes que le 13 septembre 2022.\n[28] Je dois par cons\u00e9quent rejeter les demandes de M. Oliveira visant \u00e0 obtenir des ordonnances de prorogation du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel aux termes du paragraphe 167(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et du paragraphe 305(1) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.

La Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019obligation analogue d\u2019envoyer un avis de confirmation par courrier recommand\u00e9 ou certifi\u00e9.\n[5] Pi\u00e8ce R-3, par. 3 \u00e0 6.\n[6] Pi\u00e8ce R-1.\n[7] M.

Il n\u2019est donc pas \u00e9tonnant qu\u2019il ne se souvienne pas de la date \u00e0 laquelle il a re\u00e7u les premiers avis de confirmation.\n[8] Outre le paragraphe 335(10) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, le paragraphe 335(1) de cette Loi est \u00e9galement pertinent puisque le paragraphe 301(5) exige qu\u2019un avis de confirmation soit envoy\u00e9 par courrier recommand\u00e9 ou certifi\u00e9.\n[9] Le paragraphe 165(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu dispose qu\u2019un contribuable qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une cotisation peut \u00ab signifier \u00bb un avis d\u2019opposition au ministre du Revenu national, tandis que le paragraphe 301(1.1) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise dispose qu\u2019une personne qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une cotisation peut \u00ab d\u00e9poser \u00bb un avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du ministre.\n[10] Pi\u00e8ce A-1.

(\u00ab CSS \u00bb) interjette appel des cotisations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurance-emploi et du RPC pour les ann\u00e9es 2016 \u00e0 2018. La seule question \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si les travailleurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 exer\u00e7aient un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension comme le d\u00e9finit la l\u00e9gislation r\u00e9gissant l\u2019assurance-emploi et le RPC. Cette question exige que la Cour tranche si les travailleurs \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s de CSS ou des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants qui lui fournissaient leurs services.\n[2] CSS est une entreprise qui offre des services d\u2019agent de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses clients du secteur de la construction, de la vente au d\u00e9tail, de l\u2019entreposage et du transport par camion. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 une sous-traitante d\u2019une grande entreprise de services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. CSS exerce ses activit\u00e9s sous l\u2019appellation de Canadian Security Services. Durant les ann\u00e9es en question, M. Hasan Shahid \u00e9tait le seul actionnaire et administrateur de l\u2019entreprise. M. Shahid repr\u00e9sentait CSS dans ces appels et \u00e9tait le seul t\u00e9moin.\nI. Le droit applicable [3] J\u2019ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit la loi pertinente dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Loving Home Care Services c. M.R.N., 2014 CCI 71 (conf. par 2015 CAF 68) :\n[3] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) c. Canada (Revenu national), 2013 CAF 85, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9fini le droit applicable dans des appels tels que ceux dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de mani\u00e8re exhaustive et claire, et je ne reproduirai pas les paragraphes 23 et 33 \u00e0 41 des motifs du juge Mainville.\n[4] La question en litige est simplement de savoir si les travailleuses fournissent leurs services de soins personnels en tant que personnes travaillant \u00e0 leur compte.\n[5] Cela exige tout d\u2019abord que je d\u00e9cide si, d\u2019un point de vue subjectif, en me fondant sur les faits, les circonstances et la preuve de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y avait chez les parties une entente ou une intention commune relative \u00e0 leur relation, qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une relation d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9e ou de client \u00e0 entrepreneure ind\u00e9pendante.\n[6] \u00c0 ce stade, un tribunal peut examiner, entre autres choses, la mesure dans laquelle les travailleuses comprenaient les diff\u00e9rences entre les relations d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9 et de client \u00e0 entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, les forces et les faiblesses relatives de leurs positions de n\u00e9gociation, et la mesure dans laquelle de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, dont on peut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, sont corrobor\u00e9s par les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits devant la Cour et sont coh\u00e9rents avec eux.\n[7] La r\u00e9ponse apport\u00e9e \u00e0 cette question n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante. Les parties ne peuvent pas s\u2019entendre sur la qualification juridique qu\u2019il convient de donner \u00e0 leur relation de travail comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait, dans le contexte de la relation de travail, d\u2019une autre condition relative \u00e0 leurs droits, \u00e0 leurs obligations, \u00e0 leurs devoirs et \u00e0 leurs responsabilit\u00e9s. Une intention d\u00e9clar\u00e9e qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un consensus au sujet de la qualification particuli\u00e8re d\u2019une relation de travail, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une relation d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9 ou de client \u00e0 entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, doit, en fait, se fonder sur une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective et v\u00e9rifiable.\n[8] Si les parties ont convenu de qualifier leur relation d\u2019une certaine mani\u00e8re, la Cour doit \u00e9tablir si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective globale de leur relation de travail \u00e9taye leur intention subjective et si elle est coh\u00e9rente avec elle.\n[9] Cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape exige de la Cour qu\u2019elle examine et soup\u00e8se les crit\u00e8res traditionnels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finis dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door[1], \u00e0 savoir le contr\u00f4le sur le travail et le travailleur (y compris le degr\u00e9 de subordination du travailleur), la fourniture des outils, du mat\u00e9riel, de l\u2019agr\u00e9ment et de l\u2019\u00e9quipement n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement du travail ainsi que l\u2019\u00e9tendue des succ\u00e8s et des revers financiers qui pourraient d\u00e9couler pour le travailleur des services fournis.\n[10] Dans le contexte de cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, la Cour peut encore une fois examiner l\u2019intention des parties, en m\u00eame temps que leur comportement r\u00e9el et toute entente \u00e9crite en vigueur entre elles. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Royal Winnipeg Ballet c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national) (CAF)[2], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les crit\u00e8res traditionnels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finis dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door devaient \u00eatre examin\u00e9s en tenant compte de l\u2019intention des parties.\n[11] Par ailleurs, cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape est identique \u00e0 celle que la Cour adopterait dans les cas o\u00f9 les parties n\u2019auraient aucune intention commune en ce qui concerne la qualification de leur relation de travail.\nII. L\u2019intention [4] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Shahid, tant CSS que ses travailleurs pr\u00e9voyaient que les travailleurs seraient des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants. Les travailleurs en conviennent dans la convention des services de sous-traitants sur laquelle s\u2019appuie M. Shahid.\n[5] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne peux d\u00e9terminer si cette intention \u00e9tait partag\u00e9e. Les intentions d\u2019une partie sont intrins\u00e8quement subjectives, quoique les tribunaux cherchent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les intentions d\u00e9clar\u00e9es sont en accord avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve objectifs. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucun des travailleurs n\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et j\u2019ignore donc leur intention, ce qu\u2019ils ont compris du contenu du contrat, ou ce qu\u2019ils ont compris des \u00e9l\u00e9ments couverts par la convention qu\u2019ils ont accept\u00e9s et en regard desquels ils se sont engag\u00e9s. Au vu des contradictions et des ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s importantes que contient le contrat type de CSS, telles qu\u2019elles sont d\u00e9crites ci-dessous sous \u00ab Le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le \u00bb, et de l\u2019absence de t\u00e9moignage des travailleurs \u2013 y compris des proches de M. Shahid, je ne dispose pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisamment coh\u00e9rents et cr\u00e9dibles pour conclure que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les travailleurs pr\u00e9voyaient \u00eatre des travailleurs ind\u00e9pendants.\n[6] Je passerai donc \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante, qui consiste \u00e0 examiner et \u00e0 soupeser les crit\u00e8res pertinents d\u00e9finis dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door, \u00e0 savoir le contr\u00f4le sur le travail et le travailleur, la fourniture des outils et du mat\u00e9riel, et l\u2019ampleur des succ\u00e8s et des revers financiers concernant les services fournis par le travailleur.\nIII. Le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le [7] Comme dans de nombreux cas, la question du contr\u00f4le du travail et des travailleurs assur\u00e9 par le payeur est un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] Sur son site Web, CSS offre \u00e0 ses clients la possibilit\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab recruter des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 hautement qualifi\u00e9s \u00bb, auxquels elle [traduction] \u00ab fournit une formation avec un soin m\u00e9ticuleux \u00bb, et s\u2019assure qu\u2019ils [traduction] \u00ab sont enti\u00e8rement cautionn\u00e9s, assur\u00e9s et titulaires d\u2019un permis \u00bb, ce qui comprend [traduction] \u00ab la formation des nouvelles recrues et des agents de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 titulaires d\u2019un permis pour se conformer aux normes minist\u00e9rielles ou les d\u00e9passer \u00bb, des [traduction] \u00ab formations fr\u00e9quentes en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le rendement des employ\u00e9s \u00bb et des [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9valuations du rendement trimestrielles \u00bb. CSS a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab afficher les postes vacants de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 informer les employ\u00e9s et les candidats potentiels des postes \u00e0 pourvoir au sein de l\u2019entreprise \u00bb.\n[9] En ce qui concerne ces sections de son site Web, M. Shahid n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles refl\u00e9taient la pratique actuelle, et non la fa\u00e7on dont CSS exer\u00e7ait ses activit\u00e9s de 2016 \u00e0 2018. Il a plut\u00f4t expliqu\u00e9 que ces sections de son site Web qui renvoyaient \u00e0 la formation et au suivi du rendement \u00e9taient des erreurs commises par ses conseillers-m\u00e9dias, et n\u2019\u00e9taient que simples d\u00e9clarations pour les m\u00e9dias; il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019en fait, CSS n\u2019a jamais fourni de formation. CSS exigeait uniquement que les agents soient titulaires du permis d\u2019exercer appropri\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par la province avant d\u2019\u00eatre embauch\u00e9s. Je n\u2019ai aucune id\u00e9e de la formation qui entre en jeu dans l\u2019obtention d\u2019un permis d\u2019exercer, si tant est qu\u2019il y en ait une. Cela soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales quant \u00e0 la description donn\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moin des activit\u00e9s de CSS et de son r\u00f4le aupr\u00e8s de ses agents.\n[10] La convention des services de sous-traitants de CSS comprend ce qui suit :\nElle comporte une exigence selon laquelle le travailleur ne peut pas quitter son poste ou son lieu de travail durant les heures de travail pr\u00e9vu.\nElle mentionne des pauses pay\u00e9es durant les heures de travail.\nElle inclut un renvoi \u00e0 la convention \u00e0 titre de \u00ab convention collective \u00bb.\nElle comprend deux paragraphes intitul\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab Conformit\u00e9 au droit de l\u2019immigration \u00bb.\nElle mentionne une p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai de quatre-vingt-dix jours qui autorise le licenciement sans pr\u00e9avis.\nElle pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019inobservation des exigences minimales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019avis entra\u00eene une mesure disciplinaire.\nDans la partie indiquant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, elle pr\u00e9cise un minimum provincial de 44 heures pour les employ\u00e9s et laisse entendre que les travailleurs ne devraient sous-traiter aucun travail de plus de 44 heures \u00e0 un autre travailleur.\nElle pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019entreprise doit \u00eatre inform\u00e9e au moins trente jours \u00e0 l\u2019avance d\u2019un d\u00e9part en vacances, que l\u2019approbation est requise, qu\u2019elle est au gr\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise, et que le nombre de ces jours de cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9 est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 soixante jours par an.\nElle indique que le co\u00fbt de l\u2019uniforme et de l\u2019\u00e9quipement fournis sera pay\u00e9 au moyen de retenues \u00e0 m\u00eame le ch\u00e8que de paie.\nElle aborde la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s, son taux ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par M. Shahid comme \u00e9tant un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de jour f\u00e9ri\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la moyenne, selon la l\u00e9gislation appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019emploi en Ontario.\nDans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Shahid a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019entreprise pr\u00e9sume que la loi sur le salaire minimum en vigueur en Ontario est appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 ses sous-traitants.\nL\u2019entreprise a mis en place une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement et une politique anti-violence complexes qui pr\u00e9voient une enqu\u00eate, des processus officiels et non officiels de traitement des griefs, des mesures correctives, des mesures disciplinaires, des mises \u00e0 pied disciplinaires et des p\u00e9riodes de mise \u00e0 pied, et la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des licenciements.\n\u00b7 Elle renvoie \u00e0 un ch\u00e8que d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part qui doit \u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi provinciale ou f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb.\n[11] Tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus semblent plus ou moins indiquer que le type de contr\u00f4le en place est plus couramment utilis\u00e9 dans des situations d\u2019emploi qu\u2019avec des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants.\n[12] La convention des services de sous-traitants pr\u00e9voit clairement qu\u2019un travailleur peut travailler pour d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s, y compris d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019il se conforme \u00e0 la convention. Dans le cas des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, cela ne semble pas incompatible avec de nombreux types d\u2019emplois, comme ceux de serveur dans un restaurant, d\u2019employ\u00e9 dans le commerce de d\u00e9tail, etc., au niveau du salaire minimum. Je ne pense pas que ce facteur aide vraiment en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[13] M. Shahid a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fourni une description du travail, qu\u2019il avait soulign\u00e9 les attentes en mati\u00e8re de travail pour les quarts propos\u00e9s sur les lieux des clients, qu\u2019il avait fourni aux travailleurs les directives sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019accomplir leurs t\u00e2ches, et qu\u2019il assurait un suivi et transmettait des commentaires concernant leur travail, tant du point de vue de CSS que de ses clients.\n[14] M. Shahid a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun membre de CSS ne supervisait ou ne contr\u00f4lait le travail effectu\u00e9 par les travailleurs ou la fa\u00e7on dont il \u00e9tait accompli. CSS indiquait aux travailleurs de quelle personne ils relevaient sur les lieux du client et que cette personne leur donnerait les instructions. L\u2019incidence de la supervision ou du contr\u00f4le d\u2019un travailleur exerc\u00e9 par le client du payeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 jusque-l\u00e0 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Cour comme refl\u00e9tant la supervision et le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9s par le payeur dans des circonstances comparables. Il est \u00e9crit ce qui suit au paragraphe 46 de Loving Home Care :\n[46] En ce qui concerne le r\u00f4le des familles dans les communications quotidiennes relatives aux soins n\u00e9cessaires ou apport\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions que la juge Woods a rendues dans la d\u00e9cision Dean (Ana\u2019s Care & Home Support) c. Canada (Revenu national), 2012 CCI 370, c\u2019est le pouvoir que Loving Home Care avait de contr\u00f4ler et d\u2019encadrer la mani\u00e8re d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches qui est le point le plus significatif, et non la fr\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle ce pouvoir devait \u00eatre ou \u00e9tait exerc\u00e9 dans cette mesure. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec l\u2019observation de la juge Woods selon laquelle, dans un contexte de prestation de soins \u00e0 domicile, puisque les travailleuses avaient pass\u00e9 un contrat avec Loving Home Care et non avec les clients de Loving Home Care, toutes les instructions fournies par les clients auxquelles elles devaient se conformer \u00e9quivalaient au contr\u00f4le dont elles faisaient l\u2019objet aux termes de leurs obligations envers Loving Home Care.\nCela s\u2019applique de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[15] CSS invoque \u00e9galement le fait que la plupart des travailleurs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des travailleurs r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 temps plein ou \u00e0 temps partiel. Le sens du terme \u00ab emploi \u00bb dans les d\u00e9finitions d\u2019\u00ab emploi assurable \u00bb et \u00ab d\u2019emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00bb ne se limite pas aux travailleurs r\u00e9guliers. Il est suffisamment large pour inclure ce qui pourrait d\u00e9crire des employ\u00e9s occasionnels. Le recours \u00e0 des travailleurs intermittents, ou occasionnels, peut \u00eatre courant dans une \u00e9conomie des petits boulots, mais ce type de travailleur n\u2019est pas exclu de la cat\u00e9gorie des travailleurs occasionnels lorsque les crit\u00e8res pertinents sont examin\u00e9s et soupes\u00e9s.\n[16] Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis d\u2019avis que le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par CSS sur le travail et la subordination des travailleurs \u00e0 CSS penchent clairement en faveur de l\u2019emploi plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en faveur du statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nIV. Les outils, la d\u00e9livrance de permis et les fournitures [17] CSS a exig\u00e9 que les travailleurs portent des uniformes d\u2019agent de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 portant sa marque, mais il arrivait que des clients refusent que les logos ou la marque de CSS soient pr\u00e9sents sur les uniformes ou les v\u00e9hicules. Les travailleurs utilisaient leurs propres v\u00e9hicules et, au besoin, des insignes magn\u00e9tiques et des lampes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les identifiant en tant que personnel de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 leur \u00e9taient fournis par CSS. Il arrivait aussi que les clients de CSS refusent que la marque CSS figure sur le v\u00e9hicule, ou exigeaient des v\u00e9hicules exempts de marques. Les travailleurs devaient avoir leur propre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire pendant le travail. Dans les circonstances, et compte tenu de l\u2019absence de t\u00e9moignage de travailleurs sur la fa\u00e7on et l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ces t\u00e9l\u00e9phones \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s et sur la partie qui en assumait les co\u00fbts, etc., je conclus que les outils, les fournitures, etc., repr\u00e9sentent un crit\u00e8re neutre en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Shahid \u00e9tait un peu trop fluide sur ces points, et je ne puis conclure, n\u2019ayant entendu aucun t\u00e9moignage de travailleur, \u00e0 une pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s selon laquelle les travailleurs payaient leur propre assurance, leur cautionnement, etc., au moyen de retenues sur leurs ch\u00e8ques de paie avec lesquels ils touchaient un salaire minimum. De plus, la somme pay\u00e9e par les travailleurs pour leurs uniformes et leurs fournitures \u00e0 CSS demeure vague.\n[18] Lorsqu\u2019ils travaillaient sur des chantiers, les travailleurs devaient fournir leurs propres casques, bottes et vestes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. C\u2019est le type d\u2019information qui pourrait \u00eatre requis tant dans des situations d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant que dans des situations d\u2019emploi; ces facteurs n\u2019ont donc aucun poids.\nV. L\u2019avantage financier et le risque de perte [19] CSS n\u2019a pu indiquer aucun avantage financier dont les travailleurs auraient pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de leur travail qu\u2019ils accomplissaient pour CSS, ni aucun risque auquel ce travail aurait pu les exposer, que ce soit de nature op\u00e9rationnelle, commerciale ou entrepreneuriale. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 concernant un quelconque travailleur qui aurait pu avoir d\u2019autres clients dans une activit\u00e9 de sous-traitance \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, les travailleurs auraient d\u00fb en t\u00e9moigner. Les travailleurs pourraient accepter plus d\u2019heures de travail ou n\u00e9gocier un taux horaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour \u00eatre plus rentable. Les travailleurs auraient pu subir une perte si l\u2019utilisation de leur v\u00e9hicule ou de leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone personnels leur avait occasionn\u00e9 trop de frais, s\u2019ils avaient endommag\u00e9 le bien d\u2019un client de CSS, ou s\u2019ils avaient fait l\u2019objet des sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires pr\u00e9vues dans la convention des services de sous-traitants de CSS.\n[20] Ce n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas le type de consid\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res qui aident \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un travailleur exploite r\u00e9ellement sa propre entreprise ou travaille plut\u00f4t en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 pour une entreprise exploit\u00e9e par quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre.\n[21] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019estime que les consid\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res relatives \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ou du risque de subir une perte penchent en faveur de l\u2019emploi plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en faveur du statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n[22] Concernant mon examen et ma pond\u00e9ration des crit\u00e8res ci-dessus, il convient \u00e9galement de noter que rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res durant les ann\u00e9es en question, apr\u00e8s que CSS a requalifi\u00e9 les travailleurs en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9s et commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer toutes les retenues salariales appropri\u00e9es et tous les versements des montants relatifs aux employeurs et aux employ\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9mission des cotisations d\u2019assurance-emploi et du RPC en question. On ne peut pas simplement choisir entre le statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 et le statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant en d\u00e9pit des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s sous-jacentes, ni simplement requalifier des changements absents dans les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s sous-jacentes.\n[23] Tout bien pes\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de tous les crit\u00e8res pertinents et les avoir soupes\u00e9s, je conclus que les travailleurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\n[24] Les appels sont rejet\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 22e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nLe juge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 34\nNOS DES DOSSIERS DE LA COUR :\n2019-3371(EI)\n2019-3372(CPP)\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nCANADIAN SECURITY & MOBILE PATROL LTD. c.

L\u2019aper\u00e7u\n[1] Il est ici question d\u2019un appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (L.R.C. 1985, ch.1 (5e suppl.), telle que modifi\u00e9e.

Elle a commenc\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s par la fabrication de bijoux artisanaux et, \u00e0 compter de 2013, a ajout\u00e9 la production en mode industriel avec l\u2019usage de moules.\n[4] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en cause, l\u2019appelante a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de RS&DE en lien avec les projets suivants :\n2015-01 \u2013 Am\u00e9liorations et d\u00e9veloppement des op\u00e9rations secondaires;\n2015-02 \u2013 D\u00e9veloppement des outils et conception des moules.\nII. Les questions en litige\n[5] Les activit\u00e9s r\u00e9alis\u00e9es dans le cadre de ces deux projets constituent-elles des activit\u00e9s de RS&DE au sens de la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 248(1) de la Loi? Si la Cour conclut qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de RS&DE, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\n[6] Si la Cour conclut dans l\u2019affirmative, elle doit ensuite d\u00e9terminer si les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante sont d\u00e9ductibles en vertu de l\u2019article 37 et admissibles pour le calcul du CII en vertu du paragraphe 127(5) de la Loi.\nIII. Les hypoth\u00e8ses de faits\n[7] Pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation dont il est ici question, la ministre a tenu pour acquis certains faits au paragraphe 16 de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n[8] Sans reprendre l\u2019ensemble de ces hypoth\u00e8ses de faits, il suffit de dire que le premier projet intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Am\u00e9liorations et d\u00e9veloppement des op\u00e9rations secondaires \u00bb \u00e9tait un regroupement de quatre sous-projets qui visaient \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les proc\u00e9dures de finition de polissage, de finition manuelle et de l\u2019impression 3D pour les composantes des bijoux en \u00e9tain et \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l\u2019am\u00e9nagement de l\u2019atelier.\n[9] La ministre a conclu, et je r\u00e9sume, que les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient de nature qualitative, qu\u2019ils n\u2019avan\u00e7aient pas les connaissances scientifiques ou technologiques de l\u2019appelante et, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9e par une incertitude scientifique ou technologique.\n[10] Toujours selon les hypoth\u00e8ses de faits, le deuxi\u00e8me projet intitul\u00e9 \u00ab D\u00e9veloppement des outils et conception des moules \u00bb \u00e9tait un regroupement de dix sous-projets qui visaient \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou optimiser des composantes de bijoux et des moules et \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer des outils. La ministre a encore conclu que les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient qualitatifs et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019incertitude scientifique ou technologique ou d\u2019avancement technologique.\nIV. Le droit applicable\n[11] Le paragraphe 248(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nactivit\u00e9s de recherche scientifique et de d\u00e9veloppement exp\u00e9rimental Investigation ou recherche syst\u00e9matique d\u2019ordre scientifique ou technologique, effectu\u00e9e par voie d\u2019exp\u00e9rimentation ou d\u2019analyse, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire :\na) la recherche pure, \u00e0 savoir les travaux entrepris pour l\u2019avancement de la science sans aucune application pratique en vue;\nb) la recherche appliqu\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir les travaux entrepris pour l\u2019avancement de la science avec application pratique en vue;\nc) le d\u00e9veloppement exp\u00e9rimental, \u00e0 savoir les travaux entrepris dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du progr\u00e8s technologique en vue de la cr\u00e9ation de nouveaux mat\u00e9riaux, dispositifs, produits ou proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ou de l\u2019am\u00e9lioration, m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8re, de ceux qui existent.\nPour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition \u00e0 un contribuable, sont compris parmi les activit\u00e9s de recherche scientifique et de d\u00e9veloppement exp\u00e9rimental :\nd) les travaux entrepris par le contribuable ou pour son compte relativement aux travaux de g\u00e9nie, \u00e0 la conception, \u00e0 la recherche op\u00e9rationnelle, \u00e0 l\u2019analyse math\u00e9matique, \u00e0 la programmation informatique, \u00e0 la collecte de donn\u00e9es, aux essais et \u00e0 la recherche psychologique, lorsque ces travaux sont proportionnels aux besoins des travaux vis\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as a), b) ou c) qui sont entrepris au Canada par le contribuable ou pour son compte et servent \u00e0 les appuyer directement.\nNe constituent pas des activit\u00e9s de recherche scientifique et de d\u00e9veloppement exp\u00e9rimental les travaux relatifs aux activit\u00e9s suivantes :\ne) l\u2019\u00e9tude du march\u00e9 et la promotion des ventes;\nf) le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 ou la mise \u00e0 l\u2019essai normale des mat\u00e9riaux, dispositifs, produits ou proc\u00e9d\u00e9s;\ng) la recherche dans les sciences sociales ou humaines;\nh) la prospection, l\u2019exploration et le forage fait en vue de la d\u00e9couverte de min\u00e9raux, de p\u00e9trole ou de gaz naturel et leur production;\ni) la production commerciale d\u2019un mat\u00e9riau, d\u2019un dispositif ou d\u2019un produit nouveau ou am\u00e9lior\u00e9, et l\u2019utilisation commerciale d\u2019un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 nouveau ou am\u00e9lior\u00e9;\nj) les modifications de style;\nk) la collecte normale de donn\u00e9es.

La Reine, 2012 CCI 376, la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue par la Loi est fond\u00e9e sur un concept \u00ab d\u2019inclusion et d\u2019exclusion \u00bb puisqu\u2019elle inclut d\u2019abord un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement aux alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 d), suivis d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont exclus aux alin\u00e9as e) \u00e0 k) (par. 13).\n[13] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la d\u00e9cision maitresse est Northwest Hydraulic Consultants Ltd. c. La Reine, [1998] 3 CTC 2520 (\u00ab Northwest Hydraulic \u00bb) o\u00f9 le juge Bowman, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, a \u00e9tabli les cinq crit\u00e8res suivants pour d\u00e9terminer si des travaux constituaient des activit\u00e9s de RS&DE :\nQ1 : Existait-il une incertitude scientifique ou technologique qui ne pouvait pas \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e par des proc\u00e9dures habituelles ou des \u00e9tudes techniques courantes?\nQ2 : Des hypoth\u00e8ses visant express\u00e9ment \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ou \u00e0 \u00e9liminer cette incertitude ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es?\nQ3 : L\u2019approche globale adopt\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle conforme \u00e0 une investigation ou recherche syst\u00e9matique, incluant la formulation et la v\u00e9rification des hypoth\u00e8ses par voie d\u2019exp\u00e9rimentation ou d\u2019analyse?\nQ4 : L\u2019approche globale adopt\u00e9e visait-elle \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un avancement scientifique ou technologique?\nQ5 : Un registre ou un compte rendu d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des hypoth\u00e8ses v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es et des r\u00e9sultats a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu au cours des travaux?\n[14] Le cadre analytique ainsi \u00e9tabli par le juge Bowman a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 dans les arr\u00eats R I S - Christie Ltd. c. Canada, [1999] 1 CTC 132, CW Agencies Inc. c. Canada, 2001 CAF 393 (\u00ab CW Agencies \u00bb), Kam-Press Metal Products Ltd. c. Canada, 2021 CAF 88 (\u00ab Kam-Press \u00bb) et plus r\u00e9cemment dans National R&D Inc. c. Canada, 2022 CAF 72 (\u00ab National R&D \u00bb), tous de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[15] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kam-Press, la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 que m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune mention de l\u2019expression \u00ab m\u00e9thode scientifique \u00bb dans la d\u00e9finition de RS&DE, le r\u00f4le du tribunal n'est pas simplement de r\u00e9citer les mots exacts qui sont utilis\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur, mais d'interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions de la Loi ou du R\u00e8glement en se fondant sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que le juge Bowman interpr\u00e9tait la d\u00e9finition de la RS&DE (par. 6).\n[16] \u00ab Afin d\u2019\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 titre d\u2019activit\u00e9s de RS&DE, on doit r\u00e9pondre par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 chacun des questions du crit\u00e8re \u00e0 cinq volets \u00bb Lehigh Hanson Materials Limited c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 205, par. 37. Dans la d\u00e9cision CRL Engineering Ltd. c. La Reine, 2019 CCI 65, j\u2019ai fait l\u2019analyse suivante que l\u2019appelante a reprise aux paragraphes 10 \u00e0 15 de sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite :\n[7] (\u2026) En ce qui concerne le premier crit\u00e8re, le juge Bowman a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019expression \u00ab risque ou incertitude technologique \u00bb exigeait une incertitude qui \u00ab ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e par les \u00e9tudes techniques courantes ou par les proc\u00e9dures habituelles \u00bb et que si \u00ab la r\u00e9solution du probl\u00e8me est raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la proc\u00e9dure habituelle ou des \u00e9tudes techniques courantes, il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019incertitude technologique \u00bb. L\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e9tudes techniques courantes \u00bb ferait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00ab aux techniques, aux proc\u00e9dures et aux donn\u00e9es qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accessibles aux sp\u00e9cialistes comp\u00e9tents dans le domaine \u00bb (au paragraphe 16).\n[8] En ce qui concerne le deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, le juge Bowman a indiqu\u00e9 (au paragraphe 16) qu\u2019il comportait un processus en cinq \u00e9tapes : i) l\u2019observation de l\u2019objet du probl\u00e8me; ii) la formulation d\u2019un objectif clair; iii) la d\u00e9termination et la formulation de l\u2019incertitude technologique; iv) la formulation d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ou \u00e0 \u00e9liminer l\u2019incertitude; v) la v\u00e9rification m\u00e9thodique et syst\u00e9matique des hypoth\u00e8ses. Bien qu\u2019il soit important de pr\u00e9ciser l\u2019\u00ab incertitude technologique \u00bb d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du projet, la d\u00e9termination de nouvelles incertitudes technologiques au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les recherches avancent, en ayant recours \u00e0 une \u00ab m\u00e9thode scientifique \u00bb, fait partie int\u00e9grante du processus.\n[9] En ce qui concerne le troisi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, le juge Bowman a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que \u00ab la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 intuitive et m\u00eame l\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 peuvent avoir un r\u00f4le crucial dans le processus \u00bb, \u00e0 condition que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments existent dans le cadre de la m\u00e9thode scientifique dans son ensemble, et que \u00ab [c]e qui peut sembler habituel et \u00e9vident apr\u00e8s coup ne l\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas au d\u00e9but des travaux \u00bb. Ce qui est important, c\u2019est \u00ab l\u2019adoption de la m\u00e9thode scientifique [...] dans son ensemble \u00bb, en vue d\u2019\u00e9liminer \u00ab une incertitude technologique au moyen de la formulation et de la v\u00e9rification d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses innovatrices non v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es \u00bb (au paragraphe 16).\n[10] En ce qui concerne le quatri\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, le juge Bowman a indiqu\u00e9 (au paragraphe 16) qu\u2019il faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 \u00ab un progr\u00e8s en ce qui concerne la compr\u00e9hension g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [...] pour les personnes qui s\u2019y connaissent dans le domaine \u00bb et que \u00ab [l]e rejet, apr\u00e8s l\u2019essai d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se, constitue n\u00e9anmoins un progr\u00e8s en ce sens qu\u2019il \u00e9limine une hypoth\u00e8se jusque-l\u00e0 non v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e \u00bb, ajoutant qu\u2019il est possible que l\u2019\u00e9chec m\u00eame renforce \u00ab le degr\u00e9 d\u2019incertitude technologique \u00bb.\n[11] Le cinqui\u00e8me crit\u00e8re est inclus dans la notion de \u00ab m\u00e9thode scientifique \u00bb. Une fois de plus, le juge Bowman a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab un compte rendu d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des hypoth\u00e8ses, des essais et des r\u00e9sultats, doi[t] \u00eatre fait, et ce, au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l\u2019avancement des travaux \u00bb (au paragraphe 16), m\u00eame si la Loi et son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application ne le pr\u00e9voient pas express\u00e9ment. Cela semble \u00e9vident, puisque l\u2019expression \u00ab investigation syst\u00e9matique \u00bb appara\u00eet au d\u00e9but de la d\u00e9finition.\n[12] Le juge Bowman a indiqu\u00e9 (au paragraphe 11) qu\u2019en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00ab la recherche scientifique comporte des progr\u00e8s graduels et, de fait, infimes. Les r\u00e9ussites spectaculaires sont rares et ne constituent qu\u2019une partie infime des r\u00e9sultats de la RS & DE au Canada \u00bb, avant de conclure que \u00ab [l]es stimulants fiscaux accord\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux qui se livrent \u00e0 la RS & DE visent \u00e0 encourager la recherche scientifique au Canada \u00bb et que la l\u00e9gislation concernant pareils stimulants \u00ab s\u2019interpr\u00e8te de la mani\u00e8re la plus \u00e9quitable et la plus large qui soit compatible avec la r\u00e9alisation de son objet \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, L.R.C., 1985, c. I- 21.\n[Mon soulignement]\n[17] Selon une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, il appartient \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les hypoth\u00e8ses de faits sont erron\u00e9es. L\u2019appelante doit satisfaire la Cour que ses activit\u00e9s de recherche r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019activit\u00e9s de RS&DE et que les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9es sont des d\u00e9penses d\u00e9ductibles pour des activit\u00e9s de RS&DE selon l\u2019article 37 de la Loi et des d\u00e9penses admissibles pour le calcul du CII.\nV. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve\n[18] Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport d\u2019expert produit par l\u2019appelante, et ce au motif qu\u2019il ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence, soit la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert. Apr\u00e8s la tenue d\u2019un voir-dire, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9clarer inadmissible le rapport. Les motifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus oralement.\n[19] M. Denis Chagnon et Mme Dulce Gutierrez ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019appelante et Mme Julie Bernier et Mme Heather Filiatrault ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nM. Denis Chagnon\n[20] M. Denis Chagnon (\u00ab M. Chagnon \u00bb) est directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019appelante et le fr\u00e8re de l\u2019artiste, Anne-Marie Chagnon (\u00ab Mme Chagnon \u00bb).\n[21] Il d\u00e9crit d\u2019abord la d\u00e9marche artistique de Mme Chagnon menant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation des bijoux, mais reconnait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la phase \u00ab artisanale \u00bb ou de \u00ab design \u00bb des bijoux qui feront partie de la collection de l\u2019appelante pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e, mais dont il n\u2019est pas question dans cette instance.\n[22] Il explique que Mme Chagnon d\u00e9bute par des croquis faits \u00e0 la main et passe ensuite \u00e0 la sculpture d\u2019un certain nombre de pi\u00e8ces en cire. Par un processus de \u00ab cire perdue \u00bb, ces pi\u00e8ces sont reproduites et la cire est remplac\u00e9e par \u00ab un m\u00e9tal en fusion \u00bb, soit en \u00e9tain ou en bronze pour former une pi\u00e8ce maitresse. Il peut y avoir plusieurs pi\u00e8ces maitresses formant un m\u00eame bijou. La pi\u00e8ce maitresse est ensuite remise \u00e0 l\u2019atelier de la fonderie d\u2019\u00e9tain qui doit \u00eatre en mesure de la reproduire \u00ab sur une base de dizaines de milliers d\u2019exemplaires \u00bb avant de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019assemblage. Pour ce faire, il y a deux \u00e9tapes dont la premi\u00e8re est la fabrication des moules et la deuxi\u00e8me, consiste \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le type de finition pour les pi\u00e8ces.\n[23] Selon M. Chagnon, certaines pi\u00e8ces sont difficiles \u00e0 reproduire et c\u2019est dans la fabrication des moules dans lesquels est vers\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tain pour la reproduction desdites pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019ils rencontrent des difficult\u00e9s. Chaque \u00ab collection \u00bb de bijoux contient \u00ab des pi\u00e8ces in\u00e9dites \u00bb d\u2019o\u00f9 le besoin de fabriquer plusieurs moules. Ces moules sont fabriqu\u00e9s en caoutchouc organique et doivent avoir la capacit\u00e9 de reproduire une pi\u00e8ce identique \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce maitresse et de \u00ab r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un certain nombre de facteurs d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par Mme Chagnon dans la partie moule \u00bb. Ils doivent notamment \u00eatre reproductibles et capables de supporter la chaleur \u00e0 une temp\u00e9rature \u00e9lev\u00e9e et une rotation \u00e0 haute vitesse pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tain de remplir les cavit\u00e9s.\n[24] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Chagnon reconnait que la fabrication des pi\u00e8ces maitresses en \u00e9tain \u00e9tait confi\u00e9e en sous-traitance \u00e0 une fonderie d\u2019\u00e9tain jusqu\u2019en 2013 et que, par la suite, l\u2019appelante a fait des investissements pour pouvoir le faire \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Cependant, ils ont rencontr\u00e9 des d\u00e9fis \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le manque d\u2019expertise.\n[25] M. Chagnon admet que toutes les \u00e9tapes de la fabrication des bijoux sont effectu\u00e9es dans la m\u00eame usine, que l\u2019appelante a \u00ab un seul atelier de fabrication des pi\u00e8ces de moulage \u00bb incluant le polissage ou la finition des bijoux et que les m\u00eames employ\u00e9s travaillent sur toutes les \u00e9tapes de la production de l\u2019usine, dont \u00ab les activit\u00e9s r\u00e9clam\u00e9es \u00bb dans cette instance. M. Chagnon explique que pour d\u00e9terminer quels travaux peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s comme RS&DE, c\u2019est seulement \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e qu\u2019ils revoient leurs notes pour identifier tout ce qui est \u00ab en apparence R&D \u00bb, notamment avec \u00ab le consultant \u00bb.\n[26] En r\u00e9interrogatoire, M. Chagnon explique que dans le grand domaine des bijoux, il y a \u00ab les bijoux de joaillerie \u00bb qui font l\u2019objet de plusieurs programmes d\u2019\u00e9tude au secondaire ou au c\u00e9gep et qui ne sont pas sujets \u00e0 la reproduction \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle. Cependant, pour l\u2019appelante, il s\u2019agit de \u00ab bijoux de fantaisie \u00bb qui sont \u00ab faits en milliers d\u2019exemplaires, \u00e0 la chaine, de fa\u00e7on industrielle (\u2026) \u00bb et donc les techniciens qui ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la bijouterie n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement appris \u00ab comment fonctionnent les machines de production (\u2026) ou de fabrication des moules \u00bb. Il explique qu\u2019il y a eu \u00ab un transfert de connaissances d\u2019artisan en artisan \u00bb, mais que \u00ab l\u2019industrie de la fabrication des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019\u00e9tain est morte aujourd\u2019hui \u00bb puisqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e en Asie, ce qui fait que l\u2019expertise locale n\u2019existe plus ou \u00ab est difficile \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir \u00bb.\nMme Dulce Gutierrez\n[27] Mme Gutierrez s\u2019est jointe \u00e0 l\u2019appelante en 2013 et est cheffe d\u2019atelier depuis 2014. Elle a une formation universitaire comme ing\u00e9nieure en \u00e9lectronique et a travaill\u00e9 pendant environ douze ans pour une compagnie chimique.\n[28] Son r\u00f4le est de g\u00e9rer la production des pi\u00e8ces, l\u2019\u00e9quipe de production, de recevoir les commandes et de g\u00e9rer le d\u00e9veloppement des moules en collaboration avec la cr\u00e9atrice pour les collections courantes. Elle lui donne ses observations sur les aspects techniques qui pourraient avoir un impact sur la production. Elle identifie notamment les pi\u00e8ces qui pourraient cr\u00e9er \u00ab des probl\u00e8mes ou des d\u00e9fis \u00bb.\n[29] Mme Gutierrez relate sa collaboration avec le travail cr\u00e9atif de Mme Chagnon en pr\u00e9cisant que la reproduction de la sculpture en cire par le processus de cire perdue est accomplie par un fournisseur externe. Ils re\u00e7oivent \u00ab un seul prototype en bronze ou en argent \u00bb et il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la pi\u00e8ce maitresse ou \u00ab master \u00bb.\n[30] Elle doit ensuite veiller \u00e0 la reproduction de la pi\u00e8ce maitresse, sans l\u2019endommager, par un processus de \u00ab spin casting \u00bb en cr\u00e9ant \u00ab un moule de master \u00bb. Elle doit produire une pi\u00e8ce identique en tenant compte de la forme, de la texture, de l\u2019apparence et du poids. Une fois r\u00e9ussie, elle doit cr\u00e9er \u00ab un moule de production \u00bb qui est remis \u00e0 l\u2019atelier de production pour la reproduction en masse de la pi\u00e8ce en question. Le moule de production est compos\u00e9 de caoutchouc qui doit \u00eatre vulcanis\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il durcisse. Dans tout ce processus, elle doit notamment tenir compte de la force centrifuge et centrip\u00e8te, de la gravit\u00e9, de la chaleur, du temps, de la vitesse de rotation, de l\u2019\u00e9coulement de l\u2019\u00e9tain en forme liquide et du durcissement en m\u00e9tal. Elle explique qu\u2019elle doit faire cette analyse au d\u00e9but et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle formule ses hypoth\u00e8ses.\n[31] Mme Gutierrez aborde ensuite la question de la finition des bijoux. Elle explique qu\u2019en 2016, ils avaient un fournisseur externe qui apportait \u00ab les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9j\u00e0 oxyd\u00e9es pour cr\u00e9er un look ancien \u00bb. Ce travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Cependant, apr\u00e8s plusieurs tentatives, ils n\u2019avaient pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 ralentir le processus d\u2019oxydation des bijoux. Mme Chagnon a donc opt\u00e9 pour une finition plus brillante en argent ou en bronze. Ils ont d\u00fb faire des essais avec \u00ab diff\u00e9rents types de m\u00e9dias \u00bb et un polisseur rotatif ou vibratoire pour arriver \u00e0 une finition acceptable, \u00ab selon le go\u00fbt de Mme Chagnon \u00bb. En fonction de la finition recherch\u00e9e, elle devait d\u00e9velopper \u00ab une recette \u00bb qui servirait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de production.\n[32] Elle explique qu\u2019elle utilise un calepin dans lequel elle note lesdites \u00ab recettes \u00bb et le temps requis pour compl\u00e9ter chaque \u00e9tape et chaque type de finition. Elle prend aussi note de ses rencontres et discussions avec Mme Chagnon.\n[33] Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle doit satisfaire \u00ab aux attentes de la cr\u00e9atrice \u00bb, notamment \u00ab ses besoins, ses envies, ce qu\u2019elle veut projeter \u00bb. Si Mme Chagnon n\u2019est pas satisfaite, elle doit recommencer le processus, refaire des essais et \u00ab formuler de nouvelles hypoth\u00e8ses \u00bb tant au niveau de la pi\u00e8ce qu\u2019au niveau de la finition.\n[34] En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Gutierrez reconnait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune \u00ab formation ou exp\u00e9rience en moulage \u00bb et peu de formation en conception 3D avant de rejoindre l\u2019appelante. Lorsqu\u2019on lui demande d\u2019identifier \u00ab l\u2019incertitude technologique \u00bb reli\u00e9e \u00ab aux proc\u00e9dures de finition des pi\u00e8ces \u00bb, elle explique qu\u2019il fallait \u00ab ralentir le processus d\u2019oxydation des pi\u00e8ces \u00bb. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 de l\u2019incertitude qui d\u00e9coulait de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019effectuer ce travail \u00e0 l\u2019interne plut\u00f4t que de le laisser \u00e0 l\u2019ancien fournisseur. Ensuite, il y avait une incertitude reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019atteindre une finition brillante, selon les d\u00e9sirs de la cr\u00e9atrice.\n[35] Mme Gutierrez explique aussi qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un tableau Excel pour noter la \u00ab probl\u00e9matique technologique \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre \u00bb, \u00ab l\u2019objectif technologique \u00bb, \u00ab l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se reli\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00bb, le \u00ab r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019activit\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00bb et les heures consacr\u00e9es par employ\u00e9 suivi des d\u00e9penses applicables. Selon elle, il y avait des \u00ab incertitudes technologiques \u00bb, mais certaines relevaient plut\u00f4t d\u2019un \u00ab d\u00e9fi, une chose qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas faite avant \u00bb pour lesquelles elle n\u2019avait \u00ab aucune connaissance \u00bb ou encore lorsqu\u2019il y avait eu un manque au niveau du \u00ab transfert de connaissances \u00bb.\nMme Julie Bernier\n[36] Mme Bernier est conseill\u00e8re en recherche et technologie avec l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb). Elle a une formation d\u2019ing\u00e9nieure chimique, une maitrise en gestion manufacturi\u00e8re et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience pratique dans la recherche et le d\u00e9veloppement, la fabrication de pi\u00e8ces moul\u00e9es et le dessin de moules.\n[37] Elle a visit\u00e9 les locaux de l\u2019appelante \u00ab pour bien comprendre leurs op\u00e9rations \u00bb et ensuite a achev\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019examen de la RS&DE. Elle a fait une analyse globale des op\u00e9rations et a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019incertitude scientifique ou technologique ou d\u2019avancement technologique. Elle a tent\u00e9 de revoir les activit\u00e9s en sous-projet, mais en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\n[38] Mme Bernier a conclu qu\u2019il y avait \u00ab un m\u00e9lange d\u2019activit\u00e9s \u00bb sans \u00ab investigation syst\u00e9matique \u00bb effectu\u00e9es \u00ab par essai\/erreur pour constater si \u00e7a fonctionnait ou non \u00bb et donc il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019investigation syst\u00e9matique \u00bb. De plus, elle a conclu que l\u2019appelante \u00ab utilisait des techniques connues dans l\u2019industrie du moulage \u00bb o\u00f9 il faut souvent \u00ab faire quelques it\u00e9rations puis des fois recommencer le moule \u00bb et donc qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019incertitude scientifique ou technologique. En fin de compte, elle ne voyait pas de liens entre la recherche et le d\u00e9veloppement et la production en masse des bijoux o\u00f9 l\u2019objectif principal \u00e9tait l\u2019aspect esth\u00e9tique ou visuel de la pi\u00e8ce.\n[39] En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Bernier a reconnu qu\u2019elle effectuait une vingtaine de v\u00e9rifications de RS&DE par ann\u00e9e dont environ cinq dans le domaine des moules, mais aucune dans le domaine des bijoux. Elle a reconnu que selon le contexte de l\u2019entreprise, il \u00e9tait possible que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00ab qualitatifs \u00bb soient importants dans la RS&DE, mais que c\u2019\u00e9tait plus au niveau de la pr\u00e9cision.\nMme Heather Filiatrault\n[40] Mme Filiatrault est titulaire d\u2019un baccalaur\u00e9at en chimie, d\u2019un doctorat en \u00e9lectronique et a effectu\u00e9 un postdoctorat dans un laboratoire d\u2019\u00e9lectrochimie. Elle est avec l\u2019ARC depuis 2016 et est conseill\u00e8re en recherche et d\u00e9veloppement depuis 2020. Son travail a port\u00e9 notamment sur la m\u00e9tallurgie et la bijouterie.\n[41] Pour la v\u00e9rification en question, elle a revu le rapport d\u2019examen pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Mme Bernier et compl\u00e9t\u00e9 un addendum \u00e0 son rapport d\u2019examen suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception des repr\u00e9sentations de l\u2019appelante. Puisque son analyse constitue la base de la cotisation, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de revoir son t\u00e9moignage plus en d\u00e9tail.\n[42] En contre-interrogatoire, elle a indiqu\u00e9 que dans son travail avec l\u2019ARC, elle avait effectu\u00e9 seulement une autre v\u00e9rification dans le domaine des bijoux, mais avec une production commerciale et non artisanale.\n[43] Elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa compr\u00e9hension selon laquelle Mme Bernier avait pris une approche globale pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait une incertitude technologique et ensuite qu\u2019elle avait revu les divers sous-projets. Elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nVI. Analyse et conclusion\n[44] Dans un premier temps, la Cour est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 que nonobstant les guides sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des projets de RS&DE publi\u00e9s par l\u2019Agence, le droit applicable est toujours celui de la d\u00e9cision Northwest Hydraulic qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris et confirm\u00e9 dans maintes d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[45] Existait-il une incertitude scientifique ou technologique qui ne pouvait pas \u00eatre \u00e9limin\u00e9e par les proc\u00e9dures habituelles ou les \u00e9tudes techniques courantes ?\n[46] Dans Northwest Hydraulic, le juge Bowman explique qu\u2019il y a \u00ab risque ou incertitude technologique \u00bb lorsqu\u2019une probl\u00e9matique ne peut \u00eatre \u00ab \u00e9limin\u00e9e par les \u00e9tudes techniques courantes ou par les proc\u00e9dures habituelles (\u2026) g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accessibles aux sp\u00e9cialistes comp\u00e9tents dans le domaine \u00bb, sinon il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019incertitude technologique (par. 16). Ces connaissances doivent \u00eatre \u00ab r\u00e9ellement inexistantes dans la base de connaissances scientifiques ou technologiques et non uniquement inconnues du demandeur \u00bb : Formadrain Inc. c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 42 (par. 93). Autrement dit, \u00ab la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un nouveau produit par l\u2019application de techniques, de proc\u00e9dures et de donn\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accessibles aux sp\u00e9cialistes comp\u00e9tents dans le domaine ne constituera pas une activit\u00e9 de RS&DE, m\u00eame s\u2019il existe un doute quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019objectif sera atteint \u00bb : B\u00e9ton Mobile du Qu\u00e9bec Inc. c. La Reine, 2019 CCI 278, par. 43. L\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9sume ceci dans ses plaidoiries \u00e9crites en indiquant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a \u00ab pas de r\u00e9solution d\u2019incertitude technologique si les sp\u00e9cialistes comp\u00e9tents dans le domaine peuvent r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9visible en utilisant des techniques courantes et \u00e9tablies \u00bb.\n[47] Dans cette instance, M. Chagnon parle de d\u00e9fis suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019appelante de produire les pi\u00e8ces maitresses \u00e0 l\u2019interne en indiquant \u00ab qu\u2019on n\u2019\u00e9tait pas capable d\u2019\u00eatre aussi bon que notre fournisseur \u00bb. Il y aurait eu un probl\u00e8me au niveau du \u00ab transfert de connaissances \u00bb, mais ces connaissances existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 puisqu\u2019il a admis qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient transmises d\u2019artisan en artisan. La Cour est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est logique de conclure que ce fournisseur aurait aussi eu les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour fabriquer les moules de productions.\n[48] De m\u00eame, Mme Gutierrez a parl\u00e9 d\u2019incertitude technologique tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait souvent de \u00ab probl\u00e8me \u00bb ou de \u00ab d\u00e9fis \u00bb dus \u00e0 son \u00ab manque de connaissances \u00bb. La Cour note de plus que les d\u00e9fis au niveau de la finition des pi\u00e8ces sont survenus lorsque l\u2019appelante a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer ce travail \u00e0 l\u2019interne. De plus, Mme Gutierrez a admis qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune connaissance dans le domaine du moulage avant de se joindre \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Elle \u00e9tait donc au stade d\u2019apprentissage. Il en est de m\u00eame pour la finition des pi\u00e8ces.\n[49] La Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante aurait pu r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la fabrication des moules et \u00e0 la finition des pi\u00e8ces par des \u00ab \u00e9tudes techniques courantes \u00bb ou des \u00ab proc\u00e9dures habituelles \u00bb connues par \u00ab des sp\u00e9cialistes comp\u00e9tents dans ce domaine \u00bb et que l\u2019ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019incertitude technologique ou scientifique. Il en est de m\u00eame pour les autres sous-projets, dont l\u2019impression 3D et l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019atelier.\n[50] En fin de compte, la Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 son fardeau et n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il y avait une incertitude technologique ou que ses activit\u00e9s constituaient des activit\u00e9s de RS&DE. Il n\u2019y a donc pas lieu de revoir la question des d\u00e9penses admissibles.\n[51] La Cour conclut donc que les activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante ne constituaient pas des activit\u00e9s de RS&DE au sens de la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 248(1) de la Loi.\n[52] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9, sans frais.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 24e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Guy Smith \u00bb\nJuge Smith\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 35\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2020-1663(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nANNE-MARIE CHAGNON INC.

Aux termes du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la partie XIII, la Loi dispose que l\u2019imp\u00f4t doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par les personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes qui re\u00e7oivent un revenu provenant d\u2019un bien de r\u00e9sidents canadiens et impose aux r\u00e9sidents l\u2019obligation de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable par le non-r\u00e9sident.\n[2] David Siscoe, un sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019exercice physique, est actionnaire de l\u2019appelante, qui exploite la salle de sport Siscoe Gym. M. Siscoe a conclu un bail pour les locaux situ\u00e9s au 501-4175 Sainte-Catherine Ouest \u00e0 Westmount, Qu\u00e9bec (unit\u00e9 501). Bien qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 locataire de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501, l\u2019appelante a pay\u00e9 le loyer en son nom au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition frapp\u00e9es d\u2019appel.\n[3] Dans un avis dat\u00e9 du 26 octobre 2018, le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) a \u00e9tabli une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelante parce qu\u2019elle a omis de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII \u00e0 payer sur les revenus de location re\u00e7us par Sebastiana Trimarchi, propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, pour le motif que Mme Trimarchi \u00e9tait une non-r\u00e9sidente.\nII. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires\n[4] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, chaque avocat des parties a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour.\nRequ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante en vue d\u2019obtenir la radiation d\u2019une partie de la r\u00e9ponse\n[5] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir la radiation des parties des hypoth\u00e8ses de fait du ministre dans la r\u00e9ponse pour le motif que les hypoth\u00e8ses des paragraphes 11 c), d), e) et f) contiennent des conclusions de droit. Les paragraphes pertinents sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s comme suit : [traduction]\n11. Pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019obligation fiscale de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 et 2016, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 215 de la partie XIII, le ministre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait suivantes :\n[...]\nc) le condo appartenait \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi (la \u00ab personne non-r\u00e9sidente \u00bb);\nd) Sebastiana Trimarchi est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente vivant en Italie;\ne) au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 et 2016, l\u2019appelante a vers\u00e9 les sommes suivantes \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente [\u2026];\nf) apr\u00e8s le paiement des loyers bruts \u00e0 la personne non-r\u00e9sidente, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 aucune retenue, en application la partie XIII de la Loi;\n[6] L\u2019appelante a fait valoir que les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait jouent un r\u00f4le essentiel dans les contentieux fiscaux compte tenu de leur incidence sur le fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombe. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a soutenu que les hypoth\u00e8ses selon lesquelles Sebastiana Trimarchi est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente comprennent des conclusions de droit. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que le ministre peut conclure que Mme Trimarchi est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente, mais qu\u2019il doit \u00e9noncer les faits sur lesquels cette conclusion est fond\u00e9e. L\u2019avocat s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de notre Cour, Bluecove Management Ltd v R, 2022 TCC 126 [Bluecove], dans laquelle la juge Lafleur a conclu que le ministre doit extraire les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait d\u2019une conclusion mixte de fait et de droit. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada c. Anchor Pointe Energy Lt\u00e9e, 2003 CAF 294, par. 25 et 26, auxquels renvoie la d\u00e9cision Bluecove, par. 29, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait valoir qu\u2019en all\u00e9guant des hypoth\u00e8ses de fait, le ministre ne peut all\u00e9guer des conclusions de droit. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 que le ministre peut seulement pr\u00e9sumer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait d\u2019une conclusion mixte de fait et de droit de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que le contribuable sache exactement quelles hypoth\u00e8ses de fait il doit r\u00e9futer pour avoir gain de cause.\n[7] La question de r\u00e9sidence est une question qu\u2019une Cour tranche en se fondant sur l\u2019application de r\u00e8gles \u00e0 un ensemble de circonstances de sorte que la conclusion de r\u00e9sidence ou de non-r\u00e9sidence est une conclusion de droit fond\u00e9e sur un ensemble de faits. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante que les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre comprennent une conclusion de droit. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 de supprimer les mots \u00ab personne non-r\u00e9sidente \u00bb des paragraphes 11 c) et d) de la r\u00e9ponse. Aux paragraphes 11 e) et f), les mots \u00ab personne non-r\u00e9sidente \u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9s et remplac\u00e9s par Sebastiana Trimarchi.\nLa requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de modifier le paragraphe 11e) de la r\u00e9ponse\n[8] L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de modifier le paragraphe 11 e) de la r\u00e9ponse afin de corriger les montants de loyer brut que l\u2019appelante a pay\u00e9s en 2011 et 2016. Avec le consentement de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante, la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. Par cons\u00e9quent, les montants exacts des loyers bruts vers\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011 \u00e0 2016 sont les suivants :\nAnn\u00e9e d\u2019imposition\nLoyer brut\n2011\n16 650 $\n2012\n33 650 $\n2013\n33 900 $\n2014\n33 900 $\n2015\n33 900 $\n2016\n22 600 $\nIII. Question en litige\n[9] La question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel consiste \u00e0 savoir si le ministre a eu raison d\u2019imposer l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII \u00e0 l\u2019appelante pour son omission de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les sommes qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de loyer \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la question est de savoir si l\u2019appelante a pay\u00e9 un loyer \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente de sorte qu\u2019elle est responsable de l\u2019omission de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer sur les revenus de location pour le compte de la personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\nIV. Contexte\n[10] David Siscoe est le locataire qui occupait l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 comme r\u00e9sidence personnelle. Il a d\u2019abord sign\u00e9 un bail pour les locaux avec Anjar Investments Ltd. (\u00ab Anjar \u00bb) en mai 1996. Joseph Trimarchi a sign\u00e9 le bail au nom d\u2019Anjar. M. Siscoe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait pay\u00e9 le loyer \u00e0 Joseph Trimarchi pendant un certain temps, mais qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, Joseph lui avait demand\u00e9 de payer dor\u00e9navant le loyer \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses fr\u00e8res.\n[11] Je fais remarquer que selon les renseignements d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 6), Anjar compte trois actionnaires, soit Joseph Trimarchi, Graziella Trimarchi et Sebastiana Trimarchi. Natalina Mandato Trimarchi est l\u2019administratrice d\u2019Anjar.\n[12] En janvier 2006, Anjar et Natalina Mandato Trimarchi ont vendu l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 3). M. Siscoe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il ne savait pas que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 depuis 2006.\n[13] En mai 2010, M. Siscoe a conclu un bail de trois ans pour l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 avec Sebastiana Trimarchi qui a sign\u00e9 en qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire. Dans la section d\u00e9signant la \u00ab propri\u00e9taire (locatrice) \u00bb, elle inscrit son adresse au 439, boul. de l\u2019\u00cele, \u00e0 Pincourt. Cependant, dans la section des signatures, juste au-dessus de la signature de M. Siscoe indiquant qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 le bail le 12 mai 2010 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, il est indiqu\u00e9 que Sebastiana Trimarchi a sign\u00e9 le bail le 1er mai 2010 en Italie. De plus, elle a fourni deux num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, un num\u00e9ro de Montr\u00e9al et un num\u00e9ro international. M. Siscoe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il doute fort qu\u2019il ait pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces num\u00e9ros. Je fais remarquer que le num\u00e9ro international est le num\u00e9ro auquel l\u2019auditrice a joint Sebastiana Trimarchi en octobre 2018 (pi\u00e8ce R-11).\n[14] M. Siscoe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait vu Sebastiana Trimarchi en personne trois ou quatre fois au cours des ann\u00e9es. Il l\u2019a vue en 2010 lorsqu\u2019elle est venue avec le bail, une fois en 2014 ou 2015 lorsqu\u2019elle est venue accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019enfants et une autre fois lorsqu\u2019elle est venue seule vers 2017. M. Siscoe a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les rencontres se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es sans incident.\n[15] M. Siscoe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2011, 391 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 payer le loyer de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 en son nom parce que [traduction] \u00ab c\u2019\u00e9tait plus facile du point de vue de la comptabilit\u00e9 \u00bb et que cela \u00e9tait comptabilis\u00e9 dans le compte de pr\u00eat aux actionnaires. Le compte bancaire de l\u2019entreprise montre que des ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 libell\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Sebastiana Trimarchi par 391 chaque mois \u00e0 partir de juillet 2011 jusqu\u2019en janvier 2016, le dernier relev\u00e9 bancaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve.\n[16] Peu de choses peuvent \u00eatre tir\u00e9es des courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre M. Siscoe et Sebastiana Trimarchi produits en preuve autre que le fait que son adresse de courriel se terminait par .it plut\u00f4t que par .ca ou .com et le fait qu\u2019un courriel contient un langage que M. Siscoe a reconnu comme tr\u00e8s probablement de l\u2019italien, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il parle italien, mais pas tr\u00e8s bien.\n[17] M. Siscoe a affirm\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que Sebastiana Trimarchi vivait en Italie ou au Canada. Il a reconnu que ni 391 ni lui n\u2019avaient retenu l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII.\nV. R\u00e9gime de la partie XIII\n[18] La partie XIII de la Loi pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve un imp\u00f4t sur certains types de revenus vers\u00e9s \u00e0 des personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes par une personne r\u00e9sidente du Canada. L\u2019article 212 est une disposition d\u2019assujettissement visant \u00e0 imposer une obligation de payer un imp\u00f4t de 25 % sur certaines sommes qu\u2019une personne non-r\u00e9sidente re\u00e7oit d\u2019un r\u00e9sident canadien. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 212(1)d) impose une obligation de payer un imp\u00f4t de 25 % sur le loyer brut pay\u00e9 pour utiliser ou obtenir le droit d\u2019utiliser, au Canada, tout bien appartenant \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\n[19] Afin d\u2019assurer la perception de l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable par une personne non-r\u00e9sidente, le paragraphe 215(1) de la Loi exige que le r\u00e9sident canadien retienne l\u2019imp\u00f4t et le remette au receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Dans les cas o\u00f9 un mandataire verse une somme \u00e0 la personne non-r\u00e9sidente au nom d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur, le paragraphe 215(2) exige que le mandataire retienne l\u2019imp\u00f4t et le remette. Aux termes du paragraphe 215(6), une personne qui omet de d\u00e9duire et de retenir l\u2019imp\u00f4t ainsi que la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 et les int\u00e9r\u00eats conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 227(8) et (8.3).\n[20] Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que l\u2019article 216 autorise une personne non-r\u00e9sidente \u00e0 choisir de payer l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie I sur le revenu net de location de biens immeubles au Canada plut\u00f4t que l\u2019imp\u00f4t au taux fixe de 25 % sur les loyers bruts. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tabli aux termes de la partie XIII et celui \u00e9tabli aux termes de la partie I est telle que le choix d\u00e9clenche un remboursement \u00e0 la personne non-r\u00e9sidente. Aucun choix de ce genre n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce avant les cotisations de 2018 \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019appelante.\n[21] Dans ses commentaires sur la partie XIII de la Loi, le professeur Krishna a d\u00e9fini le r\u00e9gime de la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t comme un [traduction] \u00ab compromis d\u00e9licat \u00bb et le [traduction] \u00ab seul moyen r\u00e9aliste d\u2019imposer le revenu des personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes qui n\u2019exploitent pas une entreprise au Canada \u00bb (Vern Krishna, Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2018), vol. 2, pages 580 et 581).\nVI. Les th\u00e8ses des parties\nLa th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelante\n[22] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII parce qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la conclusion du ministre selon laquelle Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente et que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sont suffisants pour d\u00e9montrer que Sebastiana Trimarchi vivait au Canada. Dans ces circonstances, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\n[23] En outre, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que pour que l\u2019article 215 s\u2019applique, le payeur r\u00e9sident canadien doit savoir que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. De plus, une interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle la connaissance ne joue pas de r\u00f4le dans l\u2019application de l\u2019article 215 engendrerait une injustice envers les locataires. Selon l\u2019appelante, puisque David Siscoe ne savait pas que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente, l\u2019article 215 ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 lui. Enfin, l\u2019appelante affirme que les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s ne devraient pas s\u2019appliquer parce que Sebastiana Trimarchi a activement dissimul\u00e9 son statut de personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\nLa th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 215(1), l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait tenue de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII sur le loyer pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019en application du paragraphe 215(6), l\u2019appelante est assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII, aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et aux int\u00e9r\u00eats connexes en application des paragraphes 227(8) et (8.3).\n[25] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelante selon lequel le ministre a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab indulgent \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Trimarchi, mais [traduction] \u00ab rigoureux \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelante, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tous avaient fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une cotisation comme le permet express\u00e9ment la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contribuable r\u00e9sident parce qu\u2019il a omis de retenir et de verser l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII et \u00e9tablir \u00e9galement une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contribuable non r\u00e9sident pour l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII. Pour appuyer sa th\u00e8se, elle a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Solomon c. La Reine, 2007 CCI 654, par. 9, dans laquelle la juge Miller, alors juge, a conclu que le paragraphe 215(6) ne transf\u00e8re pas le fardeau fiscal du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire non r\u00e9sident au payeur r\u00e9sident. \u00c0 mon avis, le paragraphe 215(6) ne transf\u00e8re pas non plus le fardeau du payeur r\u00e9sident au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire non r\u00e9sident, qui peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII.\nVII. Analyse\n[26] L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que pour que le paragraphe 215(6) s\u2019applique, il y a essentiellement trois conditions : i) un r\u00e9sident du Canada a omis de retenir et de verser l\u2019imp\u00f4t; ii) sur une somme imposable aux termes de la partie XIII; iii) une somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que personne ne conteste le fait que l\u2019appelante est une r\u00e9sidente du Canada et, en outre, qu\u2019elle a omis de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII sur le loyer pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s, notamment le grand livre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et les relev\u00e9s bancaires de l\u2019appelante, d\u00e9montrent clairement que l\u2019appelante a pay\u00e9 un loyer \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Je conclus que l\u2019appelante tombe sous le coup des exigences i) et ii) mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus en tant que r\u00e9sidente canadienne qui a effectu\u00e9 des paiements de loyer au nom de David Siscoe et qu\u2019elle a omis de faire la retenue et le paiement. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019article 215 sur lequel les parties sont en d\u00e9saccord est de savoir si Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada de 2011 \u00e0 2016.\nR\u00e9sidence\n[27] Les avocats des deux parties ont renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe Thomson v MNR, [1946] SCR 209, par. 47, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que le terme [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb ne correspond pas \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments invariables, il est plut\u00f4t tr\u00e8s souple et ses nuances nombreuses varient selon le contexte. Il est tout \u00e0 fait impossible d\u2019en donner une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise et applicable \u00e0 tous les cas. La Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 que la r\u00e9sidence [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9pend essentiellement du point jusqu\u2019auquel une personne s\u2019\u00e9tablit en pens\u00e9e et en fait, ou conserve ou centralise son mode de vie habituel avec son cort\u00e8ge de relations sociales, d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et de convenances, au lieu en question \u00bb (Thomson, par. 50).\n[28] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9tendu que la d\u00e9termination de la r\u00e9sidence peut \u00eatre complexe et a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de notre Cour Biya c. La Reine, 2020 CCI 113, pour illustrer tous les facteurs qu\u2019une Cour peut prendre en compte pour d\u00e9terminer un lieu de r\u00e9sidence. En examinant les facteurs pertinents aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9tendu que la Cour devrait conclure que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente du Canada vu ses liens avec ce pays et l\u2019absence de liens avec l\u2019Italie. L\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants d\u00e9montrent que Sebastiana Trimarchi avait des liens avec le Canada et constituent le fondement pour conclure qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente du Canada : [traduction]\n\u00b7 Sebastiana avait de la famille au Canada d\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant que sa m\u00e8re Natalina et son fr\u00e8re Joseph vivaient \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (pi\u00e8ce R-11 et transcription [sic] 14).\nPlusieurs documents indiquaient que Sebastiana avait une adresse au Canada. Par exemple :\no selon les renseignements d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Registraire des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec, son adresse comme actionnaire d\u2019Anjar indique une adresse de Montr\u00e9al, soit 4040, rue Jean-B.-Meilleur (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 6);\no l\u2019acte de vente de 2006 de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 par Anjar \u00e0 Sebastiana indique que son adresse est l\u2019unit\u00e9 1402, au 4175, rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 3);\no sur le bail conclu avec David Siscoe en 2010, Sebastiana indique avoir sign\u00e9 en Italie, mais donne une adresse \u00e0 Pincourt, Qu\u00e9bec (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 2);\n\u00b7 Sebastiana avait un compte bancaire au Canada, car les ch\u00e8ques de loyer \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans un compte de TD Canada Trust \u00e0 une succursale de Montr\u00e9al (pi\u00e8ce R-6);\n\u00b7 Sebastiana avait un num\u00e9ro d\u2019assurance sociale indiquant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9sidente du Canada \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 et il n\u2019y a aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sidente.\n[29] L\u2019avocat a reconnu que ces liens \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab peu de choses \u00bb et a ajout\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab mais c\u2019est tout ce que nous avons \u00bb (transcription, vol 2, [sic] 22). L\u2019avocat a soutenu que l\u2019appelante avait r\u00e9fut\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du ministre selon laquelle Sebastiana vivait en Italie, de sorte qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir sa cause.\n[30] En examinant la question de savoir si Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente du Canada, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de la v\u00e9rificatrice, Choumele Jiofack. Mme Jiofack a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019appelante et a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une v\u00e9rification secondaire \u00e0 celle de la v\u00e9rification principale de David Siscoe. La v\u00e9rification principale a men\u00e9 la v\u00e9rificatrice \u00e0 demander les relev\u00e9s de grand livre et du compte bancaire de l\u2019appelante. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des renseignements qui y sont contenus, la v\u00e9rificatrice a conclu que l\u2019appelante payait le loyer de David Siscoe \u00e0 Sebastiana Trimarchi et, en outre, que le loyer \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\n[31] Dans le cadre de ses proc\u00e9dures de v\u00e9rification, Mme Jiofack a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si Sebastiana Trimarchi, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des loyers, d\u00e9clarait ce revenu. Elle a d\u00e9couvert que Sebastiana Trimarchi poss\u00e9dait un num\u00e9ro d\u2019assurance sociale, mais n\u2019avait produit aucune d\u00e9claration d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et n\u2019avait trouv\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9claration de renseignements, comme celles li\u00e9es aux revenus d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. De plus, mise \u00e0 part l\u2019adresse fournie, soit le 1402-4175, Sainte-Catherine Ouest, le rapport Equifax demand\u00e9 par la v\u00e9rificatrice lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 avec la mention \u00ab vide \u00bb. Mme Jiofack a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 le registre foncier, elle n\u2019a pas pu trouver d\u2019immeuble, autre que l\u2019unit\u00e9 501, liant Sebastiana au Canada.\n[32] Gr\u00e2ce aux renseignements qu\u2019elle a obtenus aupr\u00e8s de membres de sa famille, Mme Jiofack a pu joindre Sebastiana Trimarchi en Italie. Je fais remarquer que le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone utilis\u00e9 est le m\u00eame que celui fourni par Sebastiana sur le bail qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 en 2010. Au cours de cette conversation, Sebastiana a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle vivait en Italie. Mme Jiofack a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune contestation ni aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur le fait que Sebastiana vivait en Italie et qu\u2019elles ont eu une discussion sur les obligations fiscales de Sebastiana en tant que personne non-r\u00e9sidente.\n[33] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale accordant une requ\u00eate en cautionnement pour d\u00e9pens relativement \u00e0 la demande de Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vue d\u2019obtenir le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du ministre refusant sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour produire des d\u00e9clarations de revenus conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 216 de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2015. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019objection de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante, mais avec son consentement, seule une partie de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que la partie admise en preuve d\u00e9montrait que, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son avocat, Sebastiana Trimarchi demandait le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision par laquelle le ministre avait rejet\u00e9 sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai de production en application de l\u2019article 216, une disposition qui s\u2019applique aux personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes.\n[34] En ce qui concerne l\u2019adresse au Canada que Sebastiana a indiqu\u00e9e sur l\u2019acte de vente de 2006 de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 que cela devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme sa v\u00e9ritable adresse puisque le notaire n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 l\u2019adresse et a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la vente. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet argument, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la Cour n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant que le notaire \u00e9tait tenu de v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 de son adresse en tant qu\u2019acheteuse de l\u2019unit\u00e9. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que les autres adresses au Canada fournies par Sebastiana Trimarchi pourraient \u00eatre des adresses aux fins de signification puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait des m\u00eames adresses que celles de parents. L\u2019adresse fournie \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que celle de Graziella Trimarchi sur les renseignements inscrits au Bureau du registraire des entreprises et la m\u00eame que celle de sa m\u00e8re sur l\u2019acte d\u2019achat et de vente de l\u2019unit\u00e9 501. Pour appuyer sa th\u00e8se selon laquelle ces adresses ne devraient pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9es comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant que Sebastiana Trimarchi vivait au Canada, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de notre Cour Kau c. La Reine, 2018 CCI 156, par. 20 \u00e0 22. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le juge Russell a conclu que les d\u00e9clarations relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence peuvent \u00eatre fausses, que ce soit intentionnel ou non, et ne devraient pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9es inconditionnellement lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de recherche pour savoir si l\u2019adresse fournie \u00e9tait une indication de la r\u00e9sidence. Je conclus que les d\u00e9clarations non solennelles de Sebastiana Trimarchi pour lesquelles il n\u2019y a eu aucune enqu\u00eate ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement concluantes quant \u00e0 ses adresses r\u00e9sidentielles au cours des ann\u00e9es pertinentes.\n[35] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve examin\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition pertinentes. Je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suivants comme r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs de la non-r\u00e9sidence de Sebastiana Trimarchi, sans ordre pr\u00e9cis :\nelle n\u2019a produit aucune d\u00e9claration d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et n\u2019avait aucune d\u00e9claration de renseignements indiquant des revenus comme des revenus d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats;\nl\u2019absence de tout lien avec un bien au Canada autre que l\u2019unit\u00e9 501 qui \u00e9tait lou\u00e9e;\nun rapport d\u2019Equifax \u00ab vide \u00bb;\nle num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone auquel la v\u00e9rificatrice l\u2019a jointe en Italie \u00e9tait le m\u00eame que celui qu\u2019elle a fourni sur le bail qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 avec David Siscoe en 2010;\nses d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 la v\u00e9rificatrice selon lesquelles elle vivait en Italie;\nles adresses qu\u2019elle a fournies sur divers documents n\u2019ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune enqu\u00eate et \u00e9taient les m\u00eames que celles des membres de la famille vivant au Canada;\nla demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du rejet par le ministre de sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai de production des d\u00e9clarations aux termes de l\u2019article 216 de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2015, une disposition qui s\u2019applique aux personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes;\nla correspondance par courriel entre elle et David Siscoe en 2014 et 2015 indiquant qu\u2019elle avait une adresse courriel italienne.\nExigence relative \u00e0 la connaissance pour l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII\n[36] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a soutenu que la connaissance est requise pour que le paragraphe 215(6) s\u2019applique. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il a soutenu que si le payeur ne sait pas que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est un non-r\u00e9sident, il ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 assumer les cons\u00e9quences de la partie XIII. Pour appuyer ses conclusions, l\u2019appelante s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision de notre Cour Curragh Inc c. R, 94 DTC 1894 (Curragh). En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision Curragh ne s\u2019applique pas aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour trois raisons : i) dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 un r\u00e9sident canadien qui \u00e9tait le mandataire de la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire non r\u00e9sidente et il n\u2019y a pas de mandataire dans le pr\u00e9sent appel; ii) dans la d\u00e9cision Curragh, le payeur savait effectivement que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente; (iii) le juge Mogan a affirm\u00e9 que 215(6) d\u00e9pendait de la connaissance du payeur, mais a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de trancher cette question pr\u00e9cise sur les faits de cette affaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision Curragh ne peut appuyer la th\u00e8se selon laquelle la connaissance est requise pour que le paragraphe 215(6) s\u2019applique.\n[37] L\u2019appelante a en outre soutenu qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle le paragraphe 215(6) s\u2019applique pour assujettir \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII un locataire qui ignore que la propri\u00e9taire est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente serait injuste et a pr\u00e9tendu que cela ne saurait traduire l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Elle a implor\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de choisir une interpr\u00e9tation sens\u00e9e, que les gens peuvent accepter, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation qui cause une injustice. L\u2019avocat a reconnu que le texte de la disposition ne comporte pas d\u2019exigence imposant au payeur d\u2019avoir connaissance que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune preuve de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[38] L\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de retenue et de paiement devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur la diligence raisonnable, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu dans la jurisprudence pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de certaines dispositions qui pr\u00e9voient une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Je suis d\u2019accord que la jurisprudence a toujours conclu qu\u2019un contribuable peut pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur la diligence raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certaines dispositions qui pr\u00e9voient une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, mais je ne suis pas d\u2019accord qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur la diligence raisonnable puisse \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019obligation en mati\u00e8re de retenue et de paiement aux termes du paragraphe 215 (6). Ce point de vue est \u00e9tay\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision du juge Hogan J.K. Reed Engineering Ltd c. La Reine, 2014 CCI 309, par. 17 dans laquelle il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab Le paragraphe 215(6) de la Loi est une disposition d\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t qui rend le payeur responsable du paiement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire si, au moment du paiement, le payeur omet de d\u00e9duire ou de retenir l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Par contre, le paragraphe 227(8) de la Loi est une disposition qui pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur la diligence raisonnable peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la seconde disposition, mais non la premi\u00e8re \u00bb. Il convient de rappeler que le paragraphe 227(8) de la Loi est une disposition qui pr\u00e9voit une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle en raison de l\u2019omission de retenir et de remettre toute somme exig\u00e9e par l\u2019article 215, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e pour soutenir la perception de l\u2019imp\u00f4t impos\u00e9 par la disposition d\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t. J\u2019ajouterai qu\u2019en tout \u00e9tat de cause, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 la diligence raisonnable ni d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[39] Pour r\u00e9sumer le raisonnement de l\u2019appelante, puisque David Siscoe ne savait pas que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune raison de le croire, l\u2019article 215 ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\n[40] L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que l\u2019obligation aux termes du paragraphe 215(6) ne d\u00e9pend pas du fait que le contribuable sache que des paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019en appliquant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique prescrite par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, il est clair qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de connaissance n\u2019est requis pour imposer une obligation aux termes du paragraphe 215(6).\n[41] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les commentaires du juge Mogan dans la d\u00e9cision Curragh, supra, par. 24 o\u00f9 il a affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019article 215 est clair et non ambigu. Aucune aide ne lui est n\u00e9cessaire quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Je vais n\u00e9anmoins examiner l\u2019historique de la disposition d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sous la forme du projet de loi 96 en 1933 (projet de loi C-96, Loi modifiant la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t de guerre sur le revenu, 4e session, 17e l\u00e9gislature, 1933, ch. 12 (premi\u00e8re lecture le 5 mai 1933). Selon les renseignements figurant au projet de loi 96, le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l\u2019article 215 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 pour soutenir l\u2019application de la disposition d\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t aux personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes, elle-m\u00eame applicable depuis 1923. En premi\u00e8re lecture, le projet de loi 96 disposait de ce qui suit : [traduction]\n12. L\u2019article vingt-sept de cette loi est modifi\u00e9 par l\u2019ajout des paragraphes suivants :\n\u00ab (3) Toute personne qui effectue un paiement, par quelque moyen que ce soit, \u00e0 une personne non-r\u00e9sidente au titre d\u2019une chose donn\u00e9e \u00e0 louer, lou\u00e9e ou utilis\u00e9e au Canada, ou au titre de redevances pour une chose utilis\u00e9e ou vendue au Canada, doit d\u00e9duire de chacun de ces paiements douze et un demi-pour cent de celui-ci.\n(4) Le montant ainsi d\u00e9duit est remis au receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada en m\u00eame temps que le paiement est effectu\u00e9 ou port\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit de la personne non-r\u00e9sidente et est accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9claration sous la forme prescrite par le ministre [\u2026] \u00bb.\n12. Le pr\u00e9sent article est une disposition habilitante pour appuyer l\u2019article 27 de la Loi, en vertu duquel toutes les personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes depuis 1923 sont assujetties \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu canadien sur tous les loyers et toutes les redevances. Les dispositions de cet article 27 \u00e9dict\u00e9es en 1924 et applicables \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019imposition de 1923 dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles traitent des locations et des redevances sont libell\u00e9es ainsi;\n\u00ab 27 [\u2026]. Ou toute personne non-r\u00e9sidente qui donne \u00e0 louer ou loue une chose utilis\u00e9e au Canada ou qui re\u00e7oit une redevance ou un autre paiement semblable pour une chose utilis\u00e9e ou vendue au Canada, est r\u00e9put\u00e9e exploiter une entreprise au Canada et gagner une partie proportionnelle du revenu qui en sont d\u00e9riv\u00e9s au Canada \u00bb.\nLa difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer cet article est que, bien que les personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes soient assujetties \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les loyers et les redevances depuis 1923, dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, ces personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes ont apparemment pris tous les moyens possibles pour \u00e9viter de fournir des renseignements, de produire des d\u00e9clarations ou d\u2019admettre toute responsabilit\u00e9 aux termes de la Loi, m\u00eame si elles avaient droit \u00e0 un cr\u00e9dit dans leur propre pays \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tout imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pay\u00e9 au Canada. En retenant un pourcentage des loyers et des redevances \u00e0 la source, les personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes souhaiteront produire leur d\u00e9claration indiquant leur revenu de source canadienne, ainsi que les d\u00e9ductions au titre des d\u00e9penses applicables \u00e0 ces revenus canadiens, afin que le montant exact de leur imp\u00f4t canadien puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, car un cr\u00e9dit appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer sera accord\u00e9 pour tout montant retenu et des rajustements seront apport\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence.\n[42] L\u2019ancien paragraphe 215(6), ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi en 1960 en vertu du paragraphe 109(5) (Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C., 1952, ch. 148 dans sa version modifi\u00e9e par 1960, ch. 43, paragraphe 29(2)) est pratiquement identique \u00e0 la version actuelle. Il n\u2019y avait aucune exigence relative \u00e0 la connaissance dans la disposition relative \u00e0 la retenue lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois et aucune n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e au texte depuis. De plus, lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur veut limiter l\u2019assujettissement d\u2019un r\u00e9sident aux circonstances dont il a une connaissance ou une croyance, il le fait express\u00e9ment. Le paragraphe 116(5) en est un exemple.\n[43] Relativement \u00e0 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelante qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur la diligence raisonnable peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e, mais bien s\u00fbr, cette d\u00e9fense doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie. L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a fait preuve de diligence raisonnable pour s\u2019assurer du respect de ses obligations. Les Cours ont conclu que pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 opposer une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019imposition d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, on s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que le contribuable qui cherche \u00e0 invoquer une d\u00e9fense de diligence raisonnable doive d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a fait preuve de toute la diligence possible pour se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations en vertu de la Loi (voir par exemple, Ogden Palladium Services (Canada) Inc c. La Reine, 2001 DTC 345). Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pris aucune mesure pour s\u2019assurer du respect de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de retenue. L\u2019avocat a soutenu que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de ne pas prendre de mesures pour s\u2019assurer de la conformit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune raison de croire que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. Malheureusement, cela ne suffit pas pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme d\u2019un haut degr\u00e9 de diligence. Je conclus donc que le ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d\u2019imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 227(8) de la Loi.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[44] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le paragraphe 215(6) n\u2019exige pas que le payeur sache que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente. La disposition \u00e9nonce clairement que lorsqu\u2019une personne a omis de faire les d\u00e9ductions et les remises comme pr\u00e9vu, elle est assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII. Ayant conclu que Sebastiana Trimarchi \u00e9tait une personne non-r\u00e9sidente au cours des ann\u00e9es pertinentes et que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a omis de retenir et de remettre l\u2019imp\u00f4t de 25 % \u00e0 payer sur le loyer qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9, l\u2019appelante est assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII. De plus, l\u2019appelante est passible des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et des int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9vus aux paragraphes 227(8) et (8.3).\n[45] Mon examen du r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la partie XIII de la Loi m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il contient un ensemble int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de dispositions visant \u00e0 imposer les personnes non-r\u00e9sidentes sur des revenus comme les loyers et \u00e0 assurer la perception de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u00fb. Comme l\u2019a soutenu l\u2019appelante, la partie XIII peut avoir de graves cons\u00e9quences, et dans certains cas, plus encore que dans d\u2019autres. Toutefois, au regard de l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime, je suis convaincu que le paragraphe 215(6) est cens\u00e9 s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 imposer une obligation au payeur r\u00e9sident, comme l\u2019appelante, qui a omis de faire la retenue et le versement.\n[46] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 30e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Gabrielle St-Hilaire \u00bb\nLa juge St-Hilaire\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 37\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-1804(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\n3792391 CANADA INC., ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 8 mars 2023\nLe 13 mars 2023\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT :\nL\u2019honorable juge Gabrielle St-Hilaire\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 30 mars 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocat de l\u2019appelante :\nMe Hong Ky (Eric) Luu\nAvocates de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe Samantha Jackmino\nMe Janie Payette\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelante :\nNom :\nMe Hong Ky (Eric) Luu\nCabinet :\nHKL Tax Law\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada Ottawa, Canada",

APER\u00c7U\n[1] Mme Wan interjette appel aupr\u00e8s de notre Cour des nouvelles cotisations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) en application de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), qui a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019une partie des d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 et de promotion (les \u00ab d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 \u00bb) de Mme Wan \u2013 la partie refus\u00e9e \u00e9tant de 59 800 $ en 2016 et de 58 000 $ en 2017 \u2013 dans le calcul de son revenu d\u2019emploi. J\u2019utiliserai l\u2019expression \u00ab ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition \u00bb pour d\u00e9signer les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017.\n[2] Le ministre est d\u2019avis que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es par Mme Wan ou, subsidiairement, si elles l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es dans le but de gagner un revenu d\u2019emploi; elles ne sont donc pas d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul de son revenu d\u2019emploi. Le ministre a autoris\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019autres d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 et de promotion totalisant 32 493 $ en 2016 et 17 602 $ en 2017.\n[3] Durant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition, Mme Wan travaillait comme conseill\u00e8re en services \u00e0 la famille pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Service Corporation International (Canada). Ses fonctions consistaient notamment \u00e0 conclure des accords pour des biens ou des services de cimeti\u00e8re pour des familles-clients, \u00e0 vendre des accords de pr\u00e9voyance pour des cimeti\u00e8res et des salons fun\u00e9raires, \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et \u00e0 consolider des relations en vue de recruter de nouveaux clients potentiels, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9tablir et \u00e0 maintenir de solides relations d\u2019affaires avec les familles-clients. Mme Wan a obtenu de tr\u00e8s bons r\u00e9sultats durant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition; son revenu d\u2019emploi, avec les commissions, a totalis\u00e9 400 333 $ (dont 355 905 $ provenaient de commissions) en 2016 et 446 845 $ (dont 412 887 $ provenaient de commissions) en 2017.\n[4] Les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 concernent des services qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 Mme Wan par des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9tenues \u00e0 cent pour cent par son \u00e9poux et sa fille. En 2016, Mme Wan a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 et de promotion totalisant 29 900 $ pour des services rendus par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui appartenait \u00e0 son \u00e9poux et 29 900 $ pour des services rendus par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 sa fille. En 2017, Mme Wan a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 et de promotion totalisant 29 000 $ pour des services rendus par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 son \u00e9poux et 29 000 $ pour des services rendus par une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 sa fille.\n[5] Mme Wan est la seule personne qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nII. LA QUESTION EN LITIGE ET LES DISPOSITIONS PERTINENTES DE LA LOI\n[6] La question en litige est de savoir si les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 sont d\u00e9ductibles aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)f) de la Loi dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019emploi de Mme Wan.\n[7] Les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es comme suit :\n8 (1) Sont d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable tir\u00e9, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi ceux des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants qui se rapportent enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 cette source de revenus, ou la partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants qu\u2019il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer comme s\u2019y rapportant :\n[\u2026]\nf) lorsque le contribuable a \u00e9t\u00e9, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, employ\u00e9 pour remplir des fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la vente de biens ou \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation de contrats pour son employeur, et lorsque, \u00e0 la fois :\n(i) il \u00e9tait tenu, en vertu de son contrat, d\u2019acquitter ses propres d\u00e9penses,\n(ii) il \u00e9tait habituellement tenu d\u2019exercer les fonctions de son emploi ailleurs qu\u2019au lieu d\u2019affaires de son employeur,\n(iii) sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration consistait en tout ou en partie en commissions ou autres r\u00e9tributions semblables fix\u00e9es par rapport au volume des ventes effectu\u00e9es ou aux contrats n\u00e9goci\u00e9s,\n(iv) il ne recevait pas, relativement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, une allocation pour frais de d\u00e9placement qui, en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 6(1)b)(v), n\u2019\u00e9tait pas incluse dans le calcul de son revenu,\nles sommes qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pens\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour gagner le revenu provenant de son emploi (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence des commissions ou autres r\u00e9tributions semblables fix\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue au sous-alin\u00e9a (iii) et re\u00e7ues par lui au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e) dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces sommes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas :\n(v) des d\u00e9penses, des pertes ou des remplacements de capital ou des paiements au titre du capital, exception faite du cas pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a j),\n(vi) des d\u00e9penses qui ne seraient pas, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)l), d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e, si son emploi relevait d\u2019une entreprise exploit\u00e9e par lui;\n(vii) des montants dont le paiement a entra\u00een\u00e9 la r\u00e9duction du montant qui serait inclus par ailleurs dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e);\n[\u2026]\n(2) Seuls les montants pr\u00e9vus au pr\u00e9sent article sont d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable tir\u00e9, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi.\n[\u2026]\n(10) Un contribuable ne peut d\u00e9duire un montant pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition en application des alin\u00e9as (1)c), f), h) ou h.1) ou des sous-alin\u00e9as (1)i)(ii) ou (iii) que s\u2019il joint \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e un formulaire prescrit, sign\u00e9 par son employeur, qui atteste que les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 la disposition applicable ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies quant au contribuable au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[8] Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 que les exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux sous-alin\u00e9as 8(1)f)(i), (ii), (iii) et (iv) de la Loi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites et qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en litige dans les pr\u00e9sents appels. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que Mme Wan avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les formulaires T2200 prescrits au paragraphe 8(10) de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition, et que cette question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas non plus en litige dans les pr\u00e9sents appels.\nIII. CONCLUSION\n[9] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre en application de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition est rejet\u00e9, sans d\u00e9pens.\nIV. LES TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES\n(i) Mme Wan\n[10] Selon Mme Wan, les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es dans le but de gagner un revenu d\u2019emploi et elles devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul de son revenu d\u2019emploi. Mme Wan affirme plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que les meilleurs r\u00e9sultats qu\u2019elle a obtenus durant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition sont attribuables \u00e0 des services qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus par des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 son \u00e9poux et \u00e0 sa fille et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les d\u00e9penses \u00e9taient raisonnables.\n(ii) L\u2019intim\u00e9\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que Mme Wan n\u2019a pas engag\u00e9 ni effectu\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 en litige. Mme Wan n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9.\n[12] La preuve orale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019est pas suffisante pour r\u00e9futer les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre. Mme Wan a livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage vague et peu fiable et elle n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie d\u00e9montrant que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es.\n[13] Mme Wan devait tenir des registres et des livres de comptes en application du paragraphe 230(1) de la Loi. Les re\u00e7us qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve ne donnent pas une description des services rendus ni du mode de paiement, comme c\u2019est le cas habituellement des re\u00e7us fournis lors d\u2019op\u00e9rations commerciales. Aucune autre pi\u00e8ce justificative, par exemple des feuilles de temps, des relev\u00e9s bancaires, des ch\u00e8ques, des documents comptables, des relev\u00e9s des appels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits ou des d\u00e9tails sur les services rendus, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour corroborer la d\u00e9duction des d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e.\n[14] Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si la Cour devait conclure que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es, elles ne l\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le but de gagner un revenu d\u2019emploi.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande en outre \u00e0 la Cour de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que Mme Wan a omis de convoquer son \u00e9poux et sa fille \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il lui demande plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de conclure que les t\u00e9moignages de l\u2019\u00e9poux et de la fille auraient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par Mme Wan ou qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019emploi (Chaplin c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 194, par. 51).\nV. DISCUSSION\n[16] Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hickman Motors Ltd. c. Canada, [1997] 2 R.C.S. 336, aux paragraphes 92 \u00e0 95, le fardeau de la preuve, dans les appels en mati\u00e8re fiscale, incombe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Le fardeau de r\u00e9futer les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait formul\u00e9es par le ministre et de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les faits justifiant sa position, incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelant.\n[17] Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)f) de la Loi, sous r\u00e9serve de conditions qui ne sont pas en litige dans les pr\u00e9sents appels, \u00ab [\u2026] les sommes [que le contribuable] a d\u00e9pens\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour gagner le revenu provenant de son emploi [\u2026] \u00bb sont d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019emploi du contribuable. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Wan devait d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par elle et qu\u2019elles l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019emploi.\n[18] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que Mme Wan n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9. Son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019\u00e9tait ni convaincant ni cr\u00e9dible. Mme Wan aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter un t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et convaincant avec, dans la mesure du possible, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, pour d\u00e9montrer que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par elle. Je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[19] Qui plus est, l\u2019absence de la fille et de l\u2019\u00e9poux de Mme Wan \u00e0 l\u2019audience m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable, \u00e0 savoir que leur t\u00e9moignage respectif aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Mme Wan n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pour les services de marketing et de promotion all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[20] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Wan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Service Corporation International (Canada) en 2007. Son travail consistait essentiellement \u00e0 \u00e9largir ses relations avec la client\u00e8le et \u00e0 entrer en contact avec de nombreuses personnes. Elle a donc utilis\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodes pour commercialiser ses services et en faire la promotion. Mme Wan a non seulement fait para\u00eetre des annonces publicitaires dans les journaux, fait de publicit\u00e9 \u00e0 la radio et tenu des galas de charit\u00e9, mais elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait eu recours aux services de son \u00e9poux et de sa fille. La mort est une question d\u00e9licate et peu de personnes sont dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 en discuter. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Wan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9, en 2015, \u00e0 entreprendre des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un plus grand nombre d\u2019organismes et de groupes ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 assister \u00e0 davantage de r\u00e9ceptions pour attirer des clients. Elle a aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de communiquer avec d\u2019anciens clients pour savoir s\u2019ils aimeraient rediscuter de probl\u00e8mes. Elle a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019augmentation de ses d\u00e9penses de marketing et de publicit\u00e9 a entra\u00een\u00e9 une augmentation de ses ventes.\n[21] Des relev\u00e9s de compte des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de son \u00e9poux et de sa fille, pour les p\u00e9riodes prenant fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2016 et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2017 (pi\u00e8ces A-1 \u00e0 A-4), ainsi que des re\u00e7us \u00e9mis par ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Wan (pi\u00e8ces R-11, R-12, R-13 et R-15), ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve. Mme Wan a expliqu\u00e9 que sa fille lui avait fourni des services de marketing, lesquels services consistaient en l\u2019organisation d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements durant divers festivals et en l\u2019organisation de diverses campagnes dont Mme Wan \u00e9tait l\u2019h\u00f4te. Quant \u00e0 son \u00e9poux, Mme Wan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 durant son t\u00e9moignage que celui-ci avait fait plusieurs appels de sollicitation \u00e0 froid aupr\u00e8s de clients potentiels dans le but d\u2019accro\u00eetre ses ventes.\n[22] Cependant, Mme Wan n\u2019a produit aucun ch\u00e8que ni relev\u00e9 bancaire, ni aucun autre document \u00e0 l\u2019appui, indiquant que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es par elle. Qui plus est, Mme Wan n\u2019a produit aucune preuve de factures \u00e9tablies par ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, ni autres documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui tels qu\u2019une transcription des appels de sollicitation \u00e0 froid, une liste des appels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, des feuilles de temps ou une description des services rendus. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Wan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait certaine que sa fille et son \u00e9poux avaient rendu les services qu\u2019elle avait pay\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait donc pas \u00e0 exiger la production d\u2019autres documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui. De m\u00eame, elle n\u2019a conclu aucune entente de services officielle avec les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[23] Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir pay\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de sa fille et de son \u00e9poux. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, aucun document \u00e0 l\u2019appui, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des re\u00e7us et des relev\u00e9s de compte, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour. Je n\u2019ai accord\u00e9 aucun poids \u00e0 ce volet du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Wan, car il s\u2019agit d\u2019une preuve int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\n[24] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 notre Cour dans la d\u00e9cision DiCosmo c. La Reine, 2015 CCI 325 (confirm\u00e9e en 2017 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 2017 CAF 60) :\n[29] [...] La d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses d\u2019emploi par les contribuables doit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre appuy\u00e9e par des documents contemporains qui convaincront la Cour que les d\u00e9ductions sont fond\u00e9es. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. DiCosmo devait fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisants pour appuyer les d\u00e9ductions demand\u00e9es [...]. Je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage de M. DiCosmo est totalement insatisfaisant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[25] De plus, selon le paragraphe 230(1) de la Loi, Mme Wan doit tenir et conserver des renseignements et des documents d\u00e9taill\u00e9s pour \u00e9tayer ses pr\u00e9tentions selon lesquelles elle a elle-m\u00eame engag\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 et elle l\u2019a fait dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019emploi :\n230 (1) Quiconque exploite une entreprise et quiconque est oblig\u00e9, par ou selon la pr\u00e9sente loi, de payer ou de percevoir des imp\u00f4ts ou autres montants doit tenir des registres et des livres de comptes (y compris un inventaire annuel, selon les modalit\u00e9s r\u00e9glementaires) \u00e0 son lieu d\u2019affaires ou de r\u00e9sidence au Canada ou \u00e0 tout autre lieu que le ministre peut d\u00e9signer, dans la forme et renfermant les renseignements qui permettent d\u2019\u00e9tablir le montant des imp\u00f4ts payables en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou des imp\u00f4ts ou autres sommes qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9duites, retenues ou per\u00e7ues.\n[26] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Njenga v. The Queen, 96 DTC 6593, p. 6594 :\n[traduction] Le syst\u00e8me fiscal est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019autocontr\u00f4le. Il est d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que la charge de prouver le fondement des d\u00e9ductions et des r\u00e9clamations repose sur le contribuable. Le juge de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a tranch\u00e9 que les personnes comme la requ\u00e9rante doivent \u00eatre en mesure de produire toutes les informations et justifications permettant d\u2019appuyer les r\u00e9clamations qu\u2019elles font. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec cette conclusion. Mme Njenga, \u00e0 titre de contribuable, a la responsabilit\u00e9 de justifier ses affaires personnelles d\u2019une mani\u00e8re raisonnable. Des re\u00e7us \u00e9crits par elle-m\u00eame et des all\u00e9gations sans preuve ne sont pas suffisants.\n[27] Je tiens toutefois \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de fournir des pi\u00e8ces justificatives ou des re\u00e7us pour toutes les d\u00e9penses d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9ductions, \u00e0 condition que ces d\u00e9penses soient \u00e9tablies au moyen d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve cr\u00e9dibles (voir McMillan c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 393; Chrabalowski c. La Reine, 2004 CCI 644).\n[28] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le contribuable pr\u00e9sente chaque re\u00e7u, mais le contribuable devrait avoir \u00e0 prouver tout d\u2019abord, par d\u2019autres moyens cr\u00e9dibles, que les d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es et qu\u2019elles l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019emploi. Mme Wan a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[29] Mme Wan r\u00e9ussit bien dans son travail de vendeuse : elle fait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de la publicit\u00e9 dans les journaux locaux, \u00e0 la radio ainsi que lors d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements de bienfaisance. Elle tient habituellement des documents d\u00e9taill\u00e9s pour corroborer la d\u00e9duction de ses d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019exception des re\u00e7us et des relev\u00e9s de compte, elle n\u2019a tenu aucun document indiquant que les sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es pour les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 en litige. Je juge que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont insuffisants pour \u00e9tayer la d\u00e9duction des d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e.\n[30] Lorsque j\u2019examine la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, je peux tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences, de l\u2019attitude et du comportement du t\u00e9moin, des motifs qu\u2019aurait le t\u00e9moin pour rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage et de la \u00ab teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve \u00bb. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la juge Valerie Miller dans la d\u00e9cision Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334, 2009 DTC 1203 au paragraphe 23 :\n[23] En mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je peux tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses que comporte le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins, y compris les incoh\u00e9rences internes (si le t\u00e9moignage change pendant que le t\u00e9moin est \u00e0 la barre ou s\u2019il diverge du t\u00e9moignage rendu \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable), les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences externes (soit lorsque le t\u00e9moignage est incompatible avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ind\u00e9pendants que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9s). Il m\u2019est ensuite loisible d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attitude et le comportement du t\u00e9moin. Troisi\u00e8mement, je peux rechercher si le t\u00e9moin a des raisons de rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur. Enfin, je peux prendre en compte la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve. C\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que j\u2019ai toute latitude pour rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[31] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la suffisance de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience sont d\u00e9terminantes (Landry c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 399, 2009 DTC 1359, par. 47; Roy c. La Reine, 2006 DTC 226, 2008 CCI 3224). J\u2019ai \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re raisonnable global des nouvelles cotisations pour d\u00e9cider si je devais accueillir ou non les pr\u00e9sents appels.\n[32] J\u2019ai tenu compte de ces principes pour appr\u00e9cier la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audition des pr\u00e9sents appels et, pour les motifs pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, je conclus qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve cr\u00e9dible n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour \u00e9tayer la th\u00e8se de Mme Wan. Qui plus est, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent que, durant les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition, la fille de Mme Wan \u00e9tait \u00e9tudiante \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique, o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait inscrite \u00e0 un baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts. Il ne m\u2019appara\u00eet pas cr\u00e9dible que la fille de Mme Wan puisse avoir rendu les services all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Wan alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait inscrite \u00e0 un baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts.\n[33] Enfin, une conclusion d\u00e9favorable peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e du fait qu\u2019une partie n\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, notamment si le t\u00e9moignage aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 essentiel pour \u00e9tablir un fait important (Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. c. Canada, 2011 CAF 79, par. 14).\n[34] \u00c0 l\u2019affaire en instance, les t\u00e9moignages de l\u2019\u00e9poux et de la fille de Mme Wan auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une importance capitale pour \u00e9tablir que leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont bel et bien re\u00e7u les sommes en litige. Je n\u2019ai toutefois re\u00e7u aucune explication cr\u00e9dible justifiant leur absence \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je dois donc tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable de leur d\u00e9faut de compara\u00eetre et du fait que leurs t\u00e9moignages auraient montr\u00e9 que les d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par Mme Wan.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec), ce 3e jour d\u2019avril 2023.\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nLa juge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 38\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-1331(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nANNA WAI MAN WAN c.

Introduction\/question en litige : [1] Le pr\u00e9sent appel est interjet\u00e9 en application de deux lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. L\u2019appelante, Co-operative Hail Insurance Company Limited (\u00ab Co-op Hail \u00bb), interjette appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue le 25 janvier 2019 par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb).\n[2] La d\u00e9cision du ministre visait \u00e0 confirmer une d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) rendue le 23 novembre 2018, selon laquelle, au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 1er avril au 30 septembre 2016, un particulier, M. Casey Yeomans, avait effectu\u00e9 du travail en tant qu\u2019expert en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9 pour Co-op Hail \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9, et non d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n[3] La d\u00e9cision selon laquelle M. Yeomans avait travaill\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que comme entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant a eu pour effet de d\u00e9terminer que M. Yeomans occupait un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension aupr\u00e8s de Co-op Hail pendant ladite p\u00e9riode, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)a) du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, et qu\u2019il occupait \u00e9galement un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s de Co-op Hail, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[4] Dans son appel, Co-op Hail soutient que le ministre a commis une erreur en concluant que M. Yeomans avait travaill\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 de Co-op Hail et qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il avait effectu\u00e9 le travail en question pour Co-op Hail \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nII. Preuve : [5] Lors de l\u2019audience, deux t\u00e9moins ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9, MM. Yeomans et Daniel Anderson. En 2016, M. Anderson \u00e9tait directeur financier de Co-op Hail et en est actuellement le chef de la direction.\n[6] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9tabli que M. Yeomans \u00e9tait enseignant dans une \u00e9cole secondaire et directeur d\u2019\u00e9cole adjoint. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement titulaire d\u2019une licence d\u2019expert en gr\u00eale et travaillait \u00e0 ce titre pendant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris, aux fins du pr\u00e9sent appel, au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2016. M. Yeomans avait suivi une formation pour obtenir en 2012 une licence d\u2019expert en gr\u00eale aupr\u00e8s des Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan.\n[7] Un expert en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9 r\u00e8gle les demandes de r\u00e8glement des producteurs de diverses r\u00e9coltes, telles que le bl\u00e9 et le canola, endommag\u00e9es par la gr\u00eale. L\u2019expert utilise les m\u00e9thodes auxquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer la valeur des pertes des r\u00e9coltes d\u2019un producteur caus\u00e9es par la gr\u00eale. Les producteurs pr\u00e9sentent des demandes de r\u00e8glement pour les pertes de r\u00e9coltes caus\u00e9es par la gr\u00eale \u00e0 la ou aux compagnies d\u2019assurance particuli\u00e8res, telles que Co-op Hail, avec lesquelles ils ont contract\u00e9 une assurance pour se prot\u00e9ger contre de tels dommages. L\u2019expert en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9 se rendra dans les champs du producteur sinistr\u00e9 et d\u00e9terminera la valeur du sinistre. L\u2019expert s\u2019efforcera d\u2019obtenir l\u2019accord du producteur sur la valeur perdue qu\u2019il a d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. La compagnie d\u2019assurance concern\u00e9e est tenue de verser, \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019assurance, la valeur perdue convenue.\n[8] Le 4 avril 2016, M. Yeomans et Co-op Hail ont conclu un \u00ab contrat ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019expertise en gr\u00eale \u00bb, pr\u00e9cisant que M. Yeomans travaillerait pour Co-op Hail en tant qu\u2019\u00ab entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant \u00bb, pour l\u2019expertise des sinistres li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019assurance gr\u00eale concernant les r\u00e9coltes.\n[9] Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune promesse quant \u00e0 la fr\u00e9quence ou au nombre de r\u00e8glements de sinistres pour lesquels Co-op Hail sollicitait les services de M. Yeomans. Il y \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Yeomans payait ses propres imp\u00f4ts sur le revenu et ses propres cotisations au R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, et que Co-op Hail n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable de ces paiements.\n[10] Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait en outre que Co-op Hail ne superviserait pas directement le travail proprement dit et ne donnerait pas d\u2019instructions \u00e0 M. Yeomans quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il devait s\u2019acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches de r\u00e8glement. M. Yeomans devait tenir Co-op Hail inform\u00e9e de l\u2019avancement des travaux et se conformer \u00e0 toute demande raisonnable de Co-op Hail concernant la documentation ou l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019avancement de certaines affectations de r\u00e8glement.\n[11] Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement que M. Yeomans devait d\u00e9cider des m\u00e9thodes et des moyens d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses services d\u2019expertise et qu\u2019il devait travailler dans le respect des exigences de sa licence provinciale d\u2019expert en sinistres dus \u00e0 la gr\u00eale. Dans le cadre de son travail de r\u00e8glement de sinistres, M. Yeomans devait se conformer aux pratiques et proc\u00e9dures d\u00e9crites dans le Crop Hail Adjustment Manual (manuel de r\u00e8glement des sinistres caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale des r\u00e9coltes), tel que r\u00e9glement\u00e9 par le Superintendent of Insurance (surintendant des assurances) de la Saskatchewan.\n[12] Les cycles de travail de M. Yeoman commen\u00e7aient un peu apr\u00e8s le passage d\u2019un orage de gr\u00eale qui avait endommag\u00e9 les r\u00e9coltes. C\u2019est le \u00ab responsable des intemp\u00e9ries \u00bb de l\u2019assureur des r\u00e9coltes de Co-op Hail (et peut-\u00eatre aussi les responsables des intemp\u00e9ries d\u2019autres assureurs) qui entrait en contact avec lui. Le responsable des intemp\u00e9ries avait en main diverses demandes de r\u00e8glement pour des dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale aux r\u00e9coltes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de Co-op Hail par des producteurs dont les r\u00e9coltes sont assur\u00e9es par Co-op Hail. Le responsable des intemp\u00e9ries demandait \u00e0 M. Yeoman de travailler en tant qu\u2019expert pour tout ou partie de ces sinistres.\n[13] M. Yeomans pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait r\u00e9gler les sinistres concernant les producteurs de la r\u00e9gion de Swift Current, que son travail soit proche de son lieu de r\u00e9sidence et que les p\u00e9riodes de travail n\u2019entrent pas en conflit avec l\u2019horaire d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de sa famille. Il choisissait en cons\u00e9quence les sinistres qu\u2019il acceptait de r\u00e9gler.\n[14] Au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2016, M. Yeomans (et d\u2019autres experts agr\u00e9\u00e9s) a accept\u00e9 les conditions de paiement de Co-op Hail, \u00e0 savoir 220 $ par jour pour le r\u00e8glement des r\u00e9coltes touch\u00e9es par la gr\u00eale pour Co-op Hail, plus 185 $ par jour pour la nourriture, l\u2019h\u00e9bergement et le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, et 75 $ par jour s\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 domicile ou s\u2019il rentrait chez lui \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 sur des sinistres, plus un montant fixe par kilom\u00e8tre pour l\u2019utilisation de son propre v\u00e9hicule.\n[15] M. Yeomans, comme les autres experts, devait utiliser son propre v\u00e9hicule pour les d\u00e9placements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son travail d\u2019expert, et fournir ses propres bottes, son imperm\u00e9able et son tulle pour moustiquaire. Co-op Hail fournissait des stylos et du papier (par exemple, les formulaires de demande de r\u00e8glement officiels), ainsi que le manuel que les experts en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9s de la Saskatchewan devaient respecter.\n[16] Comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 M. Yeomans en remplissant un questionnaire de l\u2019ARC, le travail d\u2019expertise des r\u00e9coltes touch\u00e9es consistait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab se rendre dans les champs, mesurer les dommages, compter les graines sur les plantes, \u00e9tablir des diagrammes, r\u00e9diger des notes, discuter avec l\u2019agriculteur ou l\u2019assur\u00e9 pour examiner la demande de r\u00e8glement et obtenir la signature [de la preuve de sinistre] de l\u2019agriculteur ou du membre \u00bb (Le terme \u00ab membre \u00bb fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que Co-op Hail \u00e9tait une coop\u00e9rative).\n[17] En outre, en tant qu\u2019expert en sinistres agr\u00e9\u00e9 sur les dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale, M. Yeomans, \u00e9tait libre d\u2019effectuer un travail similaire pour d\u2019autres compagnies d\u2019assurance, et pas seulement pour Co-op Hail, lesquelles pouvaient \u00e9galement chercher \u00e0 l\u2019engager pour ce type de travail. Le travail que M. Yeomans a accept\u00e9 \u00e9tait son choix, y compris celui d\u2019accepter de r\u00e9gler la totalit\u00e9 ou moins de la totalit\u00e9 des sinistres n\u00e9cessitant un r\u00e8glement propos\u00e9s par les responsables des intemp\u00e9ries de toutes les autres compagnies d\u2019assurance r\u00e9colte, y compris Co-op Hail.\n[18] Si un assureur r\u00e9colte ne souhaitait pas travailler avec un expert particulier, le responsable des intemp\u00e9ries de cet assureur cessait simplement de contacter cet expert pour discuter de l\u2019attribution des sinistres \u00e0 r\u00e9gler.\nIII. Droit : [19] Plusieurs d\u00e9cisions importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9laboration des fondements juridiques canadiens permettant de distinguer les employ\u00e9s des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants. Pendant des ann\u00e9es, la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.R.N., [1986] 3 C.F. 553 de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En 1986, l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door a adopt\u00e9 un \u00ab crit\u00e8re quatre en un \u00bb, s\u2019inspirant de la jurisprudence anglaise pour faire la distinction entre un \u00ab contrat de louage de services \u00bb (employ\u00e9s) et un \u00ab contrat d\u2019entreprise \u00bb (entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants). Dans le cas de l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door, les quatre facteurs d\u00e9terminants cern\u00e9s sont (i) le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le sur la mani\u00e8re dont le travail doit \u00eatre accompli, (ii) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des outils, (iii) la possibilit\u00e9 de profits et (iv) les risques de perte.\n[20] En 2001, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 CSC 59, a \u00e9tabli que la question centrale \u00e9tait de savoir si la personne engag\u00e9e pour travailler exer\u00e7ait ou non une activit\u00e9 commerciale pour son propre compte. L\u2019arr\u00eat Sagaz a \u00e9galement cern\u00e9 des indices, largement conformes \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door, \u00e0 savoir le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le des activit\u00e9s du travailleur, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quipement, la possibilit\u00e9 pour le travailleur d\u2019embaucher des aides, le degr\u00e9 de risque financier, le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019investissement et de gestion, et la possibilit\u00e9 pour le travailleur de r\u00e9aliser des profits dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[21] En 2013, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) c. Canada (Revenu national), 2013 CAF 85 (\u00ab Connor Homes \u00bb), a \u00e9tabli un processus en deux \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9terminer si le particulier fournissait des services commerciaux pour son propre compte. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consistait \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier l\u2019intention subjective des parties quant \u00e0 la nature de la relation de travail. La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape consistait \u00e0 examiner divers facteurs objectifs tels qu\u2019ils sont recens\u00e9s dans les arr\u00eats Wiebe Door et Sagaz \u00e0 travers le prisme de l\u2019intention subjective des parties, afin de v\u00e9rifier si cette intention s\u2019est concr\u00e9tis\u00e9e.\nIV. Discussion : [22] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelante Co-op Hail invoque en particulier l\u2019affaire Wray Agencies Ltd. c. M.R.N., 2003 CCI 428, tranch\u00e9e par le juge suppl\u00e9ant Rowe de notre Cour en 2003, qui pr\u00e9sente des faits similaires. Dans la d\u00e9cision Wray, l\u2019assureur appelant vendait de l\u2019assurance contre les dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale en Saskatchewan et le travailleur, William Skene, \u00e9tait un expert en sinistres agr\u00e9\u00e9 sur les dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale qui effectuait des travaux d\u2019expertise pour l\u2019assureur appelant. M. Skene recevait des honoraires journaliers et des frais connexes pour effectuer son travail de r\u00e8glement des sinistres. Il n\u2019avait pas de contrat \u00e9crit avec l\u2019assureur appelant.\n[23] Dans la d\u00e9cision Wray, la Cour a examin\u00e9 les indices \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sagaz. En ce qui concerne le \u00ab degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le \u00bb, M. Skene avait parfois travaill\u00e9 comme expert agr\u00e9\u00e9 pour un autre assureur. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019assister \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence annuelle des experts en sinistres. M. Skene \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019utiliser le manuel de r\u00e8glement des sinistres approuv\u00e9 par le secteur. M. Skene pouvait fixer ses propres horaires de travail, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de se pr\u00e9senter chez l\u2019appelante et \u00e9tait libre d\u2019accepter ou de refuser le travail que lui proposait l\u2019entreprise appelante.\n[24] En ce qui concerne la \u00ab fourniture d\u2019\u00e9quipement ou d\u2019aides \u00bb dans la d\u00e9cision Wray, l\u2019entreprise appelante fournissait un expert suppl\u00e9mentaire en cas de besoin, sans frais pour M. Skene. D\u2019autres aides pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es par M. Skene, \u00e0 ses propres frais, bien que cela n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au cours de la p\u00e9riode concern\u00e9e. L\u2019entreprise appelante fournissait des stylos et le papier n\u00e9cessaire, un bloc-notes et le manuel \u00e0 suivre. M. Skene fournissait son v\u00e9hicule et les v\u00eatements n\u00e9cessaires pour travailler dans les champs.\n[25] En ce qui concerne le \u00ab degr\u00e9 de risque financier et le degr\u00e9 de responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019investissement et de gestion \u00bb, M. Skene recevait ses honoraires journaliers et ses d\u00e9penses, y compris une indemnit\u00e9 au kilom\u00e8tre pour couvrir les d\u00e9penses d\u2019automobile. Il lui appartenait de g\u00e9rer son temps et de disposer d\u2019un bureau \u00e0 domicile, quel qu\u2019il soit, pour pouvoir fournir ses services de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate.\n[26] Enfin, en ce qui concerne la \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pour le travailleur de r\u00e9aliser des profits dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches \u00bb, la Cour a not\u00e9 que la possibilit\u00e9 pour M. Skene de gagner plus d\u2019argent \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019accepter plus de travail et d\u2019\u00eatre efficace dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches d\u2019expert en sinistres afin que, pendant la courte saison de travail, plus de demandes puissent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Je ne suis pas enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec ce dernier point, car M. Skene n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019un r\u00e8glement par sinistre, mais selon des honoraires journaliers. Il r\u00e9alisait donc des profits en acceptant plus de travail, ce qui se traduisait par un plus grand nombre de jours de travail et donc un salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[27] Dans la d\u00e9cision Wray, le juge a pris note des propos du juge No\u00ebl (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wolf c. Canada, 2002 D.T.C. 6853, selon lesquels \u00ab [...] dans une issue serr\u00e9e comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si les facteurs pertinents pointent dans les deux directions avec autant de force, l\u2019intention contractuelle des parties et en particulier leur compr\u00e9hension mutuelle de la relation ne peuvent pas \u00eatre laiss\u00e9es de c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[28] Le juge suppl\u00e9ant Rowe a not\u00e9 que M. Skene disposait d\u2019une grande libert\u00e9 quant au moment o\u00f9 il pouvait effectuer son travail, et quant au fait d\u2019accepter ou non ce travail, au cours d\u2019une courte p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait libre de fixer des rendez-vous avec les agriculteurs. Il pouvait organiser son propre emploi du temps de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir d\u00e9cider s\u2019il pouvait ou non accepter un travail suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[29] M. Skene travaillait-il pour son propre compte, selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Sagaz? Le juge suppl\u00e9ant Rowe a estim\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, en l\u2019absence de toute \u00ab incongruit\u00e9 flagrante \u00bb dans l\u2019ensemble des circonstances indiquant le contraire :\nRien n\u2019indique que M. Skene n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat et capable de fournir ses services ou qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 et satisfait de le faire dans ces circonstances [c.-\u00e0-d. que M. Skene exer\u00e7ait ses activit\u00e9s pour son propre compte]. Il n\u2019y a aucune incongruit\u00e9 flagrante dans l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de la relation de travail analys\u00e9e qui permette de mettre en doute la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de la description de la relation fournie par le travailleur et l\u2019appelante dans les appels qui nous occupent.\n[30] Dans la d\u00e9cision Wray, la Cour a conclu que M. Skene travaillait en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n[31] Presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, le juge suppl\u00e9ant Rowe a statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019affaire McQueen Agencies Limited c. M.R.N., 2003 CCI 430. L\u2019affaire \u00e9tait similaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Wray, et concernait le travailleur Ben Buchinski. L\u00e0 encore, l\u2019entreprise appelante vendait de l\u2019assurance contre les dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale en Saskatchewan. M. Buchinski \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent de M. Skene dans la mesure o\u00f9 il travaillait avec l\u2019appelante en tant qu\u2019expert en sinistres stagiaire, supervis\u00e9 par des experts en chef. Il \u00e9tait contact\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre par le directeur de l\u2019appelante pour l\u2019informer de ses progr\u00e8s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019apprentissage.\n[32] M. Buchinski \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant sous le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019entreprise appelante parce que, contrairement \u00e0 M. Skene, un expert en sinistres exp\u00e9riment\u00e9, M. Buchinski s\u2019\u00e9tait joint \u00e0 la compagnie d\u2019assurance contre les dommages caus\u00e9s par la gr\u00eale pour \u00eatre form\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019expert en sinistres. Il ne savait pas encore comment exercer le travail d\u2019expert en sinistres.\n[33] En outre, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de retenir les services d\u2019aides. Il ne pouvait pas encore fournir des services d\u2019expertise en personne, mais il aidait les experts en chef. Il ne pouvait pas g\u00e9rer son propre emploi du temps parce qu\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 tout moment sous la supervision directe d\u2019un expert en chef.\n[34] La Cour a conclu que M. Buchinski n\u2019avait pas la capacit\u00e9 de travailler au niveau exig\u00e9 d\u2019une personne capable de fournir des services de r\u00e8glement de sinistres pour son propre compte. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 et la conclusion du ministre selon laquelle M. Buchinski \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e.\n[35] S\u2019agissant de la Couronne intim\u00e9e, l\u2019avocat a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision AE Hospitality Ltd. c. M.R.N., 2019 CCI 116, tranch\u00e9e par la juge D\u2019Auray de notre Cour. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019entreprise appelante avait engag\u00e9 des superviseurs, des serveurs, des barmans et des chefs pour des traiteurs. Ces personnes \u00e9taient-elles des employ\u00e9s ou des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants? La Cour a conclu que l\u2019appelante et les traiteurs avaient mis en place des m\u00e9canismes qui permettaient d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur les travailleurs, quelle que soit leur exp\u00e9rience, pour des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de petite ou de grande envergure. L\u2019appelante et les traiteurs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas seulement pr\u00e9sents pour assurer la coordination. Ils avaient l\u2019autorit\u00e9 r\u00e9siduelle de donner des instructions au personnel, si cela s\u2019av\u00e9rait n\u00e9cessaire, sur ce qu\u2019il fallait faire et la fa\u00e7on de le faire.\n[36] L\u2019appelante choisissait \u00e9galement les personnes \u00e0 qui l\u2019on proposait des quarts de travail pour les \u00e9v\u00e9nements et d\u00e9cidait des fonctions qu\u2019occupait le personnel de service. Les premiers chefs s\u00e9lectionnaient les chefs qui travaillaient lors d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement donn\u00e9. Ces facteurs de contr\u00f4le ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme indiquant une relation d\u2019emploi.\n[37] En ce qui concerne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des outils, tels que les d\u00e9capsuleurs, les outils de service aux bars, les tabliers, etc., \u00e0 l\u2019exception des articles de bar, l\u2019appelante mettait toujours ces articles \u00e0 disposition. La juge D\u2019Auray a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un facteur neutre.\n[38] En ce qui concerne la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 de profits et le risque de perte \u00bb telle qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9crite par la Cour, celle-ci a conclu que le fait de travailler plus ou moins d\u2019heures n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 une possibilit\u00e9 de profits ou \u00e0 un risque de perte. Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord. En ce qui concerne la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 de profits \u00bb, il me semble que dans la mesure o\u00f9 des heures ou des quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires sont facilement disponibles pour \u00eatre travaill\u00e9s si le travailleur le souhaite, celui-ci est en mesure de gagner plus rapidement un profit ne d\u00e9coulant pas d\u2019un travail d\u2019entrepreneur, en ce sens qu\u2019il peut gagner des fonds exc\u00e9dant le montant de certaines ou de toutes les d\u00e9penses.\n[39] Toutefois, en ce qui concerne le \u00ab risque de perte \u00bb, il est difficile de conceptualiser une diminution du risque dans le contexte d\u2019une r\u00e9duction ou d\u2019une augmentation du nombre d\u2019heures de travail. D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door, ces facteurs \u2013 (i) la possibilit\u00e9 de profits et (ii) le risque de perte \u2013 sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, ce qui indique qu\u2019ils doivent \u00eatre pris en compte individuellement, et non pas conjointement comme dans la d\u00e9cision AE Hospitality.\n[40] Les circonstances de la d\u00e9cision AE Hospitality ne sont pas comparables \u00e0 celles de l\u2019affaire en instance. Co-op Hail n\u2019exerce pas le m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le sur les experts en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9s. M. Yeomans dispose d\u2019une grande souplesse dans le choix du travail de r\u00e8glement des sinistres qu\u2019il effectuera, y compris o\u00f9 et quand. Le fait qu\u2019il doive suivre les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans un manuel pour r\u00e9gler les dommages caus\u00e9s aux r\u00e9coltes est une attente du secteur applicable aux experts en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9s en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cela n\u2019indique pas qu\u2019il y a un contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par Co-op Hail.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gagnon c. Canada (Revenu national), 2007 CAF 33. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t qui avait examin\u00e9 le statut professionnel de 11 applicateurs de cloisons s\u00e8ches, engag\u00e9s verbalement par un autre applicateur de cloisons s\u00e8ches lorsque celui-ci avait un exc\u00e8s de travail. Deux des onze applicateurs \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce et les neuf autres \u00e9taient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019heure. La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t avait conclu que ces travailleurs \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s, car leur investissement individuel dans ce travail \u00e9tait minime, d\u2019autant plus que l\u2019applicateur qui les engageait leur fournissait de nombreux outils et fournitures, m\u00eame si, dans leur propre travail, ils utilisaient normalement leurs propres outils.\n[42] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est dite d\u2019accord avec la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a observ\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019avaient pas port\u00e9 sur la question du contr\u00f4le. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9 que le contr\u00f4le avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 par le travailleur charg\u00e9 de l\u2019embauche, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le contr\u00f4le \u00e9tait l\u2019une des hypoth\u00e8ses de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait donc pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 exact, car il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement.\n[43] Enfin, la Couronne intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Maliyar c. La Reine, 2006 CCI 671, rendue par le juge Hershfield. Dans cette affaire, le travailleur appelant, un ing\u00e9nieur en m\u00e9canique, a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un employ\u00e9. La Cour a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 employeuse pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le important sur le contribuable et son travail. Du travail lui \u00e9tait confi\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, avec des directives et des calendriers rigoureux. En outre, le contribuable devait utiliser les outils et les logiciels de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans ses locaux, m\u00eame s\u2019il disposait de ses propres logiciels.\n[44] La Cour a \u00e9galement estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de possibilit\u00e9 de profits ni de risque de perte puisque le contribuable gagnait un salaire horaire et n\u2019investissait pas de capital. De m\u00eame, le fait que le contribuable avait enregistr\u00e9 un nom commercial aux fins de la TPS n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il avait sa propre entreprise. Il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres clients et ne faisait pas de publicit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que l\u2019intention des parties quant au statut professionnel du contribuable n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire puisque les crit\u00e8res traditionnels \u00e9taient d\u00e9terminants en la mati\u00e8re.\n[45] En statuant sur le pr\u00e9sent appel interjet\u00e9 par Co-op Hail concernant M. Yeomans, je suis bien conscient qu\u2019en ce qui concerne la question de l\u2019employ\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions se sont accumul\u00e9es au fil des d\u00e9cennies depuis 1986, date de l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door. Les deux parties ont invoqu\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en instance.\n[46] J\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision appropri\u00e9e est d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel, en concluant que M. Yeomans \u00e9tait un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du ministre qui l\u2019a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un employ\u00e9. Ma d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur plusieurs motifs. Tout d\u2019abord, les parties ont tr\u00e8s clairement indiqu\u00e9 que telle \u00e9tait leur intention, au moyen de leur accord \u00e9crit du 4 avril 2016. Ainsi, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les circonstances factuelles sous l\u2019angle du point de vue subjectif des parties selon lequel le statut de travailleur de M. Yeomans par rapport \u00e0 Co-op Hail \u00e9tait celui d\u2019un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n[47] Je constate plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que Co-op Hail a exerc\u00e9 un contr\u00f4le n\u00e9gligeable sur le travail de M. Yeomans en tant qu\u2019expert en gr\u00eale agr\u00e9\u00e9. En effet, pour que le travail de r\u00e8glement en sinistres de M. Yeomans soit accept\u00e9 comme \u00e9quitable entre la compagnie d\u2019assurance d\u2019une part et le prestataire d\u2019assurance d\u2019autre part, M. Yeomans devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas simplement une extension ou une entit\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u2019assurance. M. Yeomans disposait d\u2019une grande libert\u00e9 dans le choix des sinistres d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de Co-op Hail qu\u2019il acceptait de r\u00e9gler, en fonction de consid\u00e9rations personnelles telles que la proximit\u00e9 de son domicile situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Swift Current.\n[48] En ce qui concerne la possession d\u2019outils, l\u2019\u00e9quipement fourni par la Co-op Hail \u00e9tait relativement simple \u2013 un stylo, du papier et une planchette \u00e0 pince. Co-op Hail fournissait \u00e9galement le manuel remis \u00e0 tous les experts en r\u00e9coltes agr\u00e9\u00e9s, \u00e9labor\u00e9 non pas par Co-op Hail elle-m\u00eame, mais par un organisme r\u00e9glement\u00e9 par la province. Ce n\u2019est donc pas Co-op Hail elle-m\u00eame qui contr\u00f4lait la mani\u00e8re dont le travail de r\u00e8glement en sinistres \u00e9tait effectu\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t le manuel, fourni g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aux experts en r\u00e9coltes agr\u00e9\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre au besoin \u00e9vident que les experts utilisent les m\u00eames m\u00e9thodologies dans leur travail de r\u00e8glement en sinistres.\n[49] En outre, M. Yeomans fournissait un outil substantiel, \u00e0 savoir son propre v\u00e9hicule pour se rendre dans les diff\u00e9rentes localit\u00e9s rurales de la Saskatchewan o\u00f9 il avait accept\u00e9 de travailler, examinant les r\u00e9coltes endommag\u00e9es de divers prestataires.\n[50] En ce qui concerne la possibilit\u00e9 de profits, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que j\u2019ai dit ci-dessus, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il y a des chances de prosp\u00e9rer (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de r\u00e9aliser des profits) en travaillant un nombre maximal de jours. L\u2019augmentation du revenu brut se traduirait par un accroissement raisonnable du revenu net. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019il existe un risque de perte particulier. Bien entendu, il existe toujours des risques th\u00e9oriques, comme la possibilit\u00e9 que M. Yeomans ait un accident de voiture en conduisant dans le cadre de son travail, ce qui l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de travailler.\n[51] En conclusion, je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Wray tranch\u00e9e par le juge suppl\u00e9ant Rowe, rendue il y a vingt ans. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision bien r\u00e9dig\u00e9e et bien motiv\u00e9e, qui traite de faits \u00e9tonnamment similaires.\n[52] Conform\u00e9ment aux motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, et compte tenu du principe de courtoisie judiciaire, j\u2019accueillerai l\u2019appel, estimant que M. Yeomans a fourni des services \u00e0 Co-op Hail pendant la p\u00e9riode de 2016 en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant exer\u00e7ant une activit\u00e9 commerciale, et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 de Co-op Hail. Ainsi, aux fins du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada et de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente de 2016, M. Yeomans n\u2019occupait pas d\u2019emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension ou assurable.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 6e jour d\u2019avril 2023.\n\u00ab B.

Question en litige\n[1] La question dont est saisie la Cour dans cette affaire est celle de savoir si les appelants ont droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement des appelants de leur ancienne r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption \u00e0 leur nouvelle r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al est vis\u00e9 par la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb.\nII. Introduction\n[2] Les appelants, St\u00e9phane Gaudet et Ann Sophie Del Vecchio, en appellent des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par la ministre du Revenu national (Ministre) en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, LRC (1985), c 1 (5e supp) (Loi) pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2019. Les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus sur preuve commune.\n[3] Par ces nouvelles cotisations, la Ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par M. Gaudet et Mme Del Vecchio pour des montants de 36 856 $ et 17 023 $ respectivement.\n[4] Les frais engag\u00e9s pour le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9sidence au 22, boulevard de L\u2019Ange-Gardien \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption \u00e0 la nouvelle r\u00e9sidence au 845, avenue Dunlop \u00e0 Outremont, un arrondissement de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, font l\u2019objet de ce litige. Les appelants contestent la d\u00e9cision de la Ministre de leur refuser la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement.\nIII. Contexte\n[5] M. Gaudet a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme avocat chez Loranger Marcoux \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en 1998. En 1998, il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et plus tard \u00e0 Repentigny o\u00f9 il a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 avec son ex-conjointe et leurs trois enfants, n\u00e9s en 1999, 2000 et 2001, jusqu\u2019en 2012. M. Gaudet a expliqu\u00e9 que sa conjointe travaillait comme notaire dans un bureau \u00e0 Repentigny et qu\u2019ensemble, ils avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019installer \u00e0 Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se afin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e8s de son cabinet ainsi que pr\u00e8s d\u2019une gare facilitant l\u2019acc\u00e8s au centre-ville de Montr\u00e9al pour lui. Apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode d\u2019environ dix-huit mois, M. Gaudet et son ex-conjointe ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019installer \u00e0 Repentigny plus pr\u00e8s du bureau de Mme o\u00f9 ils ont achet\u00e9 un terrain et fait construire une maison. M. Gaudet faisait le trajet quotidien pour se rendre chez Loranger Marcoux \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[6] Vers la fin 2012, M. Gaudet et son ex-conjointe se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s et vers 2013, il a achet\u00e9 une maison \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption, r\u00e9sidence qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9e jusqu\u2019en 2019. En r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption, il demeurait pr\u00e8s de Repentigny ce qui lui a permis de s\u2019occuper de ses obligations familiales et de limiter les r\u00e9percussions de la rupture de l\u2019unit\u00e9 familiale sur les enfants.\n[7] Mme Del Vecchio a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Loranger Marcoux \u00e0 titre d\u2019avocate salari\u00e9e vers la fin 2006, d\u00e9but 2007, et elle est devenue associ\u00e9e en 2015. Elle a habit\u00e9 sur la rue de Saint-Just et ensuite sur la rue Dickson \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al de 2006 \u00e0 2014. Mme Del Vecchio a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter M. Gaudet en 2013 et elle a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption pour y r\u00e9sider avec lui vers 2013-2014. Ils ont eu un enfant en d\u00e9cembre 2016. Mme Del Vecchio a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 distance, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, travailler comme associ\u00e9e chez Loranger Marcoux \u00e0 partir de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption en 2015 et 2016, mais elle a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elle se pr\u00e9sente physiquement au bureau \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le genre de travail qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 faire. Elle affirme que M. Gaudet et elle n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 afin de faciliter les choses pour lui et ses trois enfants.\n[8] En d\u00e9cembre 2019, et apr\u00e8s que le troisi\u00e8me des enfants de M. Gaudet ait termin\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire, les appelants ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de L\u2019Assomption \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour \u00e9pargner le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 faire la navette de leur r\u00e9sidence au bureau de Loranger Marcoux. Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, ce sont les frais relatifs \u00e0 ce d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement qui font l\u2019objet de ce litige.\nIV. Droit et analyse\nDispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables\n[9] L\u2019article 62 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit les conditions \u00e0 remplir pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, soit les frais engag\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 une \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un contribuable aura droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction de ses frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement lorsqu\u2019ils sont engag\u00e9s pour exploiter une entreprise ou occuper un emploi \u00e0 un nouveau lieu de travail et qu\u2019il se rapproche de son nouveau lieu de travail d\u2019au moins 40 kilom\u00e8tres. Le montant d\u00e9ductible ne peut d\u00e9passer le revenu tir\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi au nouveau lieu de travail ou de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise au nouveau lieu de travail.\n[10] \u00c0 la lecture de l\u2019article 62, on peut constater plus d\u2019une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux expressions \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb et \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb, expressions au c\u0153ur de ce litige.\n[11] La partie pertinente de l\u2019article 62 se lit comme suit :\n62 (1) Un contribuable peut d\u00e9duire dans le calcul de son revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition les sommes qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9es au titre des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement engag\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 une r\u00e9installation admissible dans la mesure o\u00f9, \u00e0 la fois :\na) elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es en son nom relativement \u00e0 sa charge ou \u00e0 son emploi ou dans le cadre ou en raison de sa charge ou de son emploi;\nb) elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9ductibles par l\u2019effet du pr\u00e9sent article dans le calcul de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente;\nc) leur total ne d\u00e9passe pas le montant applicable suivant :\n(i) dans le cas vis\u00e9 au sous-alin\u00e9a a)(i) de la d\u00e9finition de r\u00e9installation admissible au paragraphe 248(1), le total des sommes repr\u00e9sentant chacune une somme incluse dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e tir\u00e9 de son emploi au nouveau lieu de travail ou de l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019entreprise au nouveau lieu de travail ou une somme incluse dans le calcul de son revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e par l\u2019effet du sous-alin\u00e9a 56(1)r)(v) relativement \u00e0 son emploi au nouveau lieu de travail,\n[\u2026]\nd) les remboursements et allocations qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us relativement \u00e0 ces frais sont inclus dans le calcul de son revenu.\n[Je souligne]\n[12] La d\u00e9finition de \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb au paragraphe 248(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit, en partie, ce qui suit :\nR\u00e9installation admissible R\u00e9installation d\u2019un contribuable relativement \u00e0 laquelle les faits ci-apr\u00e8s s\u2019av\u00e8rent :\na) elle est effectu\u00e9e afin de permettre au contribuable :\n(i) soit d\u2019exploiter une entreprise ou d\u2019occuper un emploi \u00e0 un endroit au Canada (appel\u00e9 \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 62 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition), sauf si le contribuable est absent du Canada, mais y r\u00e9side,\n[\u2026]\nb) avant la r\u00e9installation, le contribuable habitait ordinairement dans une r\u00e9sidence (appel\u00e9e \u00ab ancienne r\u00e9sidence \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 62 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition) et apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9installation, il habitait ordinairement dans une r\u00e9sidence (appel\u00e9e \u00ab nouvelle r\u00e9sidence \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 62 et dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition);\nc) sauf si le contribuable est absent du Canada, mais y r\u00e9side, l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9sidence et la nouvelle r\u00e9sidence sont toutes deux situ\u00e9es au Canada;\nd) la distance entre l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9sidence et le nouveau lieu de travail est sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019au moins 40 kilom\u00e8tres \u00e0 la distance entre la nouvelle r\u00e9sidence et le nouveau lieu de travail.\n[Je souligne]\n[13] Je note que la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb contient elle aussi des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb.\n[14] Je m\u2019empresse de pr\u00e9ciser que bon nombre des conditions pr\u00e9vues dans les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables ne font pas l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bat dans cette affaire. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que les appelants avaient une ancienne r\u00e9sidence (\u00e0 L\u2019Assomption) et une nouvelle r\u00e9sidence (\u00e0 Montr\u00e9al) ni que le crit\u00e8re de 40 kilom\u00e8tres est rempli. Quant au crit\u00e8re limitant les frais d\u00e9ductibles au revenu gagn\u00e9, il convient de mentionner que les appelants sont assujettis au plafond pr\u00e9vu au sous-alin\u00e9a 62(1)c)(i) de la Loi. Il importe de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9battu la question, les appelants ont convenu que si la Cour concluait qu\u2019il y avait une r\u00e9installation admissible en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le montant des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement d\u00e9ductible serait limit\u00e9 au montant du revenu d\u2019entreprise gagn\u00e9 par M. Gaudet et Mme Del Vecchio, soit 15 186 $ et 10 000 $ respectivement, l\u2019exc\u00e9dent pouvant \u00eatre report\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. Les appelants reconnaissent que les frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ne sont pas d\u00e9ductibles contre leur revenu de dividendes.\nPosition des appelants\n[15] Les appelants soutiennent qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 de L\u2019Assomption \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour des raisons professionnelles et qu\u2019ils remplissent les conditions l\u00e9gislatives. Ils affirment que la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas de d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur duquel le contribuable doit d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction. Qui plus est, ils soutiennent que le \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement besoin d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab nouveau \u00bb.\n[16] Selon les appelants, si la Cour devait conclure qu\u2019il faut avoir un \u00ab nouveau \u00bb lieu de travail, ils affirment en avoir eu un. La position mise de l\u2019avant par leur repr\u00e9sentant peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit : M. Gaudet avait un nouveau lieu de travail chez Loranger Marcoux en 1998; il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se pour s\u2019installer avec sa conjointe de l\u2019\u00e9poque et il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Repentigny avec elle vers 1999; vers 2013, apr\u00e8s sa s\u00e9paration, il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption; et finalement, il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al afin de se rapprocher du cabinet Loranger Marcoux en 2019, deux d\u00e9cennies plus tard. Des raisons personnelles l\u2019ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager plus vite, et puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de crit\u00e8re de d\u00e9lai dans la Loi, il a droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Quant \u00e0 Mme Del Vecchio, son repr\u00e9sentant affirme que les m\u00eames principes s\u2019appliquent; il pr\u00e9cise que le d\u00e9lai fut moins long que celui dans le cas de M. Gaudet, mais que les m\u00eames raisons personnelles l\u2019ont emp\u00each\u00e9e de red\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al plus vite.\nPosition de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[17] D\u2019embl\u00e9e, je tiens \u00e0 mentionner que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait des repr\u00e9sentations concernant le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement du cabinet Loranger Marcoux en fin 2014, d\u00e9but 2015. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un d\u00e9placement de 850 m\u00e8tres et je suis d\u2019accord qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un changement n\u00e9gligeable qui n\u2019affecte pas les principes applicables aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je note que le repr\u00e9sentant des appelants a affirm\u00e9 que ce d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement du cabinet n\u2019affectait pas ses observations et il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019en tenait pas compte (voir Transcription de l\u2019audience \u00e0 la p 113).\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, il est essentiel qu\u2019il y ait un \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb et que celui-ci doit \u00eatre g\u00e9ographiquement diff\u00e9rent. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e9montre que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a jamais retir\u00e9 l\u2019exigence d\u2019un nouveau lieu de travail de la Loi. Dans les circonstances, les appelants n\u2019ont pas de \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb li\u00e9 \u00e0 la cause de leur d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et n\u2019ont donc pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\n[19] De fa\u00e7on subsidiaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que si la Cour devait conclure que le nouveau lieu de travail n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre g\u00e9ographiquement diff\u00e9rent, il faut tout de m\u00eame qu\u2019il y ait eu des changements dans les conditions de travail du contribuable, changement ayant caus\u00e9 le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement en 2019, Mme Del Vecchio \u00e9tait associ\u00e9e depuis 2015 et M. Gaudet \u00e9tait associ\u00e9 depuis encore plus longtemps.\nAnalyse\n[20] J\u2019aimerais d\u2019abord examiner bri\u00e8vement l\u2019\u00e9volution historique de la disposition autorisant la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. De prime abord, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement vise \u00e0 faciliter la mobilit\u00e9 des Canadiens. Lors de son expos\u00e9 budg\u00e9taire en 1971 (Chambre des communes, Expos\u00e9 budg\u00e9taire, 28-3, (18 juin 1971) \u00e0 la p 6 (Hon Edgar John Benson)), le ministre des Finances, l\u2019honorable E.J. Benson, s\u2019exprimait comme suit :\nDe larges d\u00e9ductions seront accord\u00e9es pour les frais occasionn\u00e9s par un changement d\u2019emploi. On tiendra compte des frais de d\u00e9placement de la famille et des objets personnels, des repas et du logement en cours de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, ainsi que des frais de r\u00e9siliation des baux ou de vente des maisons. L\u2019\u00e9volution de notre population active et de notre \u00e9conomie exigent (sic) des Canadiens une plus grande mobilit\u00e9 s\u2019ils veulent pouvoir accepter les offres d\u2019emploi lorsqu\u2019elles se pr\u00e9sentent, et c\u2019est l\u2019objectif de cette mesure.\n[Je souligne]\n[21] Plus r\u00e9cemment, dans son Rapport sur les d\u00e9penses fiscales f\u00e9d\u00e9rales publi\u00e9 en 2019 (Finances Canada, Rapport sur les d\u00e9penses fiscales f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : Concepts, estimations et \u00e9valuations 2019, 11 avril 2019 aux pp 329-330), le minist\u00e8re des Finances s\u2019exprimait comme suit :\nLa d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement (DFD) offre un all\u00e8gement fiscal aux contribuables dont les frais de r\u00e9installation admissibles ne sont pas autrement rembours\u00e9s. La d\u00e9duction a pour but de tenir compte des co\u00fbts n\u00e9cessaires pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus et d\u2019encourager la mobilit\u00e9 et la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre au Canada.\n[\u2026]\nComme il est expliqu\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent rapport, la d\u00e9duction pour les frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement a un double objectif : \u00ab Cette mesure reconna\u00eet les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager plus pr\u00e8s d\u2019un nouveau lieu de travail, ce qui facilite la mobilit\u00e9 des travailleurs en permettant une plus grande souplesse aux contribuables dans le but de profiter de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et d\u2019affaires partout au Canada. [\u2026] En reconnaissant et en compensant partiellement ces d\u00e9penses, la d\u00e9pense fiscale favorise la neutralit\u00e9 entre la d\u00e9cision de gagner un revenu dans l\u2019emplacement actuel ou dans un nouvel emplacement.\n[Je souligne]\n[22] Entre ces \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de 1971 et 2019, l\u2019article 62 fut modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises. Par exemple, dans le plan budg\u00e9taire de 1998, le ministre des Finances a ajout\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments aux frais d\u00e9ductibles tout en rappelant que le r\u00e9gime fiscal applicable aux frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement visait \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la mobilit\u00e9 de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre au Canada (Chambre des communes, Le plan budg\u00e9taire de 1998, 36-1, (24 f\u00e9vrier 1998) aux pp 223-225 (Hon Paul Martin)). Aussi, dans les documents budg\u00e9taires de 1984 (Chambre des communes, Documents budg\u00e9taires, 31-2, (15 f\u00e9vrier 1984) \u00e0 la p 22 (Hon Marc Lalonde)), le ministre des Finances \u00e9crit ce qui suit concernant les frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement :\nLa Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu autorise actuellement une d\u00e9duction au titre des frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement lorsqu\u2019une personne qui cesse d\u2019\u00eatre employ\u00e9e doit d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de localit\u00e9 au Canada pour accepter un autre emploi. Le budget propose que cette d\u00e9duction soit accessible aux personnes qui \u00e9taient sans emploi et d\u00e9m\u00e9nagent apr\u00e8s 1983 pour prendre un emploi ou lancer une entreprise.\n[23] Dans le premier cas explicit\u00e9 au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le l\u00e9gislateur a modifi\u00e9 la Loi afin d\u2019\u00e9largir la cat\u00e9gorie des frais pouvant faire l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9duction et dans le second, il l\u2019a modifi\u00e9e afin de retirer l\u2019exigence selon laquelle le contribuable devait cesser d\u2019\u00eatre employ\u00e9 et accepter un nouvel emploi pour \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction rendant ainsi la d\u00e9duction accessible aux personnes sans emploi avant le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Dans les deux cas, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la Loi pour retirer l\u2019exigence selon laquelle le contribuable doit d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour un nouvel emploi ou une nouvelle activit\u00e9 d\u2019entreprise. D\u2019autres modifications l\u00e9gislatives faites en 2009 et en 2012 touchent \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments concernant la r\u00e9sidence au Canada et le revenu pouvant \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration aux fins de la d\u00e9duction, lesquels ne sont pas pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[24] \u00c0 mon avis, il est clair que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la d\u00e9duction afin d\u2019encourager la mobilit\u00e9 des Canadiens et les conditions \u00e0 remplir pour y avoir droit refl\u00e8tent cet objectif de la politique canadienne. Aussi, malgr\u00e9 les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi au fil du temps, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019un nouveau lieu de travail. Aujourd\u2019hui, le texte de l\u2019article 62 et celui de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab r\u00e9installation admissible \u00bb au paragraphe 248(1) contiennent de multiples r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb. Je ne peux accepter que le l\u00e9gislateur ait inclus cette expression sans vouloir lui attribuer un sens.\n[25] Les parties ont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions de cette Cour au soutien de leur position respective. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les trames factuelles vari\u00e9es pouvant se pr\u00e9senter dans les appels de la d\u00e9cision refusant la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et le contexte de la proc\u00e9dure informelle dans lequel elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues, il n\u2019est pas surprenant que chaque partie puisse trouver des d\u00e9cisions appuyant leur position. Je ne passerai pas en revue toutes les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es, mais je commenterai celles qui sont les plus pertinentes aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[26] Le repr\u00e9sentant des appelants a cit\u00e9 les affaires Wunderlich c R, 2011 CCI 539 (Wunderlich) et Dierckens c R, 2011 CCI 169 (Dierckens) \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position selon laquelle le lieu de travail n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre nouveau. Les faits de l\u2019affaire Wunderlich sont fort diff\u00e9rents de ceux en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M. Wunderlich a commenc\u00e9 un nouvel emploi en 2004 et a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 pour se rapprocher de son travail en 2008, apr\u00e8s avoir accept\u00e9 une promotion \u00e0 laquelle se rattachaient de nouvelles responsabilit\u00e9s; il n\u2019y eut pas de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement entre les deux, soit pour s\u2019\u00e9loigner de son lieu de travail et ensuite s\u2019y rapprocher comme ce fut le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En ce qui concerne l\u2019affaire Dierckens, il appert que la contribuable a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 en 2008 alors qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour son employeur pendant une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es; il ne semble pas y avoir eu de multiples d\u00e9m\u00e9nagements dans cette affaire non plus.\n[27] Dans les affaires Wunderlich et Dierckens, la Cour a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai dans le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ne pouvait servir d\u2019emp\u00eachement \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction. Depuis fort longtemps, la jurisprudence a reconnu que le libell\u00e9 des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes autorisant la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ne pr\u00e9voit aucun d\u00e9lai dans lequel doive se faire le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but d\u2019un emploi ou d\u2019une activit\u00e9 d\u2019entreprise au nouveau lieu de travail. Je suis d\u2019accord. Cela dit, l\u2019effet d\u2019une telle interpr\u00e9tation est tout simplement que pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction, il se peut que le contribuable prenne un certain temps avant de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour se rapprocher de son travail, mais non pas qu\u2019il peut d\u00e9m\u00e9nager pour s\u2019\u00e9loigner de son lieu de travail pour ensuite s\u2019en rapprocher plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus tard.\n[28] En revanche, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions dans lesquelles la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il fallait manifestement un nouveau lieu de travail pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, par exemple, les affaires Moreland c R, 2010 CCI 483, Langelier c R, 2013 CCI 322 et Zhao c R, 2015 CCI 124.\n[29] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes ainsi que l\u2019objectif de l\u2019article 62 et les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui sont rest\u00e9s stables au fil des ans, je ne peux pas accepter une interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir un nouveau lieu de travail pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Je partage l\u2019opinion des juges qui ont conclu que pour se pr\u00e9valoir de la d\u00e9duction, un contribuable doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a un \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb. \u00c0 mon avis, les termes de la loi l\u2019exigent clairement. Je suis aussi d\u2019avis qu\u2019il faut interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019expression avec une certaine souplesse, mais pas d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui en fait une d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de sens (voir \u00e0 cet effet les affaires Moreland, supra au para 13, Zhao, supra au para 15).\n[30] De fa\u00e7on subsidiaire, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que s\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir un nouveau lieu de travail g\u00e9ographiquement diff\u00e9rent, il faut \u00e0 tout le moins que le changement de r\u00e9sidence ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu n\u00e9cessaire par une modification importante de la situation de travail (voir G\u00e9linas c R, 2009 CCI 111). Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il est question de savoir pourquoi le contribuable a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que les responsabilit\u00e9s des appelants au travail n\u2019ont pas chang\u00e9 et en outre, que l\u2019augmentation dans leur revenu peut s\u2019expliquer par plusieurs facteurs qui sont pris en compte dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des avocats qui sont des associ\u00e9s. Je note que le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que les appelants avaient gagn\u00e9 plus de revenus en 2020 et 2021 qu\u2019ils n\u2019en avaient gagn\u00e9 en 2019. Non seulement s\u2019agit-il d\u2019ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures aux circonstances du litige, mais en outre, la hausse du revenu gagn\u00e9 au nouveau lieu de travail n\u2019est pas une condition l\u00e9gislative d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction.\n[31] \u00c0 mon avis, les appelants ne remplissent pas la condition selon laquelle il faut un nouveau lieu de travail pour avoir droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. M. Gaudet et Mme Del Vecchio r\u00e9sidaient \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al ou pr\u00e8s de Montr\u00e9al lorsqu\u2019ils ont obtenu leur emploi chez Loranger Marcoux, en 1998 et 2006 ou 2007 respectivement. Comme d\u00e9crit plus haut, ils se sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments, mais dans les deux cas pour des raisons personnelles. M. Gaudet a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, ensuite \u00e0 Repentigny et \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption avant de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en 2019. Mme Del Vecchio habitait Montr\u00e9al lorsqu\u2019elle a obtenu son emploi chez Loranger Marcoux et elle y est demeur\u00e9e jusqu\u2019en 2013-2014 quand elle s\u2019est \u00e9loign\u00e9e du lieu de travail pour d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 L\u2019Assomption, avant de red\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en 2019. Je ne crois pas que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de permettre \u00e0 des contribuables de d\u00e9duire leurs frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement pour se rapprocher d\u2019un ancien lieu de travail duquel ils se sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s alors qu\u2019ils r\u00e9sidaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e8s de leur lieu de travail. En ce qui concerne les exigences du travail d\u2019un associ\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 celui du salari\u00e9, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser d\u2019abord que les appelants \u00e9taient des associ\u00e9s depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et surtout, rien dans la preuve ne m\u2019a persuad\u00e9e que leurs conditions de travail aient chang\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui milite en faveur d\u2019une conclusion qu\u2019il y a un \u00ab nouveau lieu de travail \u00bb en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce selon une interpr\u00e9tation moins restrictive de cette expression (voir \u00e0 cet effet Langelier, supra aux paras 6 et 22 et Moreland, supra au para 13).\nConclusion\n[32] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-haut, les appels sont rejet\u00e9s. Les appelants n\u2019ont pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement engag\u00e9s en 2019.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 13e jour d\u2019avril 2023.\n\u00ab Gabrielle St-Hilaire \u00bb\nJuge St-Hilaire\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 46\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-2438(IT)I\n2021-2439(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nANN SOPHIE DEL VECCHIO ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI ET ST\u00c9PHANE GAUDET ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nle 6 mars 2023\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Gabrielle St-Hilaire\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 13 avril 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nRepr\u00e9sentant de l'appelante :\nRepr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant :\nFrancis Del Vecchio\nFrancis Del Vecchio\nAvocate de l'intim\u00e9 :\nMe Alice Zhao Jiang\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

Aper\u00e7u\n[1] La question en litige dans les pr\u00e9sents appels est de d\u00e9terminer si les cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des appelants \u2013 Len Little et Lucy Little, qui sont mari et femme \u2013 en application du paragraphe 323(1) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise (Canada)[1], relativement \u00e0 la taxe sur les produits et services\/taxe de vente harmonis\u00e9e (TPS\/TVH) exigible qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e par Lucy\u2019s Seafood Kitchen (Waterloo) Inc. (\u00ab Waterloo \u00bb), sont appropri\u00e9es dans les circonstances d\u00e9crites ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[2] Les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus sur preuve commune.\nII. Faits\n[3] Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint partiel des faits. Les appelants acceptent la plupart des hypoth\u00e8ses de fait sur lesquelles le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) s\u2019est fond\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des hypoth\u00e8ses de fait qui concernent l\u2019enregistrement du certificat de 26 570,71 $, lequel correspondait \u00e0 la somme pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e que Waterloo devait au titre de la TPS\/TVH, le 22 juin 2015.\n[4] Les appelants nient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il y a eu ex\u00e9cution de la somme indiqu\u00e9e dans le certificat, ce qui est une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 satisfaire pour qu\u2019un administrateur soit tenu responsable aux termes du paragraphe 323(1), partie IX, de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise (\u00ab LTA \u00bb).\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fait appel \u00e0 aucun t\u00e9moin. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tous les documents pertinents par affidavit, qui est souvent la mani\u00e8re dont la preuve est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019appels soumis \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure informelle, interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cotisations \u00e9tablies au titre de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un administrateur en application du paragraphe 323(1).\n[6] M. et Mme Little ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moins dans leurs appels.\n[7] M. Little, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident et administrateur de Waterloo, a reconnu que lui et son \u00e9pouse \u00e9taient les seules personnes autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 signer sur le compte bancaire de Waterloo. M. Little a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019il avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de veiller \u00e0 ce que Waterloo respecte ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9claration et de perception aux termes de la LTA.\n[8] Ouvert en 2004, le restaurant Waterloo a vu sa situation rapidement se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer apr\u00e8s la crise financi\u00e8re de 2008. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Little a affirm\u00e9 que les d\u00e9clarations fiscales de Waterloo ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites en retard en raison de probl\u00e8mes de liquidit\u00e9s. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude de joindre plusieurs ch\u00e8ques avec chaque d\u00e9claration, certains de ces ch\u00e8ques \u00e9tant postdat\u00e9s[2]. M. Little a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il payait certaines sommes au moyen de ch\u00e8ques postdat\u00e9s \u00e9tablis en fonction de ses propres pr\u00e9visions de ventes pour les mois \u00e0 venir. Il a dit avoir adopt\u00e9 cette m\u00e9thode parce que la personne morale n\u2019avait pas suffisamment de fonds en caisse pour payer le montant total de la TVH indiqu\u00e9 sur ses d\u00e9clarations.\n[9] Waterloo a finalement cess\u00e9 toute activit\u00e9 en mars 2009[3]. M. Little a reconnu avoir rendu les cl\u00e9s au propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 cette date et ne pas y \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 depuis. J\u2019en d\u00e9duis du t\u00e9moignage de M. Little que Waterloo ne disposait d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u2019actif qui aurait pu \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9 lorsque le certificat a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. M. Little a \u00e9galement admis n\u2019avoir conserv\u00e9 aucun document financier, relev\u00e9 bancaire ou dossier fiscal de Waterloo.\nIII. Les th\u00e8ses des parties\n[10] Les appelants soutiennent que Waterloo a pay\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la taxe nette exigible au titre de la LTA avant la fermeture de son service de restauration. Les appelants all\u00e8guent \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve au dossier \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il y a eu ex\u00e9cution totale ou partielle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la somme indiqu\u00e9e dans le certificat, ce qui est une condition pr\u00e9alable pour \u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un administrateur aux termes du paragraphe 323(1) de la LTA.\n[11] Bien entendu, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9fend la th\u00e8se contraire.\nA. La somme indiqu\u00e9e dans le certificat est-elle exacte?\n[12] Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019un administrateur a le droit de contester une dette sous-jacente de la personne morale, lorsqu\u2019une cotisation en d\u00e9coulant est \u00e9tablie en application du paragraphe 323(1) de la LTA. C\u2019est ce que les appelants ont choisi de faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[13] Lorsqu\u2019un administrateur conteste une cotisation sous-jacente de la personne morale, le fardeau de prouver que la cotisation est fond\u00e9e sur une dette fiscale erron\u00e9e incombe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 cet administrateur. Dans certaines circonstances, toutefois, le contribuable peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un renversement du fardeau de la preuve. Dans la d\u00e9cision Mignardi[4], le juge Paris a conclu que le fardeau de prouver l\u2019existence de la dette fiscale n\u2019est renvers\u00e9 et n\u2019incombe au ministre que \u00ab lorsque le ministre a une connaissance exclusive ou particuli\u00e8re des faits relatifs \u00e0 la dette fiscale sous\u2011jacente[5] \u00bb.\n[14] M. Little a reconnu qu\u2019il avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de veiller \u00e0 ce que Waterloo respecte ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9claration et de perception de la taxe aux termes de la LTA. Les d\u00e9clarations fiscales de Waterloo ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par un conseiller en fiscalit\u00e9 externe de Waterloo, \u00e0 partir des renseignements fournis par M. Little. M. Little \u00e9tablissait ensuite les paiements en fonction de la capacit\u00e9 de payer de Waterloo \u00e0 un moment pr\u00e9cis. M. Little savait que Waterloo \u00e9tait souvent en retard dans le paiement de la taxe nette exigible aux termes de la LTA.\n[15] Comme M. Little n\u2019a pas conserv\u00e9 les registres ou dossiers de Waterloo, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit pour prouver que la somme indiqu\u00e9e sur le certificat \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\n[16] \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a produit des copies de toutes les cotisations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Waterloo durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Ces cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies \u00e0 partir des d\u00e9clarations produites.\n[17] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire montrent en outre que les acomptes provisionnels de la personne morale ont d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s aux arri\u00e9r\u00e9s de paiement.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve dans son ensemble, je conclus que la dette exigible de Waterloo au titre de la LTA \u00e9tait de 26 570,71 $ lorsque le certificat a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9, le 22 juin 2015.\nB. Impossibilit\u00e9 de recouvrer les sommes de Waterloo\n[19] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 323(2)a) de la LTA exige que l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb) d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il lui est impossible de recouvrer les sommes en litige directement de la personne morale. L\u2019administrateur n\u2019encourt de responsabilit\u00e9 que si la condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 323(2)a) de la LTA est satisfaite :\na) un certificat pr\u00e9cisant la somme pour laquelle la personne morale est responsable a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en application de l\u2019article 316 et il y a eu d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution totale ou partielle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette somme;\n[20] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Barrett[6], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (CAF) a conclu que l\u2019ARC, en sa qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9ancier, n\u2019est pas tenue de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a fait des efforts raisonnables pour recouvrer la cr\u00e9ance et qu\u2019il lui suffit de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a agi de bonne foi, sans arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e ni motif inacceptable.\n[21] L\u2019article 316 de la LTA, auquel renvoie l\u2019alin\u00e9a 323(2)a), d\u00e9crit comment une dette exigible aux termes de la LTA peut, par certificat du ministre, \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e payable et pr\u00e9cise que le certificat doit ensuite \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Un certificat enregistr\u00e9 a le m\u00eame effet que s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un jugement rendu par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale contre le d\u00e9biteur et il peut \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre.\nC. D\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du certificat\n[22] Les parties pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du certificat. Les appelants affirment qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve au dossier n\u2019indique que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[23] Le paragraphe 335(5) \u00e9nonce un processus simplifi\u00e9 qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de pr\u00e9senter une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de documents au moyen d\u2019affidavits. La disposition est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e comme suit :\nPreuve de documents\n(5) L\u2019affidavit d\u2019un fonctionnaire de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada \u2013 souscrit en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un commissaire ou d\u2019une autre personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 le recevoir \u2013 indiquant qu\u2019il a la charge des registres pertinents et qu\u2019un document qui y est annex\u00e9 est un document, la copie conforme d\u2019un document ou l\u2019imprim\u00e9 d\u2019un document \u00e9lectronique, fait par ou pour le ministre ou une autre personne exer\u00e7ant les pouvoirs de celui-ci, ou par ou pour une personne, fait preuve de la nature et du contenu du document.\n[24] Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent que le bref de saisie et le relev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve par affidavit sont inadmissibles aux termes du paragraphe 335(5), car ces documents, dont des copies figurent dans les dossiers de l\u2019ARC, ne sont pas des documents faits par des personnes exer\u00e7ant les pouvoirs du ministre. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que tout document produit par l\u2019ARC est admissible aux termes de cette disposition. Le relev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements et le bref de saisie ne sont pas des documents qui proviennent de l\u2019ARC.\n[25] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que font les appelants du paragraphe 335(5). Cette disposition s\u2019applique \u00e0 un document qui est \u00ab fait par ou pour le ministre ou une autre personne exer\u00e7ant les pouvoirs de celui-ci, ou par ou pour une personne \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Le dernier renvoi englobe les personnes qui produisent des documents qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ARC aux termes de la LTA. Je suis d\u2019avis que le paragraphe 335(5) comprend la preuve de tout document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 dans les dossiers de l\u2019ARC, y compris les documents re\u00e7us par un inscrit.\n[26] Selon la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au paragraphe 123(1), le terme \u00ab document \u00bb, qui est utilis\u00e9 au paragraphe 335(5), comprend les registres. Un \u00ab registre \u00bb, selon la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au paragraphe 123(1), comprend les renseignements, qu\u2019ils soient par \u00e9crit ou sous toute autre forme. Le relev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9l\u00e8vements, le certificat et le bref de saisie sont tous des copies \u00e9lectroniques de documents figurant dans les registres de l\u2019ARC.\n[27] Si j\u2019ai tort et que ces documents sont irrecevables aux termes du paragraphe 335(5), je conclus n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du bref de saisie. M. Little a reconnu durant son t\u00e9moignage que deux agents du bureau du sh\u00e9rif se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 son domicile pour lui poser des questions au sujet de Waterloo. Il a \u00e9galement reconnu que Waterloo avait cess\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s il y a longtemps et avait quitt\u00e9 les locaux lou\u00e9s du propri\u00e9taire.\n[28] La pi\u00e8ce F de l\u2019affidavit est une copie d\u2019une lettre adress\u00e9e au bureau du sh\u00e9rif qui a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le bref de saisie. La lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. Stevenson, un agent de recouvrement de l\u2019ARC. Cette lettre pr\u00e9cisait que la personne morale avait cess\u00e9 toutes activit\u00e9s commerciales et chargeait le sh\u00e9rif de tenter d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le bref au domicile de M. Little.\n[29] M. Little a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 intimid\u00e9 lorsque les deux agents du bureau du sh\u00e9rif se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 son domicile et il a dit ne pas se souvenir de tout ce dont ils avaient discut\u00e9. Je conclus que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire montre qu\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la somme indiqu\u00e9e sur le certificat.\n[30] Il est justifi\u00e9 de formuler une derni\u00e8re observation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les pr\u00e9sents appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle. Le paragraphe 18.15(3) de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t[7] dispose que \u00ab la Cour n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles de preuve lors de l\u2019audition de tels appels; ceux-ci sont entendus d\u2019une mani\u00e8re informelle et le plus rapidement possible, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les circonstances et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 le permettent \u00bb.\n[31] Il ne fait aucun doute dans mon esprit que les appelants savent que le certificat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9. Les appelants n\u2019ont subi aucun pr\u00e9judice du fait de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver, au moyen d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire, que le bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9. On ne gagnerait rien \u00e0 convoquer les agents qui ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le bref de saisie au domicile des appelants, afin qu\u2019ils t\u00e9moignent que le bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 333(2)a).\n[32] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9tabli que le bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la dette de Waterloo au titre de la TVH a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 avant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des cotisations en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, la condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 323(2)a) a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite.\nIV. Conclusion\n[33] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, je conclus que les cotisations \u00e9tablies en application du paragraphe 323(1) de la LTA sont fond\u00e9es. Pour ces motifs, les appels des appelants sont rejet\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 13e jour d\u2019avril 2023.\n\u00ab Robert J.

Les faits\n[5] L\u2019appelant en appelle des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb), dont les avis sont dat\u00e9s du 7 ao\u00fbt 2015, qui ont ajout\u00e9 au revenu de l\u2019appelant selon la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu [1] (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) des revenus de location pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2006 \u00e0 2009 et qui ont refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses de location pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2006 \u00e0 2008.\n[6] Selon l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, la v\u00e9rification fiscale de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 en novembre 2009, lorsqu\u2019un v\u00e9rificateur de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) lui a fait parvenir une lettre demandant les documents pertinents \u00e0 cette v\u00e9rification. En mai 2009 (l\u2019appelant voulait probablement plut\u00f4t indiquer mai 2010), l\u2019appelant et son mandataire auraient remis quatre bo\u00eetes de documents ou pi\u00e8ces justificatives au v\u00e9rificateur.\n[7] En juillet 2010, le dossier de l\u2019appelant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la division des enqu\u00eates criminelles de l\u2019ARC. Lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, les enqu\u00eateurs auraient fait parvenir des demandes p\u00e9remptoires \u00e0 la Caisse Desjardins, la Banque Laurentienne, la Banque Nationale du Canada, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec et Equifax \u00c9galement, l\u2019appelant aurait remis aux enqu\u00eateurs de l\u2019ARC quatre bo\u00eetes de documents contenant des renseignements concernant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009.\n[8] Enfin, en f\u00e9vrier 2014, le dossier de la division des enqu\u00eates criminelles pour l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la division de la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ARC. Aucune accusation p\u00e9nale ou criminelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre l\u2019appelant.\nIV. Les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux applicables\n[9] Le pouvoir de radier en tout ou en partie un acte de proc\u00e9dure est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 des R\u00e8gles, qui dispose :\n53 (1) La Cour peut, de son propre chef ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, radier un acte de proc\u00e9dure ou tout autre document ou en supprimer des passages, en tout ou en partie, avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier parce que l\u2019acte ou le document :\na) peut compromettre ou retarder l\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable de l\u2019appel;\nb) est scandaleux, frivole ou vexatoire;\nc) constitue un recours abusif \u00e0 la Cour;\nd) ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucun moyen raisonnable d\u2019appel ou de contestation de l\u2019appel.\n(2) Aucune preuve n\u2019est admissible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)d).\n(3) \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour peut casser un appel si :\na) elle n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence sur l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel;\nb) une condition pr\u00e9alable pour interjeter appel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite;\nc) l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas la capacit\u00e9 juridique d\u2019introduire ou de continuer l\u2019instance.\n53 (1) The Court may, on its own initiative or on application by a party, strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document\n(a) may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal;\n(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;\n(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court; or\n(d) discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal or opposing the appeal.\n(2) No evidence is admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(d).\n(3) On application by the respondent, the Court may quash an appeal if\n(a) the Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal;\n(b) a condition precedent to instituting an appeal has not been met; or\n(c) the appellant is without legal capacity to commence or continue the proceeding.\n[10] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Imperial Tobacco Canada, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 45, 2011 CSC 42, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tabli les principes en mati\u00e8re de radiation d\u2019une demande en justice. La requ\u00eate en radiation ne doit pas \u00eatre prise \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re et repr\u00e9sente \u00ab une importante mesure de gouverne judiciaire essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s \u00bb et \u00ab permet d\u2019\u00e9laguer les litiges en \u00e9cartant les demandes vaines et en assurant l\u2019instruction des demandes susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre accueillies \u00bb (par. 19). Ainsi, le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame est le suivant :\n[...] Le tribunal doit plut\u00f4t se demander si, dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s seraient av\u00e9r\u00e9s, il est raisonnablement possible que l\u2019action soit accueillie. L\u2019approche doit \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et permettre, dans la mesure du possible, l\u2019instruction de toute demande in\u00e9dite, mais soutenable. (par. 21)\n[11] \u00c0 mon avis, ces principes s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement dans les circonstances qui nous occupent, bien qu\u2019on ne cherche \u00e0 faire radier que certains passages de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n[12] Le crit\u00e8re pour accueillir une requ\u00eate en radiation est donc rigoureux. La Cour ne doit radier tout ou partie d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure que s\u2019il est \u00e9vident et manifeste, notamment, qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucun moyen raisonnable d\u2019appel et que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueilli (Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd. c. La Reine, 2004 CAF 403, au par. 3).\n[13] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si tout ou partie d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre radi\u00e9, les faits expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019acte sont tenus pour av\u00e9r\u00e9s. La Cour n\u2019entend aucun t\u00e9moignage. Comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 notre Cour dans 881751 Ontario Limited c. La Reine, Roy c. La Reine, 2021 CCI 9 (au par. 15) :\n[...] L\u2019approche de la Cour doit \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et permettre, dans la mesure du possible, l\u2019instruction de toute demande in\u00e9dite, mais d\u00e9fendable. Ce n\u2019est pas la mission du juge des requ\u00eates de d\u00e9cider si un argument m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9, ou d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion concernant une question litigieuse sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en radiation puisse \u00eatre accueillie, l\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou la non-pertinence doit \u00eatre \u00e9vidente et manifeste au premier coup d\u2019oeil.\n[14] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande la radiation de certains passages de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel sans autorisation de modifier l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Pour que la Cour refuse l\u2019autorisation de modifier, il faut que les passages ne puissent \u00eatre corrig\u00e9s par une modification (Collins c. La Reine, 2011 CAF 140, au par. 26, et Simon c.

En effet, l\u2019appelant ne pr\u00e9tend pas que le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats est erron\u00e9 ou que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne sont pas exigibles conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi, mais plut\u00f4t que les int\u00e9r\u00eats qui lui sont impos\u00e9s sont exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9duits. Toutefois, le pouvoir de r\u00e9duire ou d\u2019annuler les int\u00e9r\u00eats est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au ministre conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 220(3.1) de la Loi. Ce pouvoir est discr\u00e9tionnaire et est assujetti au contr\u00f4le exclusif de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non de notre Cour (Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales [3] , articles 18 et 18.1, et JP Morgan Management (Canada) Inc. c. Canada (Revenu national), 2013 CAF 250, [2014] 2 R.C.F. 557, au par. 90).\n[19] En effet, lors de l\u2019appel d\u2019une cotisation, la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 171 de la Loi, qui dispose :\n171 (1) La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t peut statuer sur un appel :\na) en le rejetant;\nb) en l\u2019admettant et en :\n(i) annulant la cotisation,\n(ii) modifiant la cotisation,\n(iii) d\u00e9f\u00e9rant la cotisation au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation.\n171 (1) The Tax Court of Canada may dispose of an appeal by\n(a) dismissing it; or\n(b) allowing it and\n(i) vacating the assessment,\n(ii) varying the assessment, or\n(iii) referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[20] Ainsi, notre Cour doit d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 et le bien-fond\u00e9 de la cotisation en fonction des dispositions applicables de la Loi et des faits donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019obligation du contribuable pr\u00e9vu par la Loi (Ereiser c. Canada, 2013 CAF 20, [2013] 2 R.C.F. F\u20119, au par. 31).\n[21] La jurisprudence est unanime pour dire que notre Cour ne peut ordonner au ministre d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu du paragraphe 220(3.1) de la Loi (Raby c. La Reine, 2006 CCI 406, au par. 51, Madore c.

subsection (1) may be\n(a) served personally;\n(b) sent by registered or certified mail; or\n(c) sent electronically to a bank or credit union that has provided written consent to receive notices under subsection (1) electronically.\nUnnamed persons\n(2) The Minister shall not impose on any person (in this section referred to as a \u201cthird party\u201d) a requirement under subsection 231.2(1) to provide information or any document relating to one or more unnamed persons unless the Minister first obtains the authorization of a judge under subsection 231.2(3).\nJudicial authorization\n(3) A judge of the Federal Court may, on application by the Minister and subject to any conditions that the judge considers appropriate, authorize the Minister to impose on a third party a requirement under subsection (1) relating to an unnamed person or more than one unnamed person (in this section referred to as the \u201cgroup\u201d) if the judge is satisfied by information on oath that\n(a) the person or group is ascertainable; and\n(b) the requirement is made to verify compliance by the person or persons in the group with any duty or obligation under this Act.\nTh\u00e8ses des parties :\n[29] Selon l\u2019appelant, la preuve obtenue par la division des enqu\u00eates criminelles ne satisfait pas aux exigences du paragraphe 231.1(2) et de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les cotisations contreviennent aux articles 7 et 8 de la Charte. De m\u00eame, selon l\u2019appelant, le ministre ne peut utiliser les renseignements obtenus par la division des enqu\u00eates pour \u00e9tablir sa responsabilit\u00e9 fiscale. Pour soutenir ces arguments, l\u2019appelant renvoie au principe \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Jarvis, 2002 CSC 73, [2002] 3 R.C.S. 757 (Jarvis), selon lequel un contribuable vis\u00e9 par une enqu\u00eate a droit \u00e0 la protection de l\u2019article 7 de la Charte.\n[30] Ainsi, selon l\u2019appelant, les enqu\u00eateurs ne l\u2019ont pas inform\u00e9 de ses droits pr\u00e9vus par la Charte, ce qui contrevient aux principes \u00e9tablis par l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis. De plus, selon l\u2019appelant, l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis a \u00e9tabli le principe selon lequel lorsqu\u2019une v\u00e9rification administrative et une enqu\u00eate criminelle sont men\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment, les enqu\u00eateurs ne peuvent utiliser que les renseignements obtenus conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs de v\u00e9rification avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle et ne peuvent utiliser les renseignements obtenus lors de la v\u00e9rification apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale. De plus, aucun mandat n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu d\u2019un tribunal pour obtenir les informations et les documents d\u2019Equifax, d\u2019Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec et des diverses banques, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 231.2(3)b) de la Loi. Selon l\u2019appelant, puisque l\u2019objet dominant de l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tablir sa responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale, les pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus aux articles 231.1 et 231.2 de la Loi ne pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par le fisc.\n[31] L\u2019appelant demande donc l\u2019exclusion de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus ill\u00e9galement selon lui par la division des enqu\u00eates et transmis ill\u00e9galement au service de la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ARC.\n[32] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelant reconna\u00eet qu\u2019aucune accusation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre lui. L\u2019appelant admet aussi que les renseignements obtenus au moyen des demandes p\u00e9remptoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au service de v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ARC. Selon l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, il est clair que ce n\u2019est pas la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale ou criminelle de l\u2019appelant qui est en litige devant notre Cour, mais bien la validit\u00e9 et le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des cotisations eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la Loi.\n[33] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019enqu\u00eate p\u00e9nale \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9e (comme l\u2019a admis l\u2019appelant), le seul objet qui demeure est l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019obligation fiscale de l\u2019appelant. Or, les articles 231.1 et 231.2 de la Loi conf\u00e8rent ind\u00e9niablement au ministre des pouvoirs qui peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019obligation fiscale de l\u2019appelant.\n[34] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, la Cour supr\u00eame a ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019exclusion de certains registres bancaires de toute proc\u00e9dure criminelle ult\u00e9rieure, puisqu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui porte atteinte aux droits garantis par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte, puisque l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait bien en cours au moment de la demande p\u00e9remptoire (Jarvis, au par. 105). L\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis ne justifie toutefois pas qu\u2019on exclue des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lors d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure civile (fiscale) ult\u00e9rieure.\n[35] En conclusion, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelant, les paragraphes 231.2(2) et (3) de la Loi ne s\u2019appliquent pas, puisque ces paragraphes visent des personnes non d\u00e9sign\u00e9es nomm\u00e9ment dans la demande de renseignements, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, le paragraphe 231.2(1) de la Loi peut s\u2019appliquer sans qu\u2019une autorisation pr\u00e9alable ne soit requise.\nDiscussion :\n[36] Tout d\u2019abord, il faut noter que l\u2019appelant ne soul\u00e8ve pas la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition de la Loi. L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend plut\u00f4t que ses droits fondamentaux n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s; il soul\u00e8ve les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte, ainsi que les articles 231.1 et 231.2 de la Loi.\n[37] Pour les motifs suivants, et selon les principes jurisprudentiels bien \u00e9tablis d\u00e9crits ci-dessous, la Cour ne peut retenir les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant. L\u2019appelant ne peut invoquer les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte pour exclure les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par le ministre dans l\u2019exercice de ses pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 231.1 de la Loi et par l\u2019envoi de demandes de renseignements en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelant, lors de la v\u00e9rification fiscale de l\u2019appelant, le ministre ne devait obtenir aucune autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable.\n[38] C\u2019est donc \u00e0 bon droit que l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande la radiation des passages de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel portant sur la Charte et les articles 231.1 et 231.2 de la Loi.\n[39] La v\u00e9rification de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 en novembre 2009; le dossier de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la division des enqu\u00eates de l\u2019ARC en juillet 2010. Lors de cette enqu\u00eate, le ministre a fait parvenir des demandes de renseignements \u00e0 diverses entreprises, notamment Equifax, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec et la Banque Nationale du Canada. Par la suite, en f\u00e9vrier 2014 le dossier de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la section de la v\u00e9rification afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir les cotisations qui font l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel \u00e0 notre Cour.\n[40] Ainsi, les renseignements obtenus par l\u2019envoi des demandes de renseignements ont servi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les cotisations de l\u2019appelant, et non pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une quelconque responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale ou criminelle au titre de la Loi. En effet, aucune accusation p\u00e9nale ou criminelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre l\u2019appelant, ce dont l\u2019appelant convient dans son avis d\u2019appel. Comme mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, le litige devant notre Cour porte sur la validit\u00e9 et le bien-fond\u00e9 des nouvelles cotisations dont les avis sont dat\u00e9s du 7 ao\u00fbt 2015; il ne vise pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une quelconque responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale ou criminelle de l\u2019appelant. De plus, m\u00eame si le ministre a envoy\u00e9 les demandes de renseignements alors que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait sous enqu\u00eate, la preuve ainsi obtenue peut-\u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir une cotisation fiscale.\n[41] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada devait d\u00e9terminer si la preuve obtenue par l\u2019exercice par le ministre de ses pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 231.1 de la Loi, ainsi que par l\u2019envoi de demandes de renseignements en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi, pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e lors d\u2019une poursuite relative \u00e0 une infraction aux termes de la Loi (article 239 de la Loi).\n[42] Selon la Cour supr\u00eame, ces pouvoirs ne pouvaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s pour obtenir des d\u00e9clarations verbales ou la production de documents \u00e9crits dans le but de faire progresser une enqu\u00eate criminelle (Jarvis, au par. 97). Ainsi, \u00ab d\u00e8s qu\u2019un examen ou une question a pour objet pr\u00e9dominant d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale du contribuable, il faut utiliser les techniques d\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. \u00c0 titre corollaire, toutes les garanties pr\u00e9vues par la Charte, pertinentes dans le contexte criminel, s\u2019appliquent obligatoirement \u00bb (Jarvis, au par. 98). Et dans un tel cas, le ministre ne peut plus utiliser ses pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 231.1 de la Loi ou envoyer des demandes de renseignements en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi pour obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve servant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 criminelle du contribuable.\n[43] Toutefois, la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate p\u00e9nale n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la possibilit\u00e9 que soit men\u00e9e simultan\u00e9ment une enqu\u00eate dont l\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant est d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019obligation fiscale du contribuable. Ainsi, selon la Cour supr\u00eame :\n[...] il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019on peut continuer d\u2019avoir recours aux pouvoirs de v\u00e9rification, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s le commencement d\u2019une enqu\u00eate, quoique les r\u00e9sultats de cette v\u00e9rification ne puissent pas servir pour les besoins de l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou de la poursuite. (Jarvis, au par. 103)\n[44] Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019en utilisant les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le paragraphe 231.1(1) de la Loi alors qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait en cours, le ministre n\u2019avait pas viol\u00e9 les droits du contribuable garantis par les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte (Romanuk c. La Reine, 2013 CAF 133 (Romanuk)). Ainsi, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis lors de l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 231.1(1) de la Loi pouvaient servir \u00e0 des fins administratives, comme l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cotisation (Romanuk, au par. 7). La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu ainsi :\n[8] L\u2019usage de tels renseignements ou documents pour les besoins de l\u2019administration de la Loi et l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations de l\u2019appelante ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 ses droits garantis par les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte, puisque l\u2019ARC a le droit de continuer \u00e0 utiliser ses pouvoirs de v\u00e9rification, pour autant que les renseignements ou documents ainsi recueillis ne soient utilis\u00e9s qu\u2019aux fins d\u2019administration de la Loi. S\u2019ils doivent servir \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate ou \u00e0 une poursuite au titre de l\u2019article 239 de la Loi, le tribunal saisi de la poursuite devra alors d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019exercice de ces pouvoirs avait pour objet pr\u00e9dominant de recueillir des renseignements ou des documents aux fins d\u2019une telle enqu\u00eate ou poursuite.\n[Je souligne]\n[45] Par la suite, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Piersanti c. La Reine, 2014 CAF 243, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que notre Cour avait \u00e0 bon droit rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le contribuable au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience afin d\u2019exclure tous les documents utilis\u00e9s par le ministre pour \u00e9tablir les avis de nouvelle cotisation au motif que ces documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus sans autorisation judiciaire au cours d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle et en violation des droits que lui garantissait la Charte. Apr\u00e8s avoir renvoy\u00e9 aux principes \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Romanuk, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu ainsi :\n[9] La juge n\u2019a commis aucune erreur de droit lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu que l\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits de l\u2019appelante garantis par les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte lorsqu\u2019elle a utilis\u00e9 les renseignements recueillis pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle pour \u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des obligations fiscales de l\u2019appelante pour les ann\u00e9es en question. La conclusion juridique de la juge est compatible avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis et avec le r\u00e9gime fiscal d\u2019autocotisation et d\u2019autod\u00e9claration. [...]\n[Je souligne]\n[46] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bauer c. La Reine, 2018 CAF 62, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que, lors d\u2019un appel \u00e0 notre Cour, la preuve obtenue par l\u2019envoi de demandes de renseignements en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi ne pouvait \u00eatre exclue selon l\u2019article 8 de la Charte, et ce, m\u00eame si une enqu\u00eate avait commenc\u00e9 avant l\u2019envoi des demandes de renseignements. Selon la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\n[14] Bien que le recours \u00e0 des demandes p\u00e9remptoires en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la LIR pour obtenir des renseignements ou des documents apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but d\u2019une enqu\u00eate puisse faire en sorte que ces renseignements ou ces documents ne soient pas admissibles dans une poursuite relative \u00e0 des infractions vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 239 de la LIR, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas que ces renseignements ou documents soient admissibles dans une instance devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie en vertu de la LIR. C\u2019est l\u2019utilisation des renseignements ou des documents qui est pertinente, et non la personne, \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, qui a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 la demande p\u00e9remptoire de renseignements ou de documents.\n[...]\n[17] \u00c0 mon avis, il est \u00e9vident et manifeste que le pouvoir de l\u2019ARC de d\u00e9livrer des demandes p\u00e9remptoires en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la LIR pour obtenir des renseignements ou des documents qui seront utilis\u00e9s pour les besoins administratifs li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un contribuable n\u2019est pas suspendu par le lancement d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. Par cons\u00e9quent, les renseignements ou les documents obtenus par suite de la d\u00e9livrance des demandes p\u00e9remptoires en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne peuvent \u00eatre exclus, sur le fondement de l\u2019article 8 de la Charte, de la proc\u00e9dure devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t concernant la validit\u00e9 des nouvelles cotisations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019obligation fiscale de M. Bauer pour 2007 et 2008.\n[Je souligne]\n[47] Enfin, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une cotisation fiscale est de nature civile et ne touche que des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9conomiques, et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00ab ne prive pas la personne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle elle est \u00e9tablie de sa vie, de sa libert\u00e9 ou de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Charte \u00bb (Gratl c. La Reine, 2012 CAF 88, au par. 8; voir \u00e9galement Johnson c. La Reine, 2022 CCI 31, aux par. 48 et 49).\n[48] Pour ces motifs, la Cour conclut que le ministre pouvait utiliser ses pouvoirs d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 231.1 de la Loi de m\u00eame que proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019envoi de demandes de renseignements en vertu de l\u2019article 231.2 de la Loi lors de la v\u00e9rification fiscale de l\u2019appelant m\u00eame si une enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours. En effet, l\u2019objectif \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019obligation fiscale de l\u2019appelant et non pas une quelconque responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale ou criminelle. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi obtenus par le ministre pourront \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s lors d\u2019une audience devant notre Cour sur la validit\u00e9 et le bien-fond\u00e9 des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies en vertu de la Loi, dont les avis sont dat\u00e9s du 7 avril 2015.\n[49] De plus, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelant, le ministre ne devait obtenir aucune autorisation judiciaire pr\u00e9alable en vertu de la Loi. En effet, les paragraphes 231.2(2) et (3) de la Loi ne visent que les demandes de renseignements portant sur des personnes non d\u00e9sign\u00e9es nomm\u00e9ment, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.

Plante: [9] L\u2019appel concerne les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2003 \u00e0 2008. En vertu des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, des montants totalisant 1 526 144$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante \u00e0 titre de paiements indirects en vertu du paragraphe 56(2) de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2004 \u00e0 2008, et des d\u00e9penses totalisant 13 128$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2003. Les montants ainsi ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante repr\u00e9sentent les d\u00e9penses de commercialisation dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 SPE. De plus, des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es pour toutes les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition.\n[10] Le ministre pr\u00e9tend que, suivant les instructions de M. Plante, SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les sommes mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus de son compte bancaire aux comptes bancaires de pr\u00e9tendues soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines de mise en march\u00e9 dans le but pour M.

Plante, ce dernier aurait d\u00fb inclure ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu du paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi.\n[11] De plus, le ministre pr\u00e9tend que M.

La Cour propose deux options aux parties : soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s devant un juge \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef, ou soit qu\u2019un juge nomm\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers (transcriptions et documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve lors de l\u2019audition des appels) et selon des modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par le nouveau juge. Si les parties d\u00e9cident qu\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s est requis, ce proc\u00e8s sera fix\u00e9 devant un nouveau juge. Si les parties consentent \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un juge rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, la Cour indique que ce juge communiquera avec les parties pour leur faire part de ce qu\u2019il aura besoin pour rendre jugement, que ce soit en terme d\u2019observations additionnelles ou de toute autre modalit\u00e9. Les parties doivent faire part de leurs choix s\u2019il y a entente entre eux au plus tard le 15 avril 2022, ou bien, en cas de m\u00e9sentente entre eux, les parties doivent soumettre des observations \u00e9crites au juge en chef au plus tard le 29 avril 2022;\n29 avril 2022 : les requ\u00e9rants indiquent au juge en chef que leur choix, pris de commun accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, est de proc\u00e9der selon les modalit\u00e9s suivantes :\n\u00c0 cet effet, nous proposons que l\u2019ensemble de la preuve testimoniale et documentaire administr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du premier proc\u00e8s le soit de pareille mani\u00e8re aux fins de la nouvelle audition (en tenant compte des objections formul\u00e9es par les parties). Ce deuxi\u00e8me proc\u00e8s serait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 un exercice de r\u00e9vision de la preuve par les parties, de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux plaidoiries qui seraient reprises dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Cet exercice serait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e r\u00e9duite et permettrait entre autres aux parties de renseigner la Cour sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u2019importance et r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui pourraient \u00eatre amen\u00e9es par le nouveau juge attitr\u00e9 au dossier.\n31 mai 2022 : une autre conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance est tenue par la Cour devant le juge Boyle, au nom du juge en chef : la Cour prend acte du choix des parties comme d\u00e9crit dans leur lettre du 29 avril 2022, soit qu\u2019une audience soit fix\u00e9e pour permettre aux parties de r\u00e9viser la preuve et de pr\u00e9senter leurs soumissions. Ainsi, l\u2019audience pourra \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec au cours des mois de juin 2023, ou par la suite, selon la dur\u00e9e voulue par les parties (3 jours). Les parties indiquent qu\u2019ils pourraient possiblement se lib\u00e9rer \u00e9galement au cours de l\u2019hiver 2023, pour une audition \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Les parties sont avis\u00e9es que la prochaine \u00e9tape sera probablement la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour rendre jugement dans ces dossiers;\n21 octobre 2022 : les requ\u00e9rants indiquent qu\u2019ils ne sont pas disponibles aux dates offertes par la Cour pour l\u2019audition de ces dossiers et demandent de fixer une conf\u00e9rence de gestion;\n10 novembre 2022 : ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par le juge en chef pour rendre jugement dans ces dossiers, je tiens une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience. Les requ\u00e9rants avisent alors la Cour qu\u2019ils veulent pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 la tenue de l\u2019audience pour faire valoir que les appels doivent \u00eatre admis et les nouvelles cotisations annul\u00e9es dans les deux dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, pour les motifs de violation aux principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Aucune date d\u2019audience n\u2019est alors fix\u00e9e, puisque les requ\u00e9rants rejettent leur propre proposition d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du 29 avril 2022;\n9 janvier 2023 : la Cour tient une nouvelle conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance devant le juge Boyle, au nom du juge en chef. La Cour rappelle aux parties les deux options offertes aux parties pour la suite des dossiers : soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, ou soit qu\u2019un juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es par ce juge. Les requ\u00e9rants r\u00e9it\u00e8rent la permission de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. La Cour donne permission aux requ\u00e9rants de d\u00e9poser la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire au plus tard le 24 janvier 2023. Aucune date d\u2019audition n\u2019est alors fix\u00e9e;\n24 janvier 2023 : je tiens une nouvelle conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience, au cours de laquelle je rappelle aux parties que les options offertes par la Cour \u00e9taient soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s devant un nouveau juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef, ou soit qu\u2019un nouveau juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es par ce juge, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Les requ\u00e9rants all\u00e8guent qu\u2019ils refusent de proc\u00e9der selon l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des options offertes par la Cour de m\u00eame que de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du 29 avril 2022, compte tenu des d\u00e9lais \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis cette date, et indiquent qu\u2019ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 d\u00e9poser la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mention en novembre dernier.\nV. TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES Les requ\u00e9rants :\n[15] Les requ\u00e9rants ne contestent pas le pouvoir du juge en chef de la Cour de r\u00e9assigner les dossiers \u00e0 un autre juge de la Cour. Toutefois, les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que le processus mis en place par la Cour n\u2019est pas \u00e9quitable pour les requ\u00e9rants, et r\u00e9sulte en un abus de proc\u00e9dure, telle que cette doctrine est connue et appliqu\u00e9e dans le cadre du droit administratif.\n[16] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, les deux options propos\u00e9es par la Cour suite au d\u00e9part de la juge pr\u00e9sidente, soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ou soit un jugement rendu sur la base des dossiers (selon des modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par un nouveau juge), r\u00e9sultent en un abus de proc\u00e9dure, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale pour les requ\u00e9rants dans le cadre de l\u2019une et l\u2019autre des options offertes aux parties. De plus, m\u00eame si la Cour conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, il y aurait abus de proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9sultant des d\u00e9lais judiciaires dans ces dossiers dont ils ne sont pas responsables.\n[17] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif, \u00e9tant une notion tr\u00e8s flexible, doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9e au d\u00e9cideur administratif et doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on large. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est applicable dans divers contextes et particuli\u00e8rement dans ces dossiers.\n[18] Les requ\u00e9rants conviennent que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est inusit\u00e9e et que les questions soulev\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par la Cour. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, la Cour a la comp\u00e9tence pour octroyer les conclusions recherch\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants, soit d\u2019admettre les appels dans ces dossiers et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour les motifs d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour. Selon les requ\u00e9rant, les cas de M. Plante et de SPE sont des cas hors normes n\u00e9cessitant une intervention hors norme de la Cour.\n[19] Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019option de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s serait en principe acceptable pour les requ\u00e9rants, mais ils ne peuvent y acquiescer. En effet, la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ternirait l\u2019image de la justice puisqu\u2019il ne pourrait y avoir de garantie au niveau de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale du nouveau proc\u00e8s, r\u00e9sultant en un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis 2017, la difficult\u00e9 de retrouver certains t\u00e9moins, la m\u00e9moire d\u00e9faillante des t\u00e9moins ainsi que les difficult\u00e9s pour M. Plante et SPE d\u2019obtenir des services juridiques vu l\u2019estim\u00e9 des honoraires professionnelles pour se faire ainsi repr\u00e9senter dans le cadre d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 38-39).\n[20] Alternativement, les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s porterait atteinte aux droits de M. Plante garantis par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychologique de M. Plante seraient compromises par la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 40).\n[21] La seconde option offerte par la Cour, soit qu\u2019un juge rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, n\u2019est \u00e9galement pas acceptable pour les requ\u00e9rants. En effet, de la r\u00e8gle voulant que les parties ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendues d\u00e9coule le principe que ce soit le juge ayant pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s qui rende jugement. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un autre juge rend jugement, cette r\u00e8gle n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e et cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale n\u2019est pas maintenue. Les requ\u00e9rants conviennent toutefois que la disponibilit\u00e9 des enregistrements sonores de l\u2019audience vient r\u00e9duire la port\u00e9e de cet argument, mais ne l\u2019\u00e9limine pas compl\u00e8tement. \u00c9galement, les dossiers sont tr\u00e8s volumineux. Plusieurs documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en preuve et certains documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits sur support informatique.\n[22] De plus, le juge qui doit rendre jugement sur dossier est li\u00e9 par toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par la juge pr\u00e9sidente au cours du proc\u00e8s. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, en l\u2019absence du consentement des parties, la Cour ne peut ordonner pareil mode de fonctionnement.\n[23] Pour ces raisons, les requ\u00e9rants ne peuvent acquiescer \u00e0 la demande de la Cour, et demandent d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 :\n[24] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour \u00e9tant un tribunal judiciaire, la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif ne peut s\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9cisions ou ordonnances de la Cour relatives \u00e0 sa propre proc\u00e9dure. \u00c9galement, la Cour n\u2019a vraisemblablement pas comp\u00e9tence pour admettre les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, telle que cette doctrine est connue en droit administratif. Pour ces raisons, la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[25] De plus, m\u00eame si la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif \u00e9tait applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste, bien que le d\u00e9lai de 26 mois ou de 8 mois depuis la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par la juge pr\u00e9sidente est consid\u00e9rable, ce d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pas excessif : le point de d\u00e9part du d\u00e9lai est soit le 20 janvier 2020 (ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve), ou soit le 27 juillet 2021 (inscription au plumitif de la Cour de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) et se termine au mois de mars 2022, au moment o\u00f9 la Cour a avis\u00e9 les parties du d\u00e9part de la juge pr\u00e9sidente. Ainsi, il ne serait pas justifi\u00e9 d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour ce motif. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice commande qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue par la Cour dans un proc\u00e8s qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision sur le fond qui constituerait un d\u00e9ni de justice, et non le contraire.\n[26] En vertu de l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, un juge de la Cour d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour continuer les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants peut d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en s\u2019assurant que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, qui pourrait \u00eatre soit de rendre jugement sur la base des dossiers ou encore, soit d\u2019ordonner la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame sans l\u2019accord des parties (D\u2019Amico v. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785 [D\u2019Amico], par. 44).\n[27] Finalement, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019argument des requ\u00e9rants concernant l\u2019article 7 de la Charte ne peut \u00eatre retenu, puisque les ordonnances judiciaires ne sont pas assujetties \u00e0 la Charte (art. 32 de la Charte; voir aussi Syndicat des d\u00e9taillants, grossistes et magasins \u00e0 rayons, section locale 580 [SDGMR] c. Dolphin Delivery Ltd [1986] 2 R.C.S. 573, par. 34 et 36 et McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, par. 157 et 158). \u00c9galement, il est bien \u00e9tabli que les droits \u00e9conomiques ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte, ce qui inclus les cotisations d\u2019imp\u00f4t (Gratl c. La Reine, 2012 CAF 88, par. 8). Il s\u2019ensuit donc que le d\u00e9lai pour obtenir une d\u00e9cision touchant \u00e0 un droit non vis\u00e9 par la Charte ne peut \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par celle-ci.\n[28] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les facteurs suivants militent en faveur de l\u2019option de rendre jugement sur dossiers : la preuve est close, les plaidoiries sont compl\u00e9t\u00e9es, les contre-interrogatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la satisfaction des parties, et la Cour a acc\u00e8s non seulement aux transcriptions, mais \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement sonore de l\u2019audience. De plus, la d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante fait \u00e9tat de r\u00e9elles difficult\u00e9s si la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait ordonn\u00e9e.\nVI. DISCUSSION LA REQU\u00caTE\n[29] Pour les motifs suivants, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\n[30] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour admettre les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus par la Cour elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures.\n[31] \u00c9galement, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif ne peut s\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9cisions ou ordonnances de la Cour relatives \u00e0 sa propre proc\u00e9dure, la Cour \u00e9tant un tribunal judiciaire. Toutefois, m\u00eame si la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif \u00e9tait applicable, la Cour conclut que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des options offertes aux parties pour continuer les dossiers ne portent pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c9galement, la Cour conclut que le d\u00e9lai judiciaire dans ces dossiers n\u2019est pas excessif.\nComp\u00e9tence de la Cour et doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire :\n[32] Pour les motifs suivants, autant les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s l\u00e9gislativement que les pouvoirs s\u2019inf\u00e9rant n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice (par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire) ne permettent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus par la Cour elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures.\n[33] Les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont cit\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9cision jurisprudentielle sur l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire qui donnerait par ailleurs pouvoir inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la Cour de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un abus par elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures en admettant les appels et annulant les cotisations. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les deux parties ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pu retracer aucune d\u00e9cision traitant de cette question. La raison en est bien simple, puisque la Cour n\u2019a tout simplement pas ce pouvoir.\n[34] La comp\u00e9tence de la Cour est fix\u00e9e par la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (LRC (1985), ch. T-2, telle que modifi\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12) et se limite :\n\u00ab .. \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 et le bienfond\u00e9 de la cotisation en fonction des dispositions applicables de la Loi \u2026 et des faits donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019obligation du contribuable pr\u00e9vue par la loi (Ereiser c. Canada, 2013 CAF 20, par. 31).\n[35] L\u2019article 171 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit les pouvoirs de la Cour dans le cadre d\u2019un appel d\u2019une cotisation sous la Loi :\n\u00ab La Cour peut statuer sur un appel en le rejetant ou en l\u2019admettant et en annulant la cotisation, ou en modifiant la cotisation ou en d\u00e9f\u00e9rant la cotisation au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation \u00bb.\n[36] Il est aussi bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour annuler une cotisation sur la base d\u2019un abus de pouvoir ou d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation (Canada (Revenu national) c. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 CAF 250, par. 83).\n[37] Dans l\u2019affaire Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd. c. La Reine, 2004 CAF 403 [Main Rehabilitation], par. 6, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il est \u00ab ...\u00e9vident et manifeste que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer qu\u2019un avis de cotisation est nul parce qu\u2019il constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure reconnu en common law ou en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Charte \u00bb. Tel que l\u2019indique la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il en est ainsi puisque l\u2019appel log\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 169 de la Loi met en cause la validit\u00e9 de la cotisation, et non pas le processus ayant conduit \u00e0 son \u00e9tablissement (par. 8).\n[38] En plus de la comp\u00e9tence fix\u00e9e l\u00e9gislativement, la Cour, comme tout autre tribunal judiciaire, poss\u00e8de tout pouvoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire. Ainsi, dans R. c. Cunningham, 2010 CSC 10 [Cunningham], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e ainsi:\n[19] De m\u00eame, dans le cas d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative, le pouvoir de faire respecter sa proc\u00e9dure et le droit de regard sur la mani\u00e8re dont les avocats exercent leurs fonctions s\u2019inf\u00e8rent n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice. Notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 que les pouvoirs d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une \u00ab doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb :\n. . . sont compris dans les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi habilitante non seulement ceux qui y sont express\u00e9ment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, mais aussi, par d\u00e9duction, tous ceux qui sont de fait n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif . . .\n(ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. c. Alberta (Energy and UtilitiesBoard), 2006 CSC 4, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 140, par. 51)\nM\u00eame si, dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge Bastarache renvoie \u00e0 un tribunal administratif, la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire vaut pour un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative.\n[mon soulignement]\n[39] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 ce principe dans l\u2019affaire High-Crest Enterprises Limited c. La Reine, 2017 CAF 88 [High-Crest] (par. 39).\n[40] Cette comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire permet au juge en chef de la Cour de r\u00e9assigner un dossier \u00e0 un autre juge de la Cour lorsqu\u2019un juge a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper sa charge (High-Crest, par. 17-40), ce que les requ\u00e9rants ont reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ne contestent pas.\n[41] Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9, par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, un juge de la Cour d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour continuer les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants peut d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en s\u2019assurant que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, qui pourrait \u00eatre de rendre jugement sur dossiers ou encore, d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame sans l\u2019accord des parties (D\u2019Amico, par. 44).\n[42] Par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, les juges de la Cour ont le pouvoir de faire respecter la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour et d\u2019avoir un droit de regard sur la mani\u00e8re dont les avocats exercent leurs fonctions, \u00e9tant un pouvoir s\u2019inf\u00e9rant n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice (Cunningham, par. 19).\n[43] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e ainsi:\n35 Les juges disposent, pour emp\u00eacher les abus de proc\u00e9dure, d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel inh\u00e9rent\u2026\n[44] Dans Toronto (ville de) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (S.C.F.P.), section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 [Ville de Toronto], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de common law comme des proc\u00e9dures injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et en un traitement oppressif et vise essentiellement \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la fonction judiciaire (Ville de Toronto, par. 35 et 43). De fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de common law y a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n37 \u2026Le juge Goudge a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 la notion de la fa\u00e7on suivante aux par. 55 et 56 :\n[TRADUCTION] La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure engage le pouvoir inh\u00e9rent du tribunal d\u2019emp\u00eacher que ses proc\u00e9dures soient utilis\u00e9es abusivement, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui serait manifestement injuste envers une partie au litige, ou qui aurait autrement pour effet de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019administration de la justice. C\u2019est une doctrine souple qui ne s\u2019encombre pas d\u2019exigences particuli\u00e8res telles que la notion d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 (voir House of Spring Gardens Ltd. c. Waite, [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347, p. 358, [1990] 2 All E.R. 990 (C.A.).\n[mon soulignement]\n[45] Ainsi, la Cour peut prendre toutes les mesures qu\u2019elle juge n\u00e9cessaires et appropri\u00e9es pour faire respecter la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour lorsqu\u2019une partie en abuse, et non pas lorsqu\u2019une partie pr\u00e9tend que c\u2019est la Cour elle-m\u00eame qui abuse de ses propres proc\u00e9dures. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Yacyshyn c. R. (1999), 99 D.T.C. 5133, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu abus de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour puisque l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations quant aux interrogatoires pr\u00e9alable et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour avait le pouvoir de radier certaines parties des all\u00e9gations contenues \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel (voir \u00e9galement Main Rehabilitation, par. 7).\n[46] Il serait aussi permis \u00e0 la Cour de mettre fin \u00e0 un litige dans le cas o\u00f9 une question aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement tranch\u00e9e (par exemple, s\u2019il y a chose jug\u00e9e).\n[47] Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir de la Cour de pr\u00e9venir et contr\u00f4ler un abus de ses proc\u00e9dures par l\u2019adjudication de frais et d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une des parties (Fournier c. Canada, 2005 CAF 131, par. 11).\n[48] Il est \u00e9galement permis \u00e0 la Cour de mettre fin \u00e0 un litige lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la cotisation \u00e9tablie hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus en violation de l\u2019article 8 de la Charte (Canada c. O\u2019Neill Motors Ltd. [1998] 4 F.C. 180 (C.A.)).\nL\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif\n[49] Les requ\u00e9rants demandent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appliquer la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des proc\u00e9dures mises en place par la Cour elle-m\u00eame pour la suite des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, et non pas en regard du comportement des autres parties au litige. En effet, dans le cadre de cette requ\u00eate, les requ\u00e9rants ne soul\u00e8vent aucun geste abusif ou vexatoire qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou l\u2019ARC, ou tout autre abus de proc\u00e9dure de la part de l\u2019autre partie au litige. Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent plut\u00f4t le d\u00e9lai qu\u2019a pris la Cour pour g\u00e9rer le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, qui r\u00e9sulterait selon eux en un abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif comme cette doctrine est appliqu\u00e9e en contexte administratif.\n[50] Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44 [Blencoe], dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable causant un pr\u00e9judice grave pouvait constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Ils invoquent \u00e9galement l\u2019arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Law Society of Saskatchewan et Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29 [Abrametz], dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada se penche \u00e0 nouveau sur la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif (par. 33-34).\n[51] Selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, il y a deux situations dans lesquelles un d\u00e9lai peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif: i) si l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience est compromise par le d\u00e9lai (si, par exemple, le d\u00e9lai nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une plainte, notamment si les souvenirs se sont estomp\u00e9s, des t\u00e9moins essentiels ne sont plus disponibles ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve perdus) (Blencoe, par. 101-102); et ii) dans les cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019y pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience, si un pr\u00e9judice important a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9lai excessif (Blencoe, par. 122 et 132).\n[52] Lorsque l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est constat\u00e9, les tribunaux doivent d\u00e9terminer les r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es, qui prennent diverses formes, et qui peuvent aller ultimement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures dans les cas les plus manifestes d\u2019abus (Abrametz, par. 74-76; 83-85).\n[53] Selon la Cour, le pouvoir que poss\u00e8de la Cour de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure ne peut permettre \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019annuler des nouvelles cotisations et d\u2019admettre des appels pour le motif du d\u00e9lai qu\u2019a pris la Cour \u00e0 g\u00e9rer un d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice commande qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans le cadre de ces appels. Comme l\u2019a plaid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, si la Cour convenait d\u2019admettre les appels des requ\u00e9rants et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations, cela choquerait le sens de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et \u00e9branlerait la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice (Abrametz, par. 76 et Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019immigration) c. Tobiass [1997] 3 R.C.S. 391, par. 96).\n[54] De plus, comme la Cour est un d\u00e9cideur judiciaire et non pas un d\u00e9cideur administratif et n\u2019est pas une partie au litige, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai en contexte administratif n\u2019est pas applicable. Les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants pour soutenir leurs arguments ne peuvent recevoir application, puisqu\u2019elles r\u00e9f\u00e8rent toutes \u00e0 la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif (Ville de Toronto, Blencoe et Abrametz).\n[55] La Cour souscrit aux commentaires de la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Lassonde c. R, 2003 CCI 715 aux par. 133, 134 et 141, maintenue en appel par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Lassonde c. Canada, 2005 CAF 323). Dans cette affaire, la Cour a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate du contribuable demandant que son appel soit admis et les cotisations annul\u00e9es pour le motif du d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable qu\u2019avait pris le ministre pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation et pour oppression. La Cour distingue les principes de la d\u00e9cision Blencoe et indique:\n[133] Une cotisation en vertu de la Loi n'est pas une plainte ni un acte d'accusation. Il s'agit tout simplement d'un acte constatant la dette d'un contribuable en vertu de la Loi, dans un syst\u00e8me d'autocotisation.\n[134] Dans la mati\u00e8re couverte par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il y a une partie qui je crois rel\u00e8ve du droit administratif et l'autre qui rel\u00e8ve de la proc\u00e9dure civile. La partie du droit administratif serait celle qui va de la d\u00e9claration de revenu jusqu'\u00e0 la cotisation. \u00c0 partir du moment o\u00f9 un appel d'une cotisation est institu\u00e9 devant notre Cour, qui est une cour de justice ou un tribunal civil, il ne s'agit plus de droit administratif mais de droit civil.\n\u2026.\n[141] Comme nous venons de le voir, une cotisation ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9e pour manque de diligence dans le traitement d'une cotisation. Une fois les proc\u00e9dures devant cette Cour entam\u00e9es, il appartient \u00e0 l'appelant de promouvoir l'audience de sa cause.\n[mon soulignement]\n[56] Toutefois, m\u00eame si la Cour concluait que la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai en contexte administratif \u00e9tait applicable \u00e0 notre Cour, les d\u00e9lais encourus dans le cadre des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants ne donnent pas ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019application de cette notion, non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la r\u00e9paration recherch\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants. En effet, la Cour conclut que si elle ordonnait la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, le d\u00e9lai encouru dans ces dossiers n\u2019affecterait pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience. De plus, la Cour conclut que le d\u00e9lai depuis la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ces appels n\u2019est pas excessif. En effet, les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de ces appels doivent \u00eatre prises en compte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour \u00e9valuer ce d\u00e9lai.\n[57] Les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu le 9 novembre 2017 et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas responsables du d\u00e9lai de 26 mois \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les mois de novembre 2017 et janvier 2020, puisque l\u2019appel log\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en octobre 2019 l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9ventive. Ainsi, selon les requ\u00e9rants, un d\u00e9lai de 53 mois s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des affaires en novembre 2017 et le moment o\u00f9 les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es du d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite de la juge pr\u00e9sidente, soit au mois de mars 2022.\n[58] La Cour ne peut retenir cette fa\u00e7on qu\u2019ont les requ\u00e9rants de calculer les d\u00e9lais. Tout d\u2019abord, le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u2019a pas commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir le 9 novembre 2017. La juge pr\u00e9sidente a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audition des appels qu\u2019elle mettait ces dossiers en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve de la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve, \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants, soit les requ\u00e9rants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n\u00ab \u2026 je vous remercie, et puis n\u00e9cessairement, je vais prendre \u00e7a sur d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, mais non seulement \u00e7a, il faut que j\u2019attende d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre qu\u2019on proc\u00e8de avec la requ\u00eate. \u00bb (transcriptions, 9 novembre 2017, p. 233, lignes 7 \u00e0 10).\n[59] De plus, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture du proc\u00e8s le lundi 30 octobre 2017, la juge pr\u00e9sidente a fait part de son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont avis\u00e9 la Cour de leur intention de pr\u00e9senter une telle requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire pour exclusion de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, soit par simple lettre envoy\u00e9e au greffe de la Cour le jeudi 26 octobre 2017, et ce, sans suivre les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour. De longues discussions se sont poursuivies le matin du 30 octobre 2017 quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der, soit d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audition des appels pr\u00e9vue pour deux semaines afin de permettre aux requ\u00e9rants de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme, avec affidavit et observations \u00e9crites, ou soit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition des appels, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019objection des requ\u00e9rants au d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par l\u2019ARC dans le cadre de la perquisition, \u00e9tant entendu que cette requ\u00eate serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et entendue \u00e0 un moment \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la Cour, en fonction de la disponibilit\u00e9 des parties, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition des appels. Comme la juge pr\u00e9sidente l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 :\n\u00ab C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle c\u2019est tr\u00e8s triste, mais on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019envers. Mais comme je vous dis, c\u2019est soit \u00e7a ou on ajourne tout et puis on revient l\u2019an prochain \u00bb (transcriptions, 30 octobre 2017, p. 74, lignes 7-10).\n[60] Les requ\u00e9rants ont convenu au proc\u00e8s que l\u2019audition des appels devait avoir lieu comme pr\u00e9vu et qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9senteraient leur requ\u00eate par la suite. Il est donc fort inappropri\u00e9 pour les requ\u00e9rants de se plaindre aujourd\u2019hui de ces d\u00e9lais.\n[61] La d\u00e9cision de la juge pr\u00e9sidente sur la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve, entendue en f\u00e9vrier 2019, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 29 ao\u00fbt 2019, et port\u00e9e en appel par les requ\u00e9rants en octobre 2019. L\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 20 janvier 2020, mais enregistr\u00e9e au greffe de la Cour qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de juillet 2021. Il faut noter que l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019aucune circonstance exceptionnelle ne justifie l\u2019intervention imm\u00e9diate de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, contrairement \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9tentions. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale indique \u00e9galement dans l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il \u00ab ..serait particuli\u00e8rement inappropri\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de retarder davantage l\u2019\u00e9mission du jugement au m\u00e9rite de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (CCI) sur le fond, surtout que celui-ci est attendu depuis d\u00e9j\u00e0 longtemps \u00bb.\n[62] De plus, environ 10 mois s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre le moment o\u00f9 les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s pour audition en d\u00e9cembre 2016 et le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition des appels le 30 octobre 2017. Toutefois, ce n\u2019est que deux jours avant la date du d\u00e9but du proc\u00e8s que les requ\u00e9rants indiquent leur intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire pour exclusion de preuve, par simple lettre envoy\u00e9e au greffe.\n[63] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les requ\u00e9rants ne peuvent aujourd\u2019hui se plaindre du d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les mois de novembre 2017 et janvier 2020.\n[64] \u00c9galement, la Cour conclut que 18 mois doivent \u00eatre soustraits du calcul du d\u00e9lai effectu\u00e9 par les requ\u00e9rants, soit le d\u00e9lai entre les mois de janvier 2020 (ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) et de juillet 2021 (enregistrement de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au plumitif de la Cour). En effet, entre les mois de janvier 2020 et juillet 2021, s\u2019apercevant que l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrite au plumitif de la Cour, les requ\u00e9rants auraient d\u00fb communiquer avec la Cour. Ce sera toutefois l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui s\u2019en chargera \u00e0 la fin du mois de juillet 2021 afin de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir du jugement au m\u00e9rite sur le fond dans ces appels.\n[65] Lorsque toutes les circonstances sont prises en consid\u00e9ration, il est fort \u00e9tonnant que les requ\u00e9rants maintiennent qu\u2019ils ne sont pas responsables des d\u00e9lais encourus dans leurs dossiers.\n[66] Ainsi, puisque la juge pr\u00e9sidente a quitt\u00e9 la Cour huit (8) mois apr\u00e8s l\u2019inscription au plumitif de la Cour de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour conclut que ce d\u00e9lai ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9lai excessif, comme l\u2019entend la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif.\n[67] Pour faire cette \u00e9valuation, le Cour a pris en compte les Principes de d\u00e9ontologie judiciaire \u00e9labor\u00e9s par le Conseil canadien de la magistrature qui pr\u00e9voit que, sauf circonstances particuli\u00e8res, les juges ayant mis une affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devraient rendre leur jugement dans les six mois qui suivent l\u2019audience (article 3.B.2).\nPROC\u00c9DURE \u00c0 SUIVRE POUR LA SUITE\n[68] Comme l\u2019indique la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision High-Crest, le nouveau juge saisi de l\u2019affaire d\u00e9terminera la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour la suite :\n[101] Apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9affectation, le nouveau juge est saisi de l\u2019affaire. Il appartient \u00e0 ce juge, et non au juge en chef, de recevoir les observations des parties concernant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019instance, par exemple, s\u2019il y a lieu de tenir une nouvelle audience ou si le dossier actuel (y compris les transcriptions) devrait servir en tout ou en partie (D\u2019Amico c. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785, 47 Alta. L.R. (5th) 414; Parmar c. Bayley, 2001 BCSC 1394, 19 C.P.C. (5th) 366).\n[69] Pour d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, la Cour doit s\u2019assurer que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, favorisant \u00ab la saine gestion de l\u2019instance en appliquant des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ad\u00e9quats, efficients par l\u2019application juste, simple, proportionn\u00e9e et \u00e9conomique de la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Schwimmer c. Gaudreault-Martel, 2022 QCCQ 1631 [Gaudreault-Martel], par. 52) tout en respectant le principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 (Gaudreault-Martel, par. 53) (observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9, par. 50-52). La Cour, comme tout autre tribunal, doit respecter les principes de justice naturelle et maintenir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[70] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour ordonne que jugement au m\u00e9rite sur le fond dans ces appels soit rendu sur la base des dossiers. Les parties pourront, si elles le souhaitent, soumettre des observations additionnelles orales et \u00e9crites quant aux questions en litige dans ces appels. La Cour se r\u00e9serve \u00e9galement le droit de rappeler tout t\u00e9moin.\n[71] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour conclut que la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s serait vraisemblablement in\u00e9quitable pour les requ\u00e9rants, puisque M. Plante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas d\u00e9bourser les honoraires juridiques estim\u00e9s par ses avocats pour la pr\u00e9paration et la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 38 et 39). Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 lui seul est d\u00e9cisif pour \u00e9carter l\u2019option de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s. De plus, la Cour a pris en compte le fait que de rappeler tous les t\u00e9moins pour t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 nouveau dans le cadre d\u2019un second proc\u00e8s ne serait pas ad\u00e9quat ni proportionn\u00e9. Puisque la Cour n\u2019ordonne pas la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, les pr\u00e9tentions des requ\u00e9rants \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les droits de M. Plante prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte seront bafou\u00e9s par la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ne seront pas examin\u00e9es.\n[72] Au cours de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, les requ\u00e9rants ont reconnu qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient aucun reproche \u00e0 formuler quant au processus suivi lors du proc\u00e8s tenu en octobre et novembre 2017, ce processus ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quitable. Les requ\u00e9rants ont \u00e9galement convenu que les interrogatoires et contre-interrogatoires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te lors de l\u2019audition des appels en 2017 (transcriptions, 28 avril 2023, p.23 (lignes 17-28) et p.24 (lignes 1 \u00e0 11)).\n[73] Ainsi, les dossiers de la Cour sont complets r\u00e9duisant toute iniquit\u00e9 : la preuve est close \u00e0 la satisfaction des parties (transcriptions, 3 novembre 2017, p. 182, lignes 19 \u00e0 21 pour les requ\u00e9rants, et transcriptions, 7 novembre 2017, p. 178, lignes 9 et 10 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9), et les plaidoiries sont termin\u00e9es. \u00c9galement, la Cour a acc\u00e8s aux transcriptions des audiences tant \u00e9crites que sonores, ce qui est un facteur privil\u00e9giant que la Cour rende jugement sur la base des dossiers (D\u2019Amico, par. 55 et 62).\n[74] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, les appels log\u00e9s par les requ\u00e9rants requi\u00e8rent qu\u2019un juge \u00e9value la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, cette \u00e9valuation \u00e9tant essentielle pour trancher les questions en litige dans ces dossiers. Le nouveau juge qui rendrait jugement sur la base des dossiers ne pourrait \u00e9valuer le langage corporel des t\u00e9moins, et ainsi, ce mode de fonctionnement ne peut se substituer au premier proc\u00e8s.\n[75] Les requ\u00e9rants ont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh c. Ministre de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration [1985] 1 R.C.S. 177 :\n59. Je ferai cependant remarquer que, m\u00eame si les auditions fond\u00e9es sur des observations \u00e9crites sont compatibles avec les principes de justice fondamentale pour certaines fins, elles ne donnent pas satisfaction dans tous les cas. Je pense en particulier que, lorsqu'une question importante de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est en cause, la justice fondamentale exige que cette question soit tranch\u00e9e par voie d'audition. Les cours d'appel sont bien conscientes de la faiblesse inh\u00e9rente des transcriptions lorsque des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont en jeu et elles sont donc tr\u00e8s peu dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9viser les conclusions des tribunaux qui ont eu l'avantage d'entendre les t\u00e9moins en personne: voir l'arr\u00eat Stein c. Le navire \u00ab Kathy K \u00bb, [1976] 2 R.C.S. 802, aux pp. 806 \u00e0 808 (le juge Ritchie). Je puis difficilement concevoir une situation o\u00f9 un tribunal peut se conformer \u00e0 la justice fondamentale en tirant, uniquement \u00e0 partir d'observations \u00e9crites, des conclusions importantes en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[mon soulignement]\n[76] Ces commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada datent de 1985 et ne prennent pas en compte la disponibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019enregistrement sonore des audiences, et qui sont disponibles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, bien qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour un juge de voir un t\u00e9moin, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ne s\u2019\u00e9value pas uniquement en \u00e9valuant le langage corporel des t\u00e9moins et peut s\u2019\u00e9valuer en examinant la d\u00e9position orale du t\u00e9moin (Francis c. La Reine, 2007 CCI 323, par. 15; Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334, par. 23; D\u2019Amico, par. 61 et 62).\n[77] Afin d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage, la Cour pourra, entre autre, tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants:\ni)les incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses de ce t\u00e9moignage \u2013 par exemple si le t\u00e9moignage change au cours du proc\u00e8s ou s\u2019il diff\u00e8re de celui rendu par d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins ou encore, s\u2019il diff\u00e8re de la preuve documentaire;\nii)les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences;\niii)les raisons que le t\u00e9moin pourrait avoir \u00e0 rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou \u00e0 induire la Cour en erreur;\niv)la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve : \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour peut rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[78] \u00c9galement, la Cour retient les commentaires \u00e9mis par le juge Stratas dans High-Crest :\n[116] En outre, la nature des affaires m\u00eames et le contexte dans lequel elles sont tranch\u00e9es comptent pour beaucoup. Les affaires o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 de la personne est en jeu, comme les affaires criminelles, celles o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages de vive voix sont nombreux et o\u00f9 les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont d\u00e9terminantes \u2014 au point o\u00f9 la reprise de l\u2019instance pourrait se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler injuste\u2014, et les affaires o\u00f9 la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative publique est contest\u00e9e appellent le juge en chef \u00e0 une grande prudence lorsqu\u2019il envisage de les r\u00e9affecter.\n[mon soulignement]\n[79] Les requ\u00e9rants ont \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que la juge pr\u00e9sidente avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile et complexe de se retrouver dans la preuve documentaire. Ils soul\u00e8vent donc que de demander \u00e0 un autre juge de comprendre toute la preuve et de rendre jugement sur la base des dossiers est un exercice p\u00e9rilleux pouvant mener \u00e0 une injustice pour les parties. La Cour ne peut retenir cet argument des requ\u00e9rants puisqu\u2019une r\u00e9vision attentive des transcriptions permettra \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019\u00e9valuer correctement la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue en octobre et novembre 2017 et de rendre jugement sur cette base.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 1e jour de juin 2023.\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nJuge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 79\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2015-1917(IT)G, 2015-1921(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nSPE VALEUR ASSURABLE INC. & ROBERT PLANTE ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nOttawa (Canada)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 28 Avril 2023\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE PAR :\nL'honorable juge Dominique Lafleur\nDATE DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE :\nLe 1 juin 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats des appelants :\nMe Gabriel Dumais\nMe Francis Fortin\nAvocat de l'intim\u00e9 :\nMe Vlad Zolia\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l'appelant:\nNom :\nCabinet :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

Introduction\n[1] Mme Sophie Payette (appelante) interjette appel de la d\u00e9cision de la ministre du Revenu national (Ministre) dat\u00e9e du 4 mai 2018 selon laquelle elle n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration) pendant la p\u00e9riode du 1er janvier 2016 au 17 mai 2016 (p\u00e9riode pertinente).\n[2] Entre 1988 et 1998, l\u2019appelante a occup\u00e9 divers postes \u00e0 la Caisse d\u2019Anjou. Par la suite, elle a saisi l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de travailler aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00e0 titre de formatrice pendant une p\u00e9riode de deux ou trois ans apr\u00e8s quoi elle est retourn\u00e9e travailler dans une caisse \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. En 2001, il y eut une fusion des caisses et le poste de l\u2019appelante fut aboli. Bien que l\u2019appelante avait fait demande pour un poste de coordonnatrice dans une caisse, elle a choisi de devenir repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, ce genre de travail lui paraissant vraiment int\u00e9ressant. Au d\u00e9but du processus de sa recherche de travail, l\u2019appelante a approch\u00e9 une ancienne coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qui \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire et celle-ci la mise en contact avec un cadre qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 les conditions de travail. L\u2019appelante a travaill\u00e9 comme repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire \u00e0 compter du 15 octobre 2001 jusqu\u2019au 17 mai 2016, date \u00e0 laquelle la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a r\u00e9sili\u00e9 son contrat.\n[3] G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, dans son r\u00f4le comme repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire, l\u2019appelante approchait des clients potentiels afin de leur proposer une offre de financement hypoth\u00e9caire et les inciter \u00e0 faire une demande de pr\u00eat aupr\u00e8s des Caisses Desjardins. Elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 commission. L\u2019appelante sollicitait des clients \u00e9ventuels aupr\u00e8s des courtiers immobiliers, des caisses et des contracteurs, en particulier dans le march\u00e9 des constructions neuves. Elle pr\u00e9parait des dossiers de pr\u00e9autorisation, les pr\u00eats hypoth\u00e9caires devant \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[4] En mars 2017, suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat, l\u2019appelante a fait une demande de d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son statut de travailleuse aux fins de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (LC 1996 c 23 [LAE]). La d\u00e9cision de la Ministre selon laquelle l\u2019appelante n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable fait l\u2019objet de ce litige.\nII. Question pr\u00e9liminaire - requ\u00eate\n[5] Le 5 janvier 2021, l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019annuler la d\u00e9cision de la Ministre au motif que l\u2019appel de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration en vertu de l\u2019article 91 de la LAE avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu et \u00e9tait donc ill\u00e9gal. La juge en chef adjointe a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette requ\u00eate serait entendue par la juge du proc\u00e8s.\n[6] Il convient de noter que, suite \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019appelante concernant l\u2019assurabilit\u00e9 de son emploi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 90 de la LAE, l\u2019Agence du revenu (ARC) a rendu une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision le 18 mai 2017 selon laquelle l\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00e9tait un emploi assurable. L\u2019article 91 de la LAE pr\u00e9voit que tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9 peut porter appel d\u2019une telle d\u00e9cision dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle il re\u00e7oit notification de la d\u00e9cision.\n[7] Le 3 novembre 2017, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019ARC pour indiquer qu\u2019elle faisait appel de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 18 mai 2017 et demandait d\u2019\u00eatre relev\u00e9e du d\u00e9faut de porter la d\u00e9cision en appel dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours. La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nDans un premier temps, nous demandons \u00e0 ce que notre cliente, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, soit relev\u00e9e du d\u00e9faut de porter cette d\u00e9cision en appel dans les 90 jours suivant sa notification. En effet, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de l\u2019appel de monsieur Sylvain Marceau de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada \u00e0 la mi-octobre 2017 qui demandait de r\u00e9gulariser la situation concernant madame Sophie Payette, que notre cliente s\u2019est rendu (sic) compte de l\u2019existence de cette correspondance et son absence de suivi.\nAussi, nous soulignons que notre cliente a toujours eu l\u2019intention de contester cette d\u00e9cision, tel qu\u2019il appert de sa contestation log\u00e9e dans un dossier identique qui est pr\u00e9sentement en r\u00e9vision devant la Division des appels.\nDans ce contexte, nous vous soumettons respectueusement que notre demande d\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre recevable et notre cliente devrait \u00eatre relev\u00e9e de son d\u00e9faut de ne pas avoir contest\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai imparti par la Loi. En cas contraire, notre cliente en subirait un pr\u00e9judice important et irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable.\n[8] Selon les notes d\u2019une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2017 entre l\u2019ARC et une repr\u00e9sentante de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, la lettre informant la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la d\u00e9cision du 18 mai 2017 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal class\u00e9e, soit class\u00e9e dans le dossier concernant un appel de la m\u00eame nature. Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2017, l\u2019ARC a avis\u00e9 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration que sur la base de ses explications, elle a conclu que l\u2019appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours de la notification de la d\u00e9cision.\n[9] Le 4 mai 2018, suite au traitement de cet appel, la Ministre a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du 18 mai 2017, concluant que l\u2019appelante n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable. L\u2019appelante a fait appel devant cette Cour. Le 22 octobre 2019, le juge Tardif a accueilli l\u2019appel infirmant ainsi la d\u00e9cision de la Ministre et concluant que l\u2019appelante occupait un emploi assurable (Payette c MRN, 2019 CCI 235). La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a fait appel de cette d\u00e9cision et le 26 octobre 2020, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a retourn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cette Cour pour reconsid\u00e9ration, par une autre juge de la Cour (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec c MRN et Sophie Payette, 2020 CAF 182).\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, la Cour a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate. Je note que la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en janvier 2021 demandant l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision de la Ministre dat\u00e9e du 4 mai 2018 survient apr\u00e8s les nombreuses \u00e9tapes mentionn\u00e9es ci-haut. Selon l\u2019appelante, puisque la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a re\u00e7u la lettre communiquant la d\u00e9cision du 18 mai 2017, elle a re\u00e7u la notification et elle n\u2019a pas fait appel dans le d\u00e9lai imparti. L\u2019appelante soutient que l\u2019ARC a outrepass\u00e9 ses droits en acceptant l\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 plus de 90 jours apr\u00e8s la date de la d\u00e9cision.\n[11] Selon l\u2019intervenante, l\u2019appelante aurait d\u00fb contester formellement la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ARC communiqu\u00e9e dans sa lettre du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2017, selon laquelle elle concluait que l\u2019appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit et il est maintenant trop tard. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelante aurait pu demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019accepter l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, affaire qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, la Cour a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate.\nDisposition de la requ\u00eate\n[12] Il convient de rappeler sommairement le contexte de la requ\u00eate. Les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 plus de 90 jours suivant la lettre dat\u00e9e du 18 mai 2017 avisant la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la d\u00e9cision prise quant \u00e0 l\u2019assurabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi en question. Suite aux explications fournies par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2017, l\u2019ARC a inform\u00e9 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u2019elle acceptait que son avis d\u2019appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours suivant la notification de la d\u00e9cision. L\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante est de demander \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019annuler cette d\u00e9cision.\n[13] La premi\u00e8re question est celle de savoir quelle est la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour pour d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ARC d\u2019accepter l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration dat\u00e9e du 3 novembre 2017. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision qui rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Ministre dont la contestation doit se faire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sous forme de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Il appert que la repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante a tent\u00e9 de contester cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 quelques reprises, mais non pas sous forme de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure applicables, il est trop tard pour demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Je note que depuis cette d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ARC, il s\u2019est pass\u00e9 bon nombre de choses dans ce dossier, soit, une audition sur le fond devant le juge Tardif de cette Cour, un appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale renvoyant l\u2019affaire devant cette Cour pour \u00eatre entendue de nouveau par une autre juge. Dans les circonstances, la requ\u00eate fut rejet\u00e9e et l\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu sur le fond.\nIII. Question en litige\n[14] La question en litige est celle de savoir si l\u2019appelante occupait un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intervenante pour la p\u00e9riode pertinente conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LAE. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si elle ex\u00e9cutait son travail de repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intervenante en vertu d\u2019un contrat de travail (donc \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9) ou en vertu de contrat d\u2019entreprise (donc \u00e0 titre de travailleuse ind\u00e9pendante).\nIV. Droit applicable\n[15] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) de la LAE pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019un \u00ab emploi assurable \u00bb inclut un \u00ab emploi exerc\u00e9 au Canada pour un ou plusieurs employeurs, aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services \u00bb sans toutefois d\u00e9finir ce qu\u2019est un contrat de louage de services. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) se lit comme suit :\n5(1) Sens de emploi assurable\u2014Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), est un emploi assurable:\na) l\u2019emploi exerc\u00e9 au Canada pour un ou plusieurs employeurs, aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services ou d\u2019apprentissage expr\u00e8s ou tacite, \u00e9crit ou verbal, que l\u2019employ\u00e9 re\u00e7oive sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019employeur ou d\u2019une autre personne et que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit calcul\u00e9e soit au temps ou aux pi\u00e8ces, soit en partie au temps et en partie aux pi\u00e8ces, soit de toute autre mani\u00e8re; [\u2026]\n[nous soulignons]\n[16] Puisque les faits de cette affaire se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec, il faut recourir au droit priv\u00e9 applicable au Qu\u00e9bec en mati\u00e8re de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de droits civils pour interpr\u00e9ter le contrat entre l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il y a lieu de rappeler l\u2019article 8.1 de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation (LRC 1985 c I-21) lequel reconnait la compl\u00e9mentarit\u00e9 du droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et du droit f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette approche dans les affaires 9041-6868 Qu\u00e9bec inc c Canada (MRN) (2005 CAF 334 [9041]), Grimard c Canada (2009 CAF 47 [Grimard]) et Ray-Mont Logistiques Montr\u00e9al inc c Canada (2020 CAF 113).\n[17] Or, en interpr\u00e9tant le contrat entre l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration afin de d\u00e9terminer si nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un contrat de louage de services, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, d\u2019un contrat de travail ou plut\u00f4t d\u2019un contrat d\u2019entreprise, il faut tenir compte des articles 1425, 1426, 2085, 2086, 2098, 2099 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (RLRQ c CCQ-1991 [Code civil]; voir l\u2019Annexe A ci-dessous).\n[18] L\u2019article 2085 du Code civil pr\u00e9voit comme suit :\n2085. Le contrat de travail est celui par lequel une personne, le salari\u00e9, s\u2019oblige, pour un temps limit\u00e9 et moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, \u00e0 effectuer un travail sous la direction ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019une autre personne, l\u2019employeur.\n[nous soulignons]\n[19] Or, selon l\u2019article 2085 du Code civil, les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs suivants caract\u00e9risent le contrat de travail (voir 9041 au para 11):\ni) une prestation de travail;\nii) une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration; et\niii) la direction ou le contr\u00f4le par l\u2019employeur, soit un lien de subordination.\n[20] Il est \u00e9galement instructif de consid\u00e9rer les articles 2098 et 2099 du Code civil concernant le contrat d\u2019entreprise qui pr\u00e9voit comme suit :\n2098.Le contrat d\u2019entreprise ou de service est celui par lequel une personne, selon le cas l\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services, s\u2019engage envers une autre personne, le client, \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un ouvrage mat\u00e9riel ou intellectuel ou \u00e0 fournir un service moyennant un prix que le client s\u2019oblige \u00e0 lui payer.\n2099. L\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services a le libre choix des moyens d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat et il n\u2019existe entre lui et le client aucun lien de subordination quant \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution.\n[nous soulignons]\n[21] Il ressort du droit applicable expos\u00e9 ci-haut que le lien de subordination est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant qui distingue le contrat de travail du contrat d\u2019entreprise. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a fait du travail pour la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il s\u2019ensuit que la question d\u00e9terminante est celle de savoir si l\u2019appelante a effectu\u00e9 son travail sous la direction et le contr\u00f4le de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, ou exprim\u00e9 autrement, s\u2019il y a un lien de subordination entre l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[22] Dans l\u2019analyse du contrat, il faut rechercher l\u2019intention commune entre les parties en tenant compte de la nature du contrat, des circonstances dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que les parties lui ont donn\u00e9e ou qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u ainsi que des usages comme le requi\u00e8rent les articles 1425 et 1426 du Code civil.\n[23] Je note que dans l\u2019affaire Grimard (paras 28 et 43), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence de conceptualisation entre le r\u00e9gime de common law et celui du droit civil, au niveau de l\u2019approche, mais a aussi exprim\u00e9 le point de vue selon lequel il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019erreur lorsqu\u2019un tribunal tient compte des crit\u00e8res de common law comme indices d\u2019encadrement pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a un lien de subordination, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un contr\u00f4le du travail. La Cour s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e comme suit :\n43 En somme, il n\u2019y a pas, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u2019antinomie entre les principes du droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et les soi-disant crit\u00e8res de common law utilis\u00e9s pour qualifier la nature juridique de la relation de travail entre deux parties. Dans la recherche d\u2019un lien de subordination juridique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de ce contr\u00f4le du travail, exig\u00e9 par le droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec pour l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat de travail, aucune erreur ne r\u00e9sulte du fait que le tribunal prenne en compte, comme indices d\u2019encadrement, les autres crit\u00e8res mis de l\u2019avant par la common law, soit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des outils, l\u2019expectative de profits et les risques de pertes, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9gration dans l\u2019entreprise.\n[24] Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que tant la jurisprudence \u00e9manant du droit civil que celle \u00e9manant de la common law pr\u00e9cisent qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9terminer la nature juridique de la relation globale que les parties entretiennent entre elles (Grimard au para 67; 671122 Ontario Ltd c Sagaz Industries Canada Inc, 2001 CSC 59 au para 46 [Sagaz]). Or, aucun crit\u00e8re universel ne permet de d\u00e9terminer le statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 ou de travailleur ind\u00e9pendant, aucun facteur particulier ne joue un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant, et il n\u2019y a pas de formule magique qu\u2019on puisse appliquer pour d\u00e9terminer la nature juridique de la relation dans une situation donn\u00e9e (voir Sagaz au para 46). Or, outre le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par l\u2019employeur, les facteurs habituellement pertinents \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration comprennent les points de savoir si le travailleur \u00ab fournit lui-m\u00eame son outillage, engage ses assistants, g\u00e8re et assume des risques financiers, et peut escompter un profit de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches \u00bb (1392644 Ontario Inc c Canada (Revenu National), 2013 CAF 85, para 41 [Connor Homes], para 41).\nV. Preuve et analyse\n[25] Il convient de rappeler que les parties ne contestent pas que l\u2019appelante a fourni une prestation de travail et qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Seul le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif caract\u00e9risant un contrat de travail, le crit\u00e8re de la direction et du contr\u00f4le, soit le lien de subordination, fait l\u2019objet du litige.\nA. Circonstances dans lesquelles la relation s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e\n[26] M. \u00c9ric Trudeau, directeur r\u00e9gional pour le financement hypoth\u00e9caire aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par l\u2019intervenante. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que les caisses, toutes ind\u00e9pendantes l\u2019une de l\u2019autre, ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se regrouper pour cr\u00e9er la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et centraliser certains services, tels les services de financement hypoth\u00e9caire. M. Trudeau a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait responsable d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de conseillers en d\u00e9veloppement des affaires (CDA) et \u00e0 leur tour, ceux-ci jouaient un r\u00f4le d\u2019appui aupr\u00e8s des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires. Les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires qui offrent leurs services \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration font le d\u00e9marchage de nouvelles opportunit\u00e9s et pr\u00e9parent les dossiers de financement hypoth\u00e9caire. Une fois les formulaires compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 3.2 du contrat, les repr\u00e9sentants soumettent les dossiers pour approbation au centre de financement de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration afin de qualifier l\u2019emprunteur, apr\u00e8s quoi le pr\u00eat est envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une caisse qui prend la relation d\u2019affaires en charge. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir pourquoi les repr\u00e9sentants ne pouvaient pas autoriser le financement hypoth\u00e9caire eux-m\u00eames, M. Trudeau a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait pour \u00e9viter le conflit qui r\u00e9sulte du fait de permettre au repr\u00e9sentant de prendre la d\u00e9cision d\u2019octroyer ou non le financement alors que son revenu d\u00e9pend de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[27] Selon M. Trudeau, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas d\u2019exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9alable fixe exig\u00e9e pour devenir repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration cherche des gens qui ont un fort profil entrepreneurial puisque les repr\u00e9sentants sont enti\u00e8rement responsables du d\u00e9veloppement de leurs affaires. Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que, contrairement aux courtiers hypoth\u00e9caires qui sont non exclusifs \u00e0 un seul pr\u00eateur et qui doivent d\u00e9tenir un permis en courtage hypoth\u00e9caire, les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration sont exclusifs et ne sont pas tenus de d\u00e9tenir un tel permis.\n[28] Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, suite \u00e0 l\u2019abolition du poste qu\u2019elle occupait \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une caisse, l\u2019appelante avait un choix \u00e0 faire quant au travail qu\u2019elle effectuerait \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, elle a choisi de devenir repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire en raison du d\u00e9fi que cela repr\u00e9sentait et parce que \u00e7a lui semblait vraiment int\u00e9ressant. L\u2019appelante a eu des discussions avec M. Mario Rivest, cadre aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 les conditions de travail. L\u2019appelante a compris qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire, elle serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 commission sans aucune garantie d\u2019une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration minimale et sans avantages sociaux. Elle a sign\u00e9 un premier contrat avec la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration en 2001, contrat qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau chaque ann\u00e9e jusqu\u2019en 2016 (Pi\u00e8ces A-3 et I-4). L\u2019appelante a expliqu\u00e9 que le montant des commissions gagn\u00e9es, lesquelles \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es au moment de l\u2019autorisation du pr\u00eat hypoth\u00e9caire, ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil des ans; au d\u00e9but, elle n\u2019atteignait pas les 100 000 $, mais entre 2003 et 2007, elle touchait des commissions d\u2019environ 150 000 $. L\u2019appelante a indiqu\u00e9 que les commissions qu\u2019elle gagnait ont diminu\u00e9 lorsque la conjoncture \u00e9conomique a affect\u00e9 le march\u00e9 des constructions neuves, la source de 95 % de ses clients \u00e0 certains moments. L\u2019appelante a ajout\u00e9 que ses revenus ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s lorsque les caisses ont mis en place des postes d\u2019employ\u00e9s d\u00e9di\u00e9s au recrutement pour le financement hypoth\u00e9caire puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 aussi d\u2019une des sources de sa client\u00e8le.\nB. Intention des parties et interpr\u00e9tation du contrat\n[29] Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat entre l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, on doit chercher l\u2019intention commune des parties. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration avaient l\u2019intention subjective de conclure un contrat de service (contrat d\u2019entreprise) et non pas un contrat de travail (contrat d\u2019emploi).\n[30] La clause 4.4 du contrat pr\u00e9voit que le repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire doit assumer tous les co\u00fbts, d\u00e9penses ou frais reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son contrat de service alors que la clause 6.1 pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019aucun lien de subordination n\u2019est cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et le repr\u00e9sentant du fait de la pr\u00e9sente convention. On ajoute, \u00e0 la clause 6.2 que chaque partie paiera ses propres imp\u00f4ts, taxes et droits. La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a remis des feuillets T4A (Revenu de pension, de retraite, de rente ou d\u2019autres sources) \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et n\u2019a fait aucune d\u00e9duction \u00e0 la source sur les commissions vers\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\n[31] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019appelante a reconnu que le repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration lui avait dit clairement qu\u2019elle serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 commission, sans revenu minimal garanti et sans avantages sociaux. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e dans le pass\u00e9 et comprenait bien ce qu\u2019elle perdait en termes d\u2019avantages sociaux, ayant eu droit par le pass\u00e9 \u00e0 des avantages tels des r\u00e9gimes d\u2019assurance et de pension. Lors de ses discussions avec un repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, l\u2019appelante a compris qu\u2019elle serait \u00ab \u00e0 contrat \u00bb et qu\u2019elle pourrait d\u00e9duire des d\u00e9penses \u00e0 titre de travailleuse autonome. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle remplissait ses d\u00e9clarations de revenu \u00e0 titre de travailleuse autonome, d\u00e9duisant, dans le calcul de son revenu, ses d\u00e9penses, y compris les frais engag\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 un bureau \u00e0 domicile, \u00e0 l\u2019usage de sa voiture et \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9. Je note que dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 16 mars 2017 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ARC relativement \u00e0 sa demande de statut de travailleur, elle a \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab engag\u00e9e par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00e0 titre de travailleur autonome r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 commission \u00bb et elle a expliqu\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord.\n[32] Il importe de noter que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 signer un nouveau contrat chaque ann\u00e9e. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle l\u2019a sign\u00e9e chaque ann\u00e9e sans jamais demander la modification d\u2019une clause parce qu\u2019elle sentait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de choix, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, si elle ne signait pas le contrat, elle n\u2019aurait pas pu continuer \u00e0 travailler comme repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire. \u00c0 mon avis, cet \u00e9tat des choses peut indiquer une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de pouvoir de n\u00e9gociation de la relation d\u2019affaires, mais n\u2019est pas en soi indicateur d\u2019un lien de subordination. Tout travailleur autonome qui refuse de signer un contrat avec le donneur d\u2019ouvrage pourra se retrouver sans travail donn\u00e9 par ce payeur; cela ne fait pas de lui un employ\u00e9 du payeur. Je conclus que selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, l\u2019intention commune des parties \u00e9tait de conclure un contrat de service.\nC. Direction et contr\u00f4le par le payeur \u2013 Lien de subordination\n[33] Il faut maintenant examiner la relation globale qu\u2019entretenaient l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective confirme l\u2019intention subjective qu\u2019avaient les parties de conclure un contrat de service.\nHoraire, outils de travail et services d\u2019une adjointe\n[34] L\u2019appelante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle effectuait la majeure partie de son travail \u00e0 partir de sa voiture. Elle se rendait chez ses clients, \u00e0 leur domicile ou \u00e0 leur lieu de travail. Elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait libre d\u2019organiser son horaire et de d\u00e9terminer avec ses clients quand elle allait les rencontrer. La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration ne tenait aucunement compte des heures travaill\u00e9es et ne g\u00e9rait pas son agenda. Cela dit, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration avait une attente que les repr\u00e9sentants allaient rappeler les clients dans les 24 \u00e0 48 heures suivant l\u2019appel.\n[35] L\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019autorisation de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 des rendez-vous personnels ni pour prendre des vacances. M. Arnaud Guillaumont, aujourd\u2019hui repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire et t\u00e9moin convoqu\u00e9 par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, a confirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA, les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires ne lui demandaient aucune autorisation pour s\u2019absenter. Cela dit, si l\u2019appelante voulait s\u2019absenter, elle devait prendre des arrangements pour que quelqu\u2019un s\u2019occupe de ses dossiers. Dans ces cas, elle concluait une entente avec une autre repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire et les deux s\u2019entendaient sur le partage de la commission qui pouvait r\u00e9sulter du travail pris en charge.\n[36] L\u2019appelante a reconnu que les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires avaient le droit de retenir les services d\u2019une adjointe. En fait, l\u2019appelante a travaill\u00e9 avec Mme Vanessa Dufresne, l\u2019adjointe d\u2019une autre repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire qu\u2019elle rempla\u00e7ait pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. L\u2019appelante a confirm\u00e9 que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des adjointes ni ne les payait elle. C\u2019est l\u2019appelante qui a pay\u00e9 Mme Dufresne et elle a d\u00e9duit ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu. Mme France Poirier, une adjointe qui rendait des services \u00e0 divers repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires et t\u00e9moin convoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, n\u2019a fait que confirmer le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. M. Guillaumont, qui travaille avec une adjointe, a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire veut retenir les services d\u2019une adjointe, il doit communiquer avec son CDA afin que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration puisse faire une v\u00e9rification de cr\u00e9dit et des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires de cette personne. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration avec son adjointe et c\u2019est lui qui la paie. Il a aussi confirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA, il n\u2019intervenait pas aupr\u00e8s des adjointes.\n[37] La clause 4.5 du contrat pr\u00e9voit que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration s\u2019engageait \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019appelante, un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone intelligent normalis\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9quipement informatique sur lequel les logiciels de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s. Toutefois, selon l\u2019article 9 et l\u2019annexe B du Guide des processus d\u2019affaires et op\u00e9rationnels des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires Desjardins (Guide, pi\u00e8ce A-4), l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait responsable des frais mensuels fix\u00e9s par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour l\u2019utilisation des \u00e9quipements informatiques et t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et les services de connexion au r\u00e9seau Desjardins. L\u2019appelante a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait responsable de ces frais. Mme Grandchamp, une repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire et t\u00e9moin convoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle payait les frais li\u00e9s au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et \u00e0 l\u2019ordinateur. M. Trudeau a expliqu\u00e9 que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fournissait les ordinateurs pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des logiciels et des renseignements.\nL\u2019\u00e9tablissement des objectifs, les r\u00e9unions avec les CDA et les \u00e9valuations\n[38] Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont discut\u00e9 du r\u00f4le des CDA et leur lien avec les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires. Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, les CDA sont des employ\u00e9s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qui jouent un r\u00f4le d\u2019appui aupr\u00e8s des repr\u00e9sentants. En interrogatoire, l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9cisive dans ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions pos\u00e9es par sa repr\u00e9sentante concernant les objectifs qu\u2019elle devait atteindre et qui les fixait. Elle a dit, \u00e0 la fois, que les objectifs \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s par le CDA, mais a aussi dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision commune prise par la repr\u00e9sentante et le CDA. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que si elle n\u2019atteignait pas ses objectifs, il arrivait que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration ajoute une autre repr\u00e9sentante dans son secteur pour augmenter le volume des ventes. Outre cela, l\u2019appelante a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de cons\u00e9quences en tant que telles si elle n\u2019atteignait pas ses objectifs. L\u2019appelante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois, lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas atteint ses objectifs \u00e0 cause du ralentissement dans le march\u00e9 de la construction neuve, son CDA lui a propos\u00e9 d\u2019agrandir son territoire et de chercher d\u2019autres occasions d\u2019affaires. Elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais fait l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires au cours de ses quinze ann\u00e9es comme repr\u00e9sentante aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle parlait \u00e0 son CDA une ou deux fois par semaine, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait habitu\u00e9e de travailler seule et que c\u2019\u00e9tait rare qu\u2019elle faisait appel \u00e0 son CDA, mais que son CDA pouvait l\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer les choses lorsque l\u2019approbation d\u2019un dossier de financement hypoth\u00e9caire tardait.\n[39] L\u2019appelante a aussi discut\u00e9 des r\u00e9unions mensuelles organis\u00e9es par les CDA auxquelles elle se sentait oblig\u00e9e de participer. Il s\u2019agissait de r\u00e9unions lors desquelles on informait les repr\u00e9sentants des mises \u00e0 jour dans la r\u00e8glementation et on invitait des gens \u00e0 venir faire des pr\u00e9sentations, par exemple sur les strat\u00e9gies de ventes. L\u2019appelante a expliqu\u00e9 que lors de ces r\u00e9unions, on parlait aussi du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires, du taux de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration des divers bureaux et on affichait les r\u00e9sultats de ventes des repr\u00e9sentants.\n[40] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Guillaumont a affirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA, il avait des objectifs \u00e0 rencontrer pour son territoire, lesquels \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s pas sa direction. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait alors une discussion informelle avec les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires dans son \u00e9quipe de quinze \u00e0 vingt, pour voir quelles \u00e9taient leurs intentions quant \u00e0 leurs objectifs; cela lui permettait de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il devait signer des contrats avec d\u2019autres repr\u00e9sentants pour qu\u2019il puisse atteindre ses objectifs. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Trudeau a confirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA, il eut ce genre de discussion avec les repr\u00e9sentants pour voir quelles \u00e9taient leurs ambitions, leur app\u00e9tit pour le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires et dans le but que les repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9tablissent une cible. Tant M. Guillaumont que M. Trudeau ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de cons\u00e9quences si un repr\u00e9sentant n\u2019atteignait pas ses objectifs. Cela dit, M. Guillaumont a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant n\u2019atteignait pas sa cible, il discutait avec lui afin de d\u00e9terminer ce qui allait moins bien, et de lui donner des trucs et lui fournir des outils qui pourraient aider \u00e0 augmenter le volume de ventes. Il a confirm\u00e9 que lors des r\u00e9unions, qu\u2019il ne consid\u00e9rait aucunement comme obligatoires, les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient discut\u00e9s. Selon lui, les repr\u00e9sentants, \u00e9tant des vendeurs, sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par les r\u00e9sultats ainsi qu'o\u00f9 ils se situent par rapport \u00e0 leurs coll\u00e8gues. Il profitait de cette occasion pour encourager les repr\u00e9sentants.\n[41] La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une firme externe, faisait des sondages al\u00e9atoires avec des clients qui avaient transig\u00e9 avec des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires pour obtenir de la r\u00e9troaction sur leur exp\u00e9rience, sondages appel\u00e9s les TNR (taux nets de recommandation). La repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante a donn\u00e9 l\u2019exemple suivant comme question pouvant \u00eatre pos\u00e9e dans le sondage : \u00ab Sur une \u00e9chelle de 1 \u00e0 10, quelle est la probabilit\u00e9 que vous recommandiez Desjardins \u00e0 un ami ou \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue \u00bb.\n[42] Les CDA recevaient les r\u00e9sultats de ces sondages et lorsque les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient faibles, pouvaient contacter le repr\u00e9sentant pour en discuter. M. Guillaumont a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils recevaient les r\u00e9sultats alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA et qu\u2019il lui est arriv\u00e9 de contacter un repr\u00e9sentant pour en discuter et offrir des conseils. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire, il avait aussi re\u00e7u les r\u00e9sultats de tels sondages ajoutant que cela lui donnait des informations utiles sur la qualit\u00e9 des services rendus.\nRisques financiers, profits et d\u00e9clarations de revenu\n[43] L\u2019appelante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9part, son objectif \u00e9tait de gagner des commissions de l\u2019ordre de 50 000 $ sachant qu\u2019elle devait d\u2019abord faire du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires, et que les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, ses commissions n\u2019atteignaient pas les 100 000 $. Au fil des prochaines ann\u00e9es, ses commissions ont augment\u00e9 \u00e0 100 000 $, 150 000 $ et au-del\u00e0. Je note que M. Guillaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait CDA, les commissions gagn\u00e9es par les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires variaient entre 100 000 $ et 300 000 $.\n[44] Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019article 4.4 du contrat pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019appelante devait assumer tous les co\u00fbts, d\u00e9penses et frais reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante assumait les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es pour faire le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires et gagner son revenu de commission, par exemple, les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019usage de sa voiture, les frais de publicit\u00e9, les frais de repr\u00e9sentation et les co\u00fbts relatifs au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipement informatique. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019elle remettait ses documents \u00e0 sa comptable pour la pr\u00e9paration de sa d\u00e9claration de revenu, elle lui remettait ses factures et d\u00e9clarait son revenu \u00e0 titre de travailleuse autonome. Il convient de noter que l\u2019appelante ne s\u2019est pas constitu\u00e9e en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exig\u00e9. Elle s\u2019est enregistr\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du Registre des entreprises du Qu\u00e9bec apr\u00e8s avoir agi \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire pendant une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elle voulait changer sa ligne t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et elle avait besoin d\u2019un num\u00e9ro d\u2019enregistrement d\u2019entreprise pour ce faire.\n[45] L\u2019appelante a reconnu qu\u2019il se peut qu\u2019un dossier de financement qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 ne soit pas approuv\u00e9 de sorte que pour ce dossier-l\u00e0, elle subirait une perte puisque la commission n\u2019est pay\u00e9e que lorsque la demande de financement hypoth\u00e9caire est approuv\u00e9e. Bien que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible, elle n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 avoir subi de pertes pendant la p\u00e9riode pour laquelle elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire. \u00c0 mon avis, il \u00e9tait possible pour l\u2019appelante de subir des pertes et surtout, il \u00e9tait possible de faire des profits; plus elle augmentait son volume de ventes de financement hypoth\u00e9caire, mais aussi de tous les autres produits Desjardins, plus ses commissions pouvaient augmenter. Et, la nature du travail fait en sorte que les commissions pouvaient fluctuer, non seulement en raison de l\u2019effort, mais aussi en raison des changements dans la conjoncture \u00e9conomique, et elles ont fluctu\u00e9.\nExclusivit\u00e9 et cadre r\u00e8glementaire\n[46] La clause 5.1 du contrat pr\u00e9voit que le repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire acceptait de rendre des services exclusifs \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et aux caisses pour le traitement et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du cr\u00e9dit hypoth\u00e9caire. L\u2019appelante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, contrairement aux courtiers hypoth\u00e9caires, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire, elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de vendre des produits d\u2019institutions bancaires autres que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[47] La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a convoqu\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin M. Philip Ward, directeur principal, financement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 et solutions de paiements au moment du proc\u00e8s, mais ayant occup\u00e9 divers postes aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration auparavant. M. Ward a affirm\u00e9 que dans toutes les institutions financi\u00e8res, les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires sont exclusifs \u00e0 leur institution et en outre, que cela est prescrit par la Loi sur le courtage immobilier, la l\u00e9gislation applicable \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pertinente, une nouvelle loi \u00e9tant d\u00e9sormais applicable. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration devait faire preuve qu\u2019elle avait mis des pratiques et des proc\u00e9dures en place pour assurer qu\u2019elle suit les principes directeurs applicables \u00e0 la pratique de souscription des pr\u00eats hypoth\u00e9caires r\u00e9sidentiels tels qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les lignes directrices de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF) et du Bureau du surintendant des institutions financi\u00e8res (BSIF). M. Ward a ajout\u00e9 que ces lignes directrices sont reprises dans le Guide.\n[48] La repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante soutient que c\u2019est la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et non la r\u00e8glementation qui impose l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 des services fournis. Selon ma compr\u00e9hension de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il semble clair que les repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires qui ne sont pas des courtiers sont chapeaut\u00e9s par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et ne peuvent pas vendre des produits d\u2019autres institutions. Cela dit, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache un courtier de choisir de conclure un contrat comme celui sign\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante et devenir repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire. Un tel repr\u00e9sentant serait assujetti \u00e0 la clause d\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 5.1 bien qu\u2019il aurait, en principe, \u00e0 titre de courtier assujetti aux r\u00e8gles de la pratique, le droit de vendre des produits de diverses institutions financi\u00e8res. En fait, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Trudeau a confirm\u00e9 que pour \u00eatre non exclusif \u00e0 une institution, il faut \u00eatre courtier et d\u00e9tenir un permis de courtage hypoth\u00e9caire alors que pour \u00eatre repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9tenir un tel permis. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que de 10 \u00e0 15 % des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration d\u00e9tiennent un permis de courtage hypoth\u00e9caire qui leur permettrait de vendre des produits de diverses institutions.\n[49] Que ce soit un choix de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une obligation d\u00e9coulant de la l\u00e9gislation applicable, je constate que pour la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires, c\u2019est le fait d\u2019\u00eatre des repr\u00e9sentants exclusifs \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qui leur permet d\u2019offrir des services de financement hypoth\u00e9caire sans permis de courtage hypoth\u00e9caire. Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que la question est plut\u00f4t de savoir quel r\u00f4le cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment joue dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de subordination.\n[50] En ce qui concerne l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9, dans l\u2019affaire Lamontagne c MRN (2018 CCI 153, para 66), la juge D\u2019Auray a cit\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Dicom Express inc c Paiement (2009 QCCA 611, paras 15-16) dans laquelle la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e comme suit :\nCe qui constitue le trait distinctif entre le contrat de travail et le contrat de service est cette caract\u00e9ristique suivant laquelle l'ex\u00e9cution du travail du salari\u00e9 est subordonn\u00e9e au contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 la direction d'un employeur.\nLe crit\u00e8re de subordination juridique se d\u00e9finit difficilement, mais ne doit surtout pas \u00eatre confondu avec la d\u00e9pendance \u00e9conomique. Le fait de n'\u00eatre li\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un seul client qui impose certains devoirs et obligations au regard de standards de qualit\u00e9 de service, fixe le prix du produit ou dicte certaines normes de publicit\u00e9, ne signifie pas pour autant et n\u00e9cessairement qu'il y a subordination juridique.\n[51] Certes, l\u2019obligation de l\u2019appelante de rendre des services exclusifs \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et aux caisses cr\u00e9ait une d\u00e9pendance \u00e9conomique pour l\u2019appelante. \u00c0 mon avis, cela ne signifie pas pour autant qu\u2019il y a subordination juridique. Le fait que l\u2019appelante doive se limiter \u00e0 la vente des produits Desjardins n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration contr\u00f4lait l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son travail. En outre, je rappelle qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire qui ne d\u00e9tenait pas un permis de courtage, l\u2019appelante n\u2019aurait pas pu vendre des produits de diverses institutions.\nT\u00e9moignage de Mme Eugenia Perrone et Mme France Grandchamp\n[52] Deux des t\u00e9moins convoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante, Mme Eugenia Perrone et Mme France Grandchamp, repr\u00e9sentantes hypoth\u00e9caires aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, ont aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un appel devant cette Cour concernant leur statut de travailleur. Par ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 12 octobre 2021, la Juge Lafleur a refus\u00e9 une demande que leurs appels soient r\u00e9unis et entendus sur preuve commune avec cet appel. Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler, comme l\u2019a fait la Juge Lafleur dans son ordonnance, qu\u2019une analyse factuelle et contextuelle de chaque relation particuli\u00e8re doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer le statut de chaque travailleur. Leur t\u00e9moignage est pertinent seulement dans la mesure o\u00f9 il fait la lumi\u00e8re sur les circonstances propres \u00e0 la relation qu\u2019entretenaient l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\n[53] Mme Grandchamp a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage des autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards. Mme Grandchamp a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire de 2004 \u00e0 2018. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle signait un contrat chaque ann\u00e9e sans quoi elle n\u2019aurait pas de travail. Elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 commission selon la grille des commissions pour les divers produits, sans avantages sociaux. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que lors des r\u00e9unions avec le CDA, on informait les repr\u00e9sentants des nouveaux produits et on affichait un tableau indiquant les r\u00e9sultats des repr\u00e9sentants hypoth\u00e9caires. Mme Grandchamp a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019atteignait pas ses objectifs, ce qui lui est arriv\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la vente d\u2019assurance avec laquelle elle avait plus de difficult\u00e9, elle avait une rencontre avec son CDA. Elle dit que son CDA lui rappelait l\u2019importance d\u2019atteindre ses objectifs et lui offrait des trucs et des strat\u00e9gies pour l\u2019aider. Elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais eu de plan de redressement, ni n\u2019a-t-elle fait l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires. Mme Grandchamp a travaill\u00e9 avec une adjointe qu\u2019elle payait comme travailleuse autonome et selon l\u2019entente convenue entre elles.\n[54] J\u2019ai not\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences importantes entre la situation de Mme Perrone et celle de l\u2019appelante. Par exemple, Mme Perrone travaillait pour les banni\u00e8res, soient des bureaux de courtiers immobiliers tel RE\/MAX, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas de Mme Payette. Plus important encore, Mme Perrone a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire du 20 avril 2017 au 3 octobre 2018, p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pertinente pour l\u2019appelante. Sans passer son t\u00e9moignage en revue en d\u00e9tail, je note qu\u2019elle a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards. En ce qui concerne les points sur lesquels il y avait diff\u00e9rence, sinon divergence, il s\u2019agit de circonstances propres \u00e0 Mme Perrone.\nPosition des parties\n[55] La repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante soutient que Mme Payette \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e parce que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration contr\u00f4lait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e la quantit\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 de son travail. La repr\u00e9sentante de Mme Payette fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments indicateurs du statut d\u2019employ\u00e9, soit l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9, la formation continue offerte par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration et le fait d\u2019afficher les r\u00e9sultats lors des r\u00e9unions avec les CDA. Elle insiste sur le fait que l\u2019appelante ne pouvait pas modifier le contrat qu\u2019elle devait signer chaque ann\u00e9e sans quoi elle n\u2019aurait pas pu continuer dans son r\u00f4le de repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration. La repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante a lu plusieurs clauses du contrat affirmant que celles-ci fournissaient la preuve qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat de louage de services. \u00c0 titre d\u2019illustration, je note quelques exemples. Elle affirme que la clause 3.1 du contrat et la clause 2 du Guide exigent que la repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire rende ses services personnellement. En fait la clause 2 du Guide pr\u00e9voit que le repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire doit en tout temps rencontrer physiquement les clients, et obtenir et v\u00e9rifier les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires. Selon le repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, cette exigence d\u00e9coule de l\u2019obligation de valider l\u2019identit\u00e9 des clients et \u00e9viter des pr\u00eats frauduleux.\n[56] La repr\u00e9sentante soutient que l\u2019obligation de travailler en collaboration avec les caisses comme le pr\u00e9voit la clause 3.8 du contrat ainsi que l\u2019obligation de soumettre les demandes de financement conform\u00e9ment aux directives sont des obligations incompatibles avec le statut de travailleur autonome. Avec respect, je ne vois pas comment le travail fait en collaboration entre le donneur de travail et le travailleur est incompatible avec la nature d\u2019un contrat d\u2019entreprise. Cela est plut\u00f4t une question de d\u00e9pendance \u00e9conomique et il y a toujours une certaine d\u00e9pendance mutuelle entre le payeur et celui qui fournit le travail. Cependant, cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement indicateur de la vraie nature de la relation entre les parties. Selon la repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante, l\u2019obligation de soumettre les demandes conform\u00e9ment aux directives, par exemple, utiliser les formulaires cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration lors de la pr\u00e9paration des dossiers pour fins d\u2019approbation du financement hypoth\u00e9caire (clause 4.2 du Guide) est \u00e9galement indicatrice d\u2019un contrat d\u2019emploi. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une obligation qui permet au repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire de recueillir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019analyse du dossier puisse se faire, et la d\u00e9cision de financement puisse \u00eatre prise en tenant compte des obligations r\u00e8glementaires.\n[57] La repr\u00e9sentante a soutenu, si j\u2019ai bien compris, que le fait que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pouvait ajouter des repr\u00e9sentants dans le secteur de l\u2019appelante indique qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de contr\u00f4le sur le montant des commissions gagn\u00e9es donc elle n\u2019avait pas de chance de profit; selon la repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante, une repr\u00e9sentante hypoth\u00e9caire ne faisait des profits que si la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration voulait que ce soit ainsi. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec cette observation. D\u2019abord, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que tous ses repr\u00e9sentants gagnent le plus grand montant de commissions possible et donc gagne le plus de profit possible. Et l\u2019appelante avait une chance de profit qu\u2019elle contr\u00f4lait en d\u00e9cidant combien de temps et d\u2019effort elle voulait investir dans le d\u00e9marchage de la client\u00e8le. J\u2019ajouterais aussi qu\u2019il me para\u00eet normal que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration puisse choisir d\u2019ajouter des repr\u00e9sentants dans certains secteurs afin d\u2019aller chercher une plus grande part du march\u00e9.\n[58] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions, l\u2019appelante a cit\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision, soit l\u2019affaire F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec c Commission des normes de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail, une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal administratif du travail (2019 QCTAT 4997). Comme indiqu\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, je note que le travailleur dont il \u00e9tait question dans cette affaire \u00e9tait un repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire qui rendait des services \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, mais le contexte de ce litige est bien diff\u00e9rent du contexte de l\u2019affaire devant cette Cour. La question pos\u00e9e au Tribunal administratif du travail fait appel \u00e0 de la l\u00e9gislation qui contient ses propres d\u00e9finitions et qui n\u2019est pas applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En fait, il appert que dans le contexte de la l\u00e9gislation applicable par le tribunal administratif, un repr\u00e9sentant hypoth\u00e9caire peut \u00eatre un employ\u00e9 ou pas selon le fait qu\u2019il emploie ou pas des adjointes. Un tel facteur pris isol\u00e9ment ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9terminant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[59] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration a pass\u00e9 en revue les divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et a soutenu que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration ne contr\u00f4lait pas les moyens d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat et que les parties n\u2019entretenaient pas une relation de subordination tout en rappelant l\u2019importance de l\u2019encadrement l\u00e9gislatif du domaine du financement hypoth\u00e9caire. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a insist\u00e9 lui aussi sur le r\u00e9gime r\u00e9glementaire pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce affirmant que la forte r\u00e8glementation am\u00e8ne des nuances \u00e0 la pond\u00e9ration des facteurs. Il a soutenu qu\u2019une analyse globale des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer pour qualifier la nature juridique de la relation indique une absence de lien de subordination.\nConclusion\n[60] Il convient de rappeler ma conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration avaient une intention commune de conclure un contrat de service. Une fois cette \u00e9tape franchie, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective confirme cette intention. Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler l\u2019obligation de cette Cour d\u2019examiner la relation globale qu\u2019entretenaient les parties au contrat et de d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective confirme l\u2019intention des parties. Prises isol\u00e9ment, certaines clauses du contrat et du Guide pourraient sembler indiquer que les parties ont sign\u00e9 un contrat de louage de services.\n[61] Il est important de reconnaitre le contexte fort r\u00e8glement\u00e9 dans lequel se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les faits de cette affaire. La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration avait une obligation de s\u2019assurer du respect des abondantes exigences statutaires et r\u00e8glementaires, ainsi que les lignes directrices de l\u2019AMF et du BSIF. Cela apporte une nuance \u00e0 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Par exemple, l\u2019obligation de rencontrer physiquement les clients, l\u2019obligation d\u2019utiliser certains formulaires afin de recueillir les renseignements pertinents ainsi que l\u2019obligation d\u2019approbation du choix des adjointes sont tous des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui refl\u00e8tent ces obligations et qui, \u00e0 mon avis, ne t\u00e9moignent pas d\u2019un contr\u00f4le du travailleur par le payeur.\n[62] Nombreux sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments, qui, examin\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on globale militent en faveur d\u2019une absence de lien de subordination. Par exemple, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante travaillait \u00e0 partir de sa voiture ou de son domicile, d\u00e9terminait son horaire de travail et choisissait quand prendre ses vacances, n\u2019avait pas de vacances pay\u00e9es ni ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait-elle d\u2019autres avantages sociaux, assumait les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es pour gagner ses commissions et les d\u00e9duisait dans le calcul de son revenu qu\u2019elle d\u00e9clarait \u00e0 titre de revenu d\u2019entreprise, avait un risque de perte, mais surtout une chance de faire des profits en augmentant son volume de ventes et pouvait retenir les services d\u2019une adjointe.\n[63] Il est vrai que lors des r\u00e9unions, la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration discutait des objectifs et des r\u00e9sultats de ventes et aussi, \u00e0 partir de sondages, elle \u00e9valuait la qualit\u00e9 des services re\u00e7us par les clients. Selon le repr\u00e9sentant de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, si le traitement des clients est insatisfaisant, il est normal que la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration intervienne; si les services sont de mauvaise qualit\u00e9, il est normal qu\u2019un payeur intervienne et \u00e0 la limite qu\u2019il r\u00e9silie le contrat si le service achet\u00e9 est inad\u00e9quat.\n[64] \u00c0 ce sujet, je rappelle les propos de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui nous invite \u00e0 la prudence dans l\u2019affaire Le Livreur Plus inc c Canada (MRN) (2004 CAF 68 au para 19) en affirmant qu\u2019il ne faut pas \u00ab confondre le contr\u00f4le du r\u00e9sultat ou de la qualit\u00e9 des travaux avec le contr\u00f4le de leur ex\u00e9cution par l\u2019ouvrier charg\u00e9 de les r\u00e9aliser \u00bb. La Cour continue en ajoutant que \u00ab rares sont les donneurs d\u2019ouvrage qui ne s\u2019assurent pas que le travail est ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 avec leurs exigences \u00bb. Bref, cet indice indique un contr\u00f4le du r\u00e9sultat qui n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas au contr\u00f4le de la travailleuse.\n[65] Ayant examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des facteurs pertinents, aucun de ceux-ci n\u2019\u00e9tant \u00e0 lui seul d\u00e9terminant, je conclus que l\u2019appelante et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration sont li\u00e9es par un contrat de service et que l\u2019appelante n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration au sens de la LAE.\n[66] Pour tous ces motifs, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9, sans frais, et la d\u00e9cision de la Ministre dat\u00e9e du 4 mai 2018 selon laquelle l\u2019appelante n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) de la LAE pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente est confirm\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 20e jour de janvier 2023.\n\u00ab Gabrielle St-Hilaire \u00bb\nJuge St-Hilaire\nANNEXE A\nDispositions du Code Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, RLRQ c CCQ-1991\n1425.

Le contrat de travail est celui par lequel une personne, le salari\u00e9, s\u2019oblige, pour un temps limit\u00e9 et moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, \u00e0 effectuer un travail sous la direction ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019une autre personne, l\u2019employeur.\n2086. Le contrat de travail est \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n2098. Le contrat d\u2019entreprise ou de service est celui par lequel une personne, selon le cas l\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services, s\u2019engage envers une autre personne, le client, \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un ouvrage mat\u00e9riel ou intellectuel ou \u00e0 fournir un service moyennant un prix que le client s\u2019oblige \u00e0 lui payer.\n2099. L\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services a le libre choix des moyens d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat et il n\u2019existe entre lui et le client aucun lien de subordination quant \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution.\n1425. The common intention of the parties rather than adherence to the literal meaning of the words shall be sought in interpreting a contract.\n1426. In interpreting a contract, the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, the interpretation which has already been given to it by the parties or which it may have received, and usage, are all taken into account.\n2085. A contract of employment is a contract by which a person, the employee, undertakes, for a limited time and for remuneration, to do work under the direction or control of another person, the employer.\n2086. A contract of employment is for a fixed term or an indeterminate term.\n2098. A contract of enterprise or for services is a contract by which a person, the contractor or the provider of services, as the case may be, undertakes to another person, the client, to carry out physical or intellectual work or to supply a service, for a price which the client binds himself to pay to him.\n2099. The contractor or the provider of services is free to choose the means of performing the contract and, with respect to such performance, no relationship of subordination exists between the contractor or the provider of services and the client.\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 9\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2018-1773(EI)\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nSOPHIE PAYETTE ET LE MINISTRE DU REVENU NATIONAL ET F\u00c9D\u00c9RATION DES CAISSES DESJARDINS DU QU\u00c9BEC\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATES DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLes 24 et 25 ao\u00fbt et le 3 novembre 2022\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Gabrielle St-Hilaire\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 20 janvier 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nRepr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelante :\nMercedes Diaz\nAvocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe Julien Dub\u00e9-Sen\u00e9cal\nAvocat de l\u2019intervenante :\nMe Simon-Pierre H\u00e9bert\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019intervenante :\nMe Simon-Pierre H\u00e9bert\nCabinet :\nBCF S.E.N.C.R.L.\nComplexe Jules-Dallaire, T1 2828, boul.

Introduction\n[1] M. Georges Boisselle est un homme d\u2019affaires qui a travaill\u00e9 comme courtier immobilier pendant une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. En 1997, fort de cette exp\u00e9rience et voulant changer de carri\u00e8re, il est devenu courtier en assurance et \u0153uvre dans ce domaine depuis environ 25 ans. Au fil des ans, il a achet\u00e9, r\u00e9nov\u00e9 et vendu plusieurs immeubles. Il en a gard\u00e9 quelques-uns, ceux-ci \u00e9tant destin\u00e9s \u00e0 la location.\n[2] M. Boisselle exploite son entreprise de courtage en assurance par l\u2019entremise de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 AssurExperts Boisselle & Associ\u00e9s Inc. (AssurExperts) dont lui et ses enfants, Laurent Boisselle et Marie-\u00c8ve Boisselle, sont actionnaires.\n[3] En 2011, M. Boisselle a achet\u00e9 un immeuble \u00e0 Varennes, lequel fut converti en copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 divise destin\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins commerciales et r\u00e9sidentielles. Il a vendu des unit\u00e9s de cette copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants Laurent et Marie-\u00c8ve ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 9287-4775 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (9287). M. Boisselle, Laurent et Marie-\u00c8ve sont les actionnaires de 9287, laquelle fut constitu\u00e9e en 2013. AssurExperts exploite ses activit\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d\u2019un local lou\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 9287.\n[4] M. Boisselle a fait l\u2019objet de nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par la ministre du Revenu national (Ministre) en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, LRC (1985), c 1 (5e supp) (Loi) pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017. La Ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019un montant de 321 088 $ \u00e0 titre de perte finale pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013, ajustement qui eut des r\u00e9percussions sur les autres ann\u00e9es en litige. Pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013, 2014 et 2015, la Ministre a inclus les montants de 10 136 $, 5 292 $ et 7 742 $ dans le calcul du revenu de M. Boisselle \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire.\n[5] 9287 a acquis une des unit\u00e9s de l\u2019immeuble ainsi que le garage pour un montant de 511 000 $. Dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenu pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant le 30 avril 2015, 2016 et 2017 (les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015, 2016 et 2017), 9287 a d\u00e9duit un montant \u00e0 titre d\u2019allocation du co\u00fbt en capital, lequel fut calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la fraction non amortie du co\u00fbt en capital (FNACC) fond\u00e9e sur un co\u00fbt en capital de 511 000 $ pour l\u2019immeuble. Ayant conclu que le montant de 511 000 $ ne repr\u00e9sente pas la juste valeur marchande (JVM) de l\u2019unit\u00e9 et du garage achet\u00e9s par 9287, la Ministre a fait des ajustements \u00e0 la FNACC. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Ministre a \u00e9tabli de nouvelles cotisations en vertu de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015, 2016 et 2017 afin de r\u00e9duire le montant d\u00e9ductible \u00e0 titre d\u2019allocation du co\u00fbt en capital.\nII. Contexte\n[6] AssurExperts est une entreprise familiale dans laquelle travaillent M. Boisselle, Marie-\u00c8ve, Laurent et sa conjointe (M\u00e9lanie), et 3 autres employ\u00e9s. En 2011, AssurExperts \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de nouveaux locaux puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en croissance et les locaux qu\u2019elle louait de M. Boisselle pour mener ses activit\u00e9s \u00e9taient devenus trop petits.\n[7] En 2011, M. Boisselle a re\u00e7u par la poste une annonce publicisant la vente d\u2019un immeuble situ\u00e9 au 68, rue Ste-Anne \u00e0 Varennes (l\u2019immeuble). C\u2019est un immeuble qu\u2019il connaissait et il consid\u00e9rait que le prix \u00e9tait raisonnable; il y voyait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019installer les bureaux d\u2019AssurExperts dans une partie de l\u2019immeuble.\n[8] En ao\u00fbt 2011, M. Boisselle, Laurent, M\u00e9lanie et Marie-\u00c8ve visitent l\u2019immeuble. Laurent a affirm\u00e9 que ce fut \u00ab le coup de foudre \u00bb et que tout de suite apr\u00e8s la visite alors qu\u2019ils fussent dans la voiture, il a dit \u00e0 son p\u00e8re qu\u2019il souhaitait y vivre avec sa famille. M. Boisselle a affirm\u00e9 que, comme lui, son fils \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 en amour avec l\u2019immeuble et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 changer les plans dans sa t\u00eate pour en faire un syndicat de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour qu\u2019ils puissent tous y demeurer, soit M. Boisselle, Laurent, Marie-\u00c8ve et leurs familles respectives (Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 151-152).\n[9] Par acte notari\u00e9 le 31 ao\u00fbt 2011, M. Boisselle a achet\u00e9 l\u2019immeuble pour un montant de 500 000 $. La d\u00e9claration de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 divise fut notari\u00e9e le 6 ao\u00fbt 2013. Par actes notari\u00e9s le 23 octobre 2013, M. Boisselle a vendu trois des quatre unit\u00e9s de l\u2019immeuble ainsi que le garage.\n[10] Dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 une perte finale totale de 412 813 $ se r\u00e9partissant comme suit :\nPerte finale de 91 725 $ sur l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et le garage vendus \u00e0 9287;\nPerte finale de 113 467 $ sur l\u2019unit\u00e9 201 vendue \u00e0 Marie-\u00c8ve;\nPerte finale de 207 621 $ sur l\u2019unit\u00e9 301 vendue \u00e0 Laurent et M\u00e9lanie.\n[11] La Ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019un montant de 321 088 $ \u00e0 titre de perte finale relativement aux unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 vendues aux enfants de l\u2019appelant.\n[12] De plus, pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013, 2014 et 2015, la Ministre a inclus des avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire dans le revenu de M. Boisselle pour des montants que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 AssurExperts a pay\u00e9s pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des membres de sa famille. Les montants inclus sont constitu\u00e9s essentiellement de frais de subsistance, de frais de voyage et de d\u00e9penses pour des activit\u00e9s sportives.\nIII. Questions en litige\n[13] Les deux appels, soient l\u2019appel de M. Boisselle et celui de 9287, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus ensemble sur preuve commune. Cela dit, bien que la vente de l\u2019immeuble soit au c\u0153ur des deux dossiers, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 leurs diff\u00e9rences, il convient d\u2019identifier les questions en litige dans chacun des dossiers de fa\u00e7on distincte. Aussi, je ferai l\u2019analyse et je tirerai des conclusions sur chacun des appels s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\nQuestions en litige dans l\u2019appel de 9287\n[14] Dans l\u2019appel de 9287, la Cour est saisie des questions suivantes :\nEn ce qui concerne l\u2019achat de l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et du garage, la question primordiale est celle de savoir si la Ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de diminuer le montant que 9287 pouvait d\u00e9duire \u00e0 titre d\u2019allocation du co\u00fbt en capital (ACC) pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015, 2016 et 2017. Dans les circonstances de cet appel, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, la Cour devra d\u00e9terminer la JVM de l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et du garage; et\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la position prise par l\u2019appelante, soit que les ann\u00e9es 2015, 2016 et 2017 sont frapp\u00e9es de prescription m\u00eame si les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 152(3.1) de la Loi, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la Ministre a \u00e9tabli les cotisations contest\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9lais autoris\u00e9s par la Loi.\nQuestions en litige dans l\u2019appel de M. Boisselle\n[15] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 que les montants inclus dans le revenu de M. Boisselle \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013, 2014 et 2015 ne faisaient pas l\u2019objet de contestation sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013 pourrait \u00eatre frapp\u00e9e de prescription (Transcription, volume 1 \u00e0 la p 25).\n[16] Dans ces circonstances, la Cour est saisie des questions suivantes dans l\u2019appel de M. Boisselle :\nEst-ce que la Ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013? et\nEst-ce que l\u2019appelant est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9duire une perte finale pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 vendues \u00e0 ses enfants?\nIV. Droit et analyse\nA. Appel de 9287\n[17] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si la Ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de r\u00e9duire le montant d\u00e9ductible \u00e0 titre d\u2019ACC, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer la JVM de l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et du garage achet\u00e9s par 9287. Il convient de rappeler que le calcul de l\u2019ACC d\u00e9pend de la FNACC et qu\u2019en revanche celle-ci d\u00e9pend en partie du co\u00fbt en capital du bien amortissable. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 69, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le lien de d\u00e9pendance entre 9287 et M. Boisselle, le co\u00fbt en capital est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre \u00e9gal \u00e0 la JVM du bien.\n[18] Comme affirm\u00e9 dans son avis d\u2019appel et comme discut\u00e9 au d\u00e9but du proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelante a obtenu un rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019immeuble. Pour des raisons qui lui sont propres, l\u2019appelante a choisi de ne pas faire t\u00e9moigner l\u2019auteur de ce rapport. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul rapport d\u2019expert devant la Cour, celui obtenu par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre de ce litige (I-2, onglet 9).\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a confi\u00e9 le mandat d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 \u00c9ric Gaudreau, \u00e9valuateur agr\u00e9\u00e9 par l\u2019Institut canadien des \u00e9valuateurs (Institut) et chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada. La Cour a qualifi\u00e9 M. Gaudreau comme t\u00e9moin expert ind\u00e9pendant quant aux \u00e9valuations de biens immobiliers. Je note que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 reconna\u00eetre l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Gaudreau en tant qu\u2019expert.\n[20] J\u2019estime que M. Gaudreau est un t\u00e9moin professionnel, honn\u00eate et cr\u00e9dible; son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait franc, direct et coh\u00e9rent. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que parmi les trois m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9valuation reconnues, soit la m\u00e9thode du co\u00fbt, la m\u00e9thode du revenu et la m\u00e9thode de comparaison, cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait la mieux adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019un logement individuel en copropri\u00e9t\u00e9. M. Gaudreau a expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail son approche \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019immeuble, identifiant les documents consult\u00e9s, et d\u00e9crivant les photos prises, les pistes cyclables environnantes et la vue de l\u2019immeuble. En appliquant la m\u00e9thode de comparaison, il a choisi des comparables r\u00e9sidentiels. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir pourquoi il avait compar\u00e9 l\u2019unit\u00e9 101, utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins commerciales, \u00e0 des unit\u00e9s utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 des fins r\u00e9sidentielles, M. Gaudreau a affirm\u00e9 que les r\u00e8gles applicables l\u2019obligeaient \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019immeuble en choisissant l\u2019utilisation optimale de l\u2019immeuble, soit l\u2019usage \u00ab qui conf\u00e8re au bien immobilier la meilleure valeur marchande \u00bb selon la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019Institut. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019utilisation r\u00e9sidentielle \u00e9tait celle \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier. \u00c0 la valeur \u00e9tablie en fonction de l\u2019utilisation optimale, il a fait les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires, en tenant compte des co\u00fbts de conversion de l\u2019unit\u00e9 commerciale \u00e0 une unit\u00e9 de type r\u00e9sidentielle. En contre-interrogatoire, il a ajout\u00e9 que d\u2019en faire l\u2019\u00e9valuation en fonction de son usage commercial \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une faute professionnelle (Transcription, volume 2 \u00e0 la p 63).\n[21] En appliquant la m\u00e9thode de la comparaison \u00e0 des comparables r\u00e9sidentiels et en tenant compte des caract\u00e9ristiques de l\u2019immeuble (pas d\u2019ouverture sur les c\u00f4t\u00e9s, un bureau \u00e0 aire ouverte, hauteur de 8 pieds, une cuisinette et non une cuisine compl\u00e8te, l\u2019absence de salle de bain compl\u00e8te, etc.), M. Gaudreau a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la valeur de l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 s\u2019\u00e9tablissait \u00e0 140 000 $, et \u00e0 170 000 $ avec le garage, taxes non comprises.\n[22] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante a soulev\u00e9 des questions concernant la diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9tablie par M. Gaudreau et l\u2019\u00e9valuation municipale. M. Gaudreau a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9valuation municipale contenait des erreurs, y compris quant au nombre de pieds carr\u00e9s ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages alors que l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et le garage se trouvent sur un seul \u00e9tage.\n[23] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage professionnel et cr\u00e9dible de M. Gaudreau et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019expertise \u00e0 la Cour \u00e9tablissant une diff\u00e9rente JVM, je conclus que la JVM de l\u2019immeuble pour les fins du calcul de la FNACC et de l\u2019ACC est de 170 000 $ pour l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et le garage. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cette JVM \u00e9quivaut au CC de l\u2019immeuble et il s\u2019agit du montant utilis\u00e9 par la Ministre pour calculer l\u2019ACC d\u00e9ductible par l\u2019appelante pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015, 2016 et 2017 en tenant compte de l\u2019ACC r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en 2014 et de la valeur du terrain (voir le para 19m) de la R\u00e9ponse). Outre son d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la JVM et au CC, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ces calculs.\n[24] En plus de contester la JVM de l\u2019immeuble, l\u2019appelante soutient que la Ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier l\u2019ACC pour les ann\u00e9es 2015, 2016 et 2017. Si j\u2019ai bien compris la position de l\u2019appelante, la Ministre ne peut \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour ces ann\u00e9es pour recalculer l\u2019ACC d\u00e9ductible, car cette valeur d\u00e9pend du CC de l\u2019immeuble (et donc de sa JVM), valeur fix\u00e9e en 2013 au moment de l\u2019acquisition de l\u2019immeuble. Et, puisque l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013 est prescrite, le sont aussi les ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes. Je n\u2019accepte pas cet argument.\n[25] Le paragraphe 152(3.1) de la Loi autorise la Ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation trois ans suivant la date d\u2019envoi d\u2019un avis de premi\u00e8re cotisation. Contrairement au paragraphe 152(4), le paragraphe 152(3.1) ne contient pas de conditions \u00e0 rencontrer, sans quoi la Ministre ne serait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. La Ministre a l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir une cotisation conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi et je ne vois rien dans la Loi qui l\u2019emp\u00eache de corriger une erreur contenue dans une cotisation pour une ann\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieure qui est frapp\u00e9e de prescription lorsque l\u2019ann\u00e9e subs\u00e9quente, faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation, n\u2019est pas frapp\u00e9e de prescription.\n[26] Cette position est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Atlantic Thermal Star Limited, 2016 CCI 135, et je fais miens les propos de la Juge Lafleur qui s\u2019exprimait comme suit aux paragraphes 38-39 :\n[38] \u00c0 mon avis, rien ne permet d\u2019emp\u00eacher soit le ministre, soit une autre partie, de faire des all\u00e9gations factuelles sur l\u2019\u00e9tat des choses remontant \u00e0 une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition ant\u00e9rieure lorsque ces all\u00e9gations, si elles s\u2019av\u00e8rent, ont des r\u00e9percussions sur l\u2019exactitude de la cotisation (ou, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019avis de d\u00e9termination des pertes) en litige devant la Cour.\n[39] Je mentionne ici le principe, que certaines d\u00e9cisions ont appel\u00e9 \u00ab le principe du jugement New St. James \u00bb (voir, par exemple, le jugement Sherway Centre Limited c. La Reine, 2001 DTC 1021, [2001] ACI no 751 (QL) (CCI)) : rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le ministre de contester certains montants \u00e9tablis durant une ann\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieure pour en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion sur la position du contribuable lors d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition donn\u00e9e. Comme le soutenait le juge en chef Bowman (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre), dans sa discussion sur le principe du jugement New St. James (Coastal Construction & Excavating Ltd. v R, 1996 CanLII 21537 (TCC), [1996] 3 CTC 2845, au paragraphe 23, 97 DTC 26 (TCC), qui cite le jugement New St. James Limited v M.N.R., 1966 CanLII 947 (CA EXC), [1966] CTC 305, 66 DTC 5241 (C. de l\u2019\u00c9.) :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEnfin, l\u2019appelant soutient que comme le ministre avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9, dans les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, l\u2019exploitation comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab \u00e9tablissement \u00bb au sens de la Loi sur les subventions au d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9gional (LSDR), il n\u2019avait pas le droit de modifier le report en avant du cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019investissement \u00e0 partir des ann\u00e9es frapp\u00e9es de prescription pour modifier le revenu imposable d\u2019une ann\u00e9e non frapp\u00e9e de prescription afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir que son bien \u00e9tait admissible et non certifi\u00e9. Cette interpr\u00e9tation impliquerait que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du solde du report pour les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019investissement lors d\u2019une ann\u00e9e frapp\u00e9e de prescription \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation. Je ne consid\u00e8re pas que l\u2019article 152 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu puisse admettre une telle conclusion. Le ministre a l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir une cotisation en conformit\u00e9 avec les r\u00e8gles de droit en vigueur. Si la cotisation \u00e9tablie lors d\u2019une ann\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieure est inexacte et que cette ann\u00e9e-\u00adl\u00e0 est devenue frapp\u00e9e de prescription, il sera impossible de modifier la cotisation de cette ann\u00e9e-\u00adl\u00e0, mais ce fait n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de corriger l\u2019erreur dans une autre ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui, elle, n\u2019est pas frapp\u00e9e de prescription, m\u00eame s\u2019il faut apporter une correction aux reports des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, pouvant \u00eatre une perte ou un solde en cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019investissement.

Aucune question d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e : Goldstein c. La Reine, 96 D.T.C. 1029.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nLe juge L\u00e9tourneau a cit\u00e9 ces commentaires qu\u2019il a faits siens dans son jugement Canada c. Papiers Cascades Cabano inc., 2006 CAF 419, au paragraphe 23, 2008 DTC 6264.\n[27] Suite \u00e0 une discussion avec les parties, la Cour a conclu que les nouvelles cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es 2015, 2016 et 2017 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation (Transcription, volume 2 aux pp 5-16). Dans ces circonstances, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ma conclusion concernant la JVM de l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et du garage, je conclus que la Ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations en modifiant le montant de l\u2019ACC d\u00e9ductible pour les ann\u00e9es en litige. L\u2019appel des cotisations de 9287 \u00e9tablies pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant le 30 avril 2015, 2016 et 2017 est rejet\u00e9.\nB. Appel de Georges Boisselle\nNouvelle cotisation \u00e9tablie au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013\n[28] En traitant de la premi\u00e8re question en litige dans l\u2019appel de M. Boisselle, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la Ministre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013.\n[29] Le paragraphe 152(4) de la Loi autorise la Ministre, dans certaines circonstances, \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Les parties pertinentes se lisent comme suit :\n152 (4) Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie ou donner avis par \u00e9crit qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 toute personne qui a produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants : a) le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration : (i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi, (ii) soit a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre une renonciation, selon le formulaire prescrit, au cours de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e;\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[30] L\u2019appelant soutient que la Ministre n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 puisqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. En revanche, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la Ministre \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir cette nouvelle cotisation en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la Loi pour deux motifs : i) premi\u00e8rement, parce que l\u2019appelant a sign\u00e9 une renonciation conform\u00e9ment au sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(ii) et deuxi\u00e8mement, parce que l\u2019appelant a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire conform\u00e9ment au sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i). En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019appelant affirme que la renonciation n\u2019est pas valide et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait de faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\n[31] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 fut \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Le 28 mars 2017, l\u2019appelant a sign\u00e9 le formulaire T2029 intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019application de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation ou de la p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e de nouvelle cotisation \u00bb pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 7). Le formulaire prescrit pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab pour qu\u2019une renonciation soit valide, le ou les points qui font l\u2019objet de la renonciation doivent \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019espace pr\u00e9vu \u00bb. Dans l\u2019espace r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, l\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de :\nL\u2019imp\u00f4t r\u00e9sultant des changements aux :\n- Revenus locatifs\n- Gains en capital\n- Dividendes r\u00e9put\u00e9s\n[32] L\u2019appelant soutient que puisque la perte finale n\u2019y est pas mentionn\u00e9e, la renonciation, bien qu\u2019autrement valide, ne peut pas s\u2019appliquer pour autoriser la Ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation relativement \u00e0 la perte finale r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la renonciation fut sign\u00e9e en mars 2017, car la date de prescription approchait, et sans la renonciation, la Ministre aurait \u00e9tabli une cotisation avant la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le v\u00e9rificateur, M. Minoungou, a affirm\u00e9 que lorsque la renonciation fut sign\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait au d\u00e9but de la v\u00e9rification et il avait fait de son mieux pour \u00e9tablir la liste des \u00e9l\u00e9ments vis\u00e9s par la renonciation. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que m\u00eame si la renonciation ne mentionnait que les dividendes, elle serait tout de m\u00eame valide et rien n\u2019emp\u00eache que d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments fassent l\u2019objet de la nouvelle cotisation. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. Avec \u00e9gard, je ne vois pas la pertinence de demander au contribuable de pr\u00e9ciser les points qui font l\u2019objet de la renonciation pour ensuite en faire fie.\n[33] Dans l\u2019affaire R c Honeywell Limited, 2007 CAF 22, aux paragraphes 32 et 35, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 que la Ministre peut s\u2019appuyer sur une renonciation pour \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation mais exclusivement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans la renonciation. La Cour s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e comme suit :\n[32] La renonciation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le contribuable et accept\u00e9e par le ministre donne lieu \u00e0 un compromis. Le contribuable renonce \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de la p\u00e9riode normale de cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e particuli\u00e8re vis\u00e9e par la question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la renonciation et le ministre, en s\u2019appuyant sur la renonciation, acquiert le droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de cotisation, mais exclusivement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la renonciation. Tout comme le contribuable ne peut modifier la renonciation qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, le ministre ne peut \u00e9tablir de nouvelle cotisation qui ne soit pas raisonnablement reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la renonciation. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge en chef Bowman, la formulation du sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 152(4.01)a)(ii) \u00e9tablit clairement que lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019appuie sur une renonciation, le ministre ne peut \u00e9tablir de nouvelle cotisation \u00ab que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer qu[e la nouvelle cotisation] se rapporte \u00e0 [\u2026] une question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans une renonciation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e [\u2026] \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans le cas o\u00f9 est \u00e9tablie une nouvelle cotisation appuy\u00e9e sur une renonciation, la mention \u00ab nouvelle cotisation \u00bb du paragraphe 152(4) ne peut s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter que comme une nouvelle cotisation permise par la renonciation.\n[\u2026]\n[35] En fin de compte, le juge en chef Bowman a conclu, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux termes du paragraphe 152(4.01), que l\u2019inclusion propos\u00e9e du REATB dans le revenu d\u2019Honeywell n\u2019est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment dont il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il se rapporte \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la renonciation. Il \u00e9tait loisible au juge en chef Bowman de tirer cette conclusion \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier dont il \u00e9tait saisi et j\u2019estime pour ma part que la conclusion est correcte.\n[Je souligne]\n[34] Voir aussi les propos du juge Miller dans l\u2019affaire Loblaws Financial Holdings Inc c R, 2018 CCI 182, aux paras 280-285, inf 2020 CAF 79, conf 2021 CSC 51.\n[35] Or, la Ministre peut \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019elle se rapporte \u00e0 une question pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e dans la renonciation. \u00c0 mon avis, la question plus difficile est celle de savoir si un certain \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui n\u2019est pas explicitement mentionn\u00e9 peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme vis\u00e9 par un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui, lui, est explicitement inclus dans la renonciation. Dans l\u2019affaire Mitchell c R, 2002 CAF 407, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Solberg c R, 92 DTC 6448 (CF, 1re inst), une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale maintes fois cit\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mitchell, au paragraphe 37, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e comme suit :\nL\u2019approche qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la renonciation consiste \u00e0 chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention des parties telle qu\u2019elle est exprim\u00e9e dans ce document ainsi que par les circonstances pertinentes pour lesquelles il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[36] Aussi, dans l\u2019affaire Solberg, supra, la juge Reed a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de faire la preuve de la port\u00e9e de la renonciation et en outre, que toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solue en faveur du contribuable (\u00e0 cet effet, voir aussi l\u2019affaire Qu\u00e9bec (Sous-ministre du Revenu) c Strulovich, 2007 QCCA 195, cit\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant).\n[37] Selon l\u2019appelant, les trois points mentionn\u00e9s dans la renonciation ne visent pas la perte finale. Je suis d\u2019accord. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve pouvant permettre de conclure que le perte finale est vis\u00e9e par les questions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans le formulaire de renonciation. Dans ces circonstances, la Ministre ne peut s\u2019appuyer sur la renonciation pour \u00e9tablir la nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la perte finale r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant.\n[38] Cela dit, la Cour doit maintenant consid\u00e9rer l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en faisant abstraction de la renonciation, le v\u00e9rificateur a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la question de savoir si la Ministre pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour le motif que l\u2019appelant a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire.\n[39] Le fardeau de preuve incombe \u00e0 la Ministre d\u2019\u00e9tablir d\u2019une part, que le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, et d\u2019autre part, que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire ou en commettant la fraude (voir Vine c R, 2015 CAF 125 aux paras 23-34). Le libell\u00e9 du texte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) de la Loi est tel qu\u2019il est suffisant pour la Ministre d\u2019\u00e9tablir la n\u00e9gligence ou l\u2019inattention sans devoir examiner la question de savoir si le contribuable a commis une fraude (voir Deyab c Canada, 2020 CAF 222 aux paras 58-61).\n[40] Il est de jurisprudence constante que le seuil pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y eut une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits est bas. Cette position est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les propos du juge Bocock dans l\u2019affaire Francis & Associates c R, 2014 CCI 137 au paragraphe 20 :\nUne pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e de faits s\u2019entend de n\u2019importe quelle d\u00e9claration \u00ab inexacte \u00bb : MNR v. Foot, 1964 CanLII 1088 (CA EXC), [1964] C.T.C. 317 (CSC). Par ailleurs, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions que \u00ab toute \u00bb erreur commise dans une d\u00e9claration produite est assimilable \u00e0 une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits : MNR v. Taylor, 1961 CanLII 719 (CA EXC), [1961] C.T.C. 211 (C. de l\u2019\u00c9.), Nesbitt c. la Reine, 1996 (CAF) et Ridge Run Developments Inc. v. R, 2007 CCI 68 (CanLII), [2007] 3 C.T.C. 2605 (CCI). C\u2019est donc dire que le crit\u00e8re qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits n\u2019est pas strict.\n[Je souligne]\n[41] Dans son rapport de v\u00e9rification ainsi que dans son rapport intitul\u00e9 \u00ab recommandation d\u2019ouvrir une ann\u00e9e prescrite \u00bb, M. Minoungou a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des faits erron\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la perte finale indument r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, aux avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire pour les d\u00e9penses personnelles pay\u00e9es par AssurExperts ainsi qu\u2019a la d\u00e9claration du revenu locatif (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglets 5 et 6). En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des questions pos\u00e9es au moment de la v\u00e9rification relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de revenu locatif, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7u de loyer (Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 240-242 et 280). Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Laurent a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne payait pas de loyer pour l\u2019unit\u00e9 301 pendant la p\u00e9riode entre l\u2019emm\u00e9nagement en mai 2012 et l\u2019achat notari\u00e9 en octobre 2013 bien qu\u2019il payait les d\u00e9penses reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019unit\u00e9 (Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 110-111). Je vais m\u2019abstenir de sp\u00e9culer sur la raison pouvant avoir motiv\u00e9 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer du revenu de location re\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019immeuble alors que personne n\u2019en payait. Je note que l\u2019appelant a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ne pas avoir produit en preuve le formulaire T776 lequel fait \u00e9tat des loyers. Toutefois, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve pour contredire le t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible du v\u00e9rificateur relativement au revenu locatif.\n[42] Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 que M. Boisselle ne conteste pas l\u2019inclusion des avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi. Selon le rapport de v\u00e9rification ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Minoungou, les montants inclus dans le calcul du revenu de M. Boisselle \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire sont constitu\u00e9s de d\u00e9penses personnelles pay\u00e9es par AssurExperts telles les suivantes : frais de subsistance, billets d\u2019activit\u00e9s sportives tels les tournois de tennis et des parties de hockey, frais de voyages, par exemple \u00e0 Cuba et au Mexique, et des sorties au cin\u00e9ma et au spa (Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 5). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les repr\u00e9sentations de l\u2019appelant, le v\u00e9rificateur a tenu compte du fait que certaines d\u00e9penses avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es pour des activit\u00e9s offertes \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des employ\u00e9s. Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9penses personnelles pour les avantages conf\u00e9r\u00e9s seulement aux personnes li\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Boisselle, les montants furent inclus dans son revenu \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantages \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire.\n[43] Sans m\u00eame toucher \u00e0 la question de la perte finale, il ne fait nul doute que M. Boisselle a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits en produisant sa d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant des renseignements sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des revenus locatifs non pay\u00e9s par 9287 et ses enfants relativement \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble ainsi qu\u2019en fournissant des renseignements permettant \u00e0 AssurExperts de d\u00e9duire des d\u00e9penses personnelles non autoris\u00e9es par la Loi.\n[44] La Ministre doit aussi \u00e9tablir que l\u2019appelant a fait cette pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire. Dans les circonstances, il suffit que la Ministre rencontre le crit\u00e8re minimal de manque de diligence raisonnable (voir Venne c R, [1984] FCJ No 314 (CF, 1re inst)). Dans l\u2019affaire Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd c R, [1991] 1 CTC 29, au para 7, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu qu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que le degr\u00e9 de soin exig\u00e9 est celui de la personne sage et prudente. Pour reprendre les mots du Juge Muldoon dans l\u2019affaire Reilly c R, [1984] CTC 21 (CF, 1re inst) au para 51, la sagesse n\u2019est pas infaillible et la prudence n\u2019est pas la perfection. Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a fourni aucune explication \u00e0 la Cour pour sa pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits. Son comportement ne refl\u00e8te pas celui d\u2019une personne faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable. \u00c0 titre d\u2019homme d\u2019affaires ayant acquis des d\u00e9cennies d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le secteur de l\u2019immobilier et de l\u2019assurance, il n\u2019a pas agi de fa\u00e7on sage et prudente. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve permettant \u00e0 la Cour de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019est pos\u00e9 des questions, qu\u2019il a pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 son comptable ou \u00e0 son fiscaliste concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui constituent une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits. Son comptable, M. Alain Girard, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il compl\u00e9tait les d\u00e9clarations de revenu de M. Boisselle ainsi que celle de 9287 et d\u2019AssurExperts \u00e0 partir de l\u2019information que lui transmettait M. Boisselle. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple seulement, l\u2019appelant devait savoir que, dans les circonstances, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 AssurExperts ne pouvait pas d\u00e9duire les montants pay\u00e9s pour un voyage \u00e0 Cuba fait par les personnes qui lui sont li\u00e9es. Je conclus que l\u2019appelant a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits et que ce fut par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire. La Ministre s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau qui lui incombe et elle peut \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013.\nLa perte finale d\u00e9duite en 2013\n[45] La deuxi\u00e8me question en litige dans l\u2019appel de M. Boisselle se rapporte \u00e0 la perte finale d\u00e9duite en 2013. Comme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, la Ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019un montant de 321 088 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de perte finale relativement aux unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 vendues aux enfants de l\u2019appelant.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 sont des biens \u00e0 usage personnel tels que d\u00e9finis \u00e0 l\u2019article 54 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la perte encourue suite \u00e0 leur disposition est r\u00e9put\u00e9e nulle conform\u00e9ment au sous-alin\u00e9a 40(2)g)(iii) de la Loi. Dans ces circonstances, la disposition de ces deux unit\u00e9s ne donne pas lieu \u00e0 une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 titre de perte finale autoris\u00e9e par le paragraphe 20(16).\n[47] L\u2019appelant soutient que les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 ne sont pas des biens \u00e0 usage personnel. Selon l\u2019appelant, il a dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble en mai 2012 lorsque Marie-\u00c8ve ainsi que Laurent et M\u00e9lanie ont d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans leurs unit\u00e9s respectives et non en octobre 2013, date des actes de ventes notari\u00e9es (Avis d\u2019appel au para 56). Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que, lors de ses observations devant la Cour, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a parfois sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la disposition de l\u2019immeuble pourrait m\u00eame \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avoir eu lieu en 2011 (Transcription, volume 2 aux pp 133-145). Il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Boisselle a pris la d\u00e9cision de vendre aux enfants en ao\u00fbt 2011, apr\u00e8s quoi ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 avec les travaux de r\u00e9novation. Cela dit, j\u2019ajouterais que l\u2019appelant a plut\u00f4t insist\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019appelant a dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble en 2012. Si j\u2019ai bien compris les paragraphes pertinents de son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant aurait vendu les unit\u00e9s en mai 2012 quand l\u2019immeuble \u00e9tait inoccup\u00e9 et inutilis\u00e9 emp\u00eachant ainsi qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de bien \u00e0 usage personnel (Avis d\u2019appel aux paras 56-58). \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a fait valoir le fait que M. Boisselle a achet\u00e9 l\u2019immeuble pour en faire un projet de nature commerciale et que l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019immeuble a fait en sorte que \u00ab l\u2019aventure commerciale \u2026 a manifestement mal tourn\u00e9 \u00bb et la disposition a men\u00e9 \u00e0 une perte plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice (Transcription, volume 2 \u00e0 la p 121).\n[48] La preuve de l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019entremise de son t\u00e9moin principal, soit son fils Laurent, fut largement consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 expliquer pourquoi les co\u00fbts de r\u00e9novation de l\u2019immeuble ont explos\u00e9, pour reprendre son expression. Il a d\u00e9crit l\u2019ensemble des difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es lors des r\u00e9novations, soit des probl\u00e8mes avec les murs, le toit, la d\u00e9couverte d\u2019un r\u00e9servoir d\u2019essence, pour n\u2019en nommer que quelques-uns, bref tout ce qui \u00e9voque les histoires de r\u00e9novations cauchemardesques. Cela explique en partie le fait que les r\u00e9novations ont co\u00fbt\u00e9 plus de 2 millions alors que l\u2019appelant les avait estim\u00e9s \u00e0 moins d\u2019un million, sans oublier que les unit\u00e9s 201, 202 et 301 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9nov\u00e9es pour les fins d\u2019occupation par M. Boisselle et les membres de sa famille. M\u00eame si je ne doute pas de l\u2019existence de tous ces d\u00e9fis li\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9novation, je consid\u00e8re que cela ne nous informe pas sur la question de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un projet de nature commerciale.\n[49] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la jurisprudence pour soutenir sa position selon laquelle il n\u2019y a pas lieu de questionner la nature commerciale du projet, r\u00e9trospectivement, apr\u00e8s que les co\u00fbts de r\u00e9novation ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9 ce qui pouvait \u00eatre attendu avant la d\u00e9couverte de nombreux probl\u00e8mes reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019immeuble, ni ne devrait-on \u00e9valuer le sens des affaires du contribuable plut\u00f4t que la nature commerciale de son activit\u00e9 (voir par exemple les affaires Tonn c Canada, [1996] CF 73 (CAF) et Stewart c Canada, 2002 CSC 46, respectivement).\n[50] Je suis d\u2019accord qu\u2019il faut examiner la nature du projet de l\u2019appelant afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un projet de nature commerciale ouvrant droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019une perte finale au moment de la disposition, ou d\u2019un projet de nature mixte, commerciale et r\u00e9sidentielle, faisant en sorte qu\u2019une partie seulement de l\u2019immeuble puisse avoir comme r\u00e9sultat une perte finale d\u00e9ductible dans le calcul du revenu gagn\u00e9 par l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, l\u2019appelant soutient qu\u2019il faille d\u00e9terminer la date de la disposition de l\u2019immeuble.\n[51] Le fait que le projet soit devenu un projet de nature r\u00e9sidentielle en partie ne fait pas l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bat entre les parties. Selon les parties, le d\u00e9bat est plut\u00f4t centr\u00e9 sur la question de savoir \u00e0 quelle date l\u2019appelant a dispos\u00e9 des unit\u00e9s dans l\u2019immeuble. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la vente a eu lieu en octobre 2013, date \u00e0 laquelle les unit\u00e9s 101 et 201 \u00e9taient clairement des unit\u00e9s r\u00e9sidentielles, occup\u00e9es par les enfants de l\u2019appelant, ce qui justifie le refus de la d\u00e9duction de la perte finale par la Ministre.\n[52] L\u2019appelant quant \u00e0 lui, soutient qu\u2019il a dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble en mai 2012, date \u00e0 laquelle 9287, Marie-\u00c8ve ainsi que Laurent et M\u00e9lanie ont emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans l\u2019immeuble, les r\u00e9novations \u00e9tant termin\u00e9es (Transcription, volume 1 \u00e0 la p 115). Pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9novation et aux besoins de transiger avec la ville, il a fallu attendre jusqu\u2019en octobre 2013 pour signer les actes de vente notari\u00e9s. Toutefois, il affirme que le droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois n\u2019exige pas l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte notari\u00e9 pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat de vente.\n[53] L\u2019article 1385 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (RLRQ c CCQ-1991 [Code civil]) pr\u00e9voit comme suit :\n1385. Le contrat se forme par le seul \u00e9change de consentement entre des personnes capables de contracter, \u00e0 moins que la loi n\u2019exige, en outre, le respect d\u2019une forme particuli\u00e8re comme condition n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 sa formation, ou que les parties n\u2019assujettissent la formation du contrat \u00e0 une forme solennelle.\nIl est aussi de son essence qu\u2019il ait une cause et un objet.\n[54] Or, le droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois n\u2019exige pas de forme particuli\u00e8re pour le contrat de vente, tant pour un bien meuble qu\u2019un bien immeuble, de sorte que le contrat existe entre les parties au moment de l\u2019\u00e9change de leur consentement bien qu\u2019aux yeux des tiers, le contrat existe au moment de la publicit\u00e9 au registre appropri\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont clairement exprim\u00e9 leur intention de conclure un contrat d\u2019achat et de vente de l\u2019immeuble.\n[55] Je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 accepter qu\u2019il y eut une entente entre l\u2019appelant et ses enfants concernant l\u2019achat et la vente des unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 de l\u2019immeuble bien longtemps avant le 23 octobre 2013. Et selon le t\u00e9moignage de Laurent, les parties ont convenu que le transfert se ferait \u00e0 la JVM (Transcription, volume 1 \u00e0 la p 65). L\u2019appelant soutient que l\u2019acte notari\u00e9 ne fait que confirmer ce qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu en 2012. \u00c0 partir de ce point-ci, et je le dis avec respect, j\u2019ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre la position de l\u2019appelant et les observations de son avocat \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il semblerait qu\u2019il tentait de justifier le retard relativement aux r\u00e9novations, lequel serait responsable de la date tardive de l\u2019acte notari\u00e9, pour expliquer sa position selon laquelle le contrat de vente de l\u2019immeuble fut conclu en 2012.\n[56] Si la vente des unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 ses enfants a eu lieu en mai 2012 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en octobre 2013, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019appelant, que vendait-il? \u00c0 mon avis, M. Boisselle vendait des unit\u00e9s r\u00e9sidentielles, lesquelles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9nov\u00e9es pour \u00eatre vendues \u00e0 ses enfants et occup\u00e9es par eux. Le fait que les unit\u00e9s \u00e9taient inoccup\u00e9es avant ce moment-l\u00e0 ne change en rien leur caract\u00e8re personnel. Je ne vois pas comment il est possible, en mai 2012, de caract\u00e9riser les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 comme des unit\u00e9s destin\u00e9es \u00e0 une fin commerciale. En fait, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Laurent, d\u00e8s la visite de l\u2019immeuble en ao\u00fbt 2011, les enfants ont manifest\u00e9 leur d\u00e9sir d\u2019habiter dans l\u2019immeuble. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un aide-m\u00e9moire, M. Boisselle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les chiffres relativement aux co\u00fbts pr\u00e9vus pour les r\u00e9novations et comment, en n\u00e9gociant des prix favorables avec des sous-traitants qui sont aussi des clients d\u2019AssurExperts, il pourrait faire un profit. Je note que selon ce document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en novembre 2011 et le t\u00e9moignage de M. Boisselle, les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 Marie-\u00c8ve et Laurent, le 202 \u00e9tant r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant lui-m\u00eame.\n[57] \u00c0 ces circonstances entourant la disposition de l\u2019immeuble, j\u2019ajouterais les faits suivants. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour louer les unit\u00e9s avant l\u2019emm\u00e9nagement par les enfants en mai 2012. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Boisselle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : \u00ab Et puis y\u2019aurait pas besoin de \u2013 de louer parce qu\u2019on \u2013 on s\u2019est entendu que ils (sic) b\u00e2tissaient pour eux autres. Ils s\u2019en venaient rester l\u00e0 \u00bb (Transcription, volume 1 \u00e0 la p 188). En contre-interrogatoire, Laurent a confirm\u00e9 que de telles d\u00e9marches n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises, car \u00ab tout \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 \u00bb (Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 117-118). L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de loyer \u00e0 ses enfants pour la p\u00e9riode \u00e0 partir de mai 2012 quand ils ont emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 et octobre 2013 quand ils ont effectivement achet\u00e9 les unit\u00e9s avec le financement n\u00e9cessaire. Ainsi, l\u2019appelant ne s\u2019est pas comport\u00e9 en homme d\u2019affaires exploitant un projet de nature commerciale. J\u2019ajouterais que lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Laurent a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il visitait le chantier en moyenne deux fois par jour, justifiant cela en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il allait y vivre et qu\u2019il avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait occuper ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019actionnaire de 9287 (Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 72 et 120). Aussi, selon le t\u00e9moignage du v\u00e9rificateur, lors de l\u2019entrevue initiale le 28 mars 2017, l\u2019appelant lui a dit que son but \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois de regrouper sa famille et son travail au m\u00eame endroit (Transcription, volume 1 \u00e0 la p 240 et Pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 5). Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Boisselle abonde dans le m\u00eame sens (voir la Transcription, volume 1 aux pp 151-153).\n[58] Quand les enfants ont emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 en mai 2012, le projet d\u2019achat et de r\u00e9novation de l\u2019immeuble \u00e9tait clairement devenu un projet en partie de nature commerciale et en partie de nature r\u00e9sidentielle. En fait, selon la preuve, je dirais que la nature du projet avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 chang\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2011 quand les enfants ont manifest\u00e9 leur d\u00e9sir de vivre dans l\u2019immeuble. Or, au moment de l\u2019acte notari\u00e9 d\u2019achat en ao\u00fbt 2011, l\u2019intention de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u2019en faire un projet de nature personnelle en partie. Aussi, en novembre 2011, M. Boisselle a examin\u00e9 les chiffres de son projet de r\u00e9novation selon lesquels les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 ses enfants. Je note qu\u2019\u00e0 aucun moment l\u2019appelant n\u2019a-t-il indiqu\u00e9 un changement d\u2019usage d\u2019une partie de l\u2019immeuble. Dans les circonstances, il m\u2019est impossible de conclure que les unit\u00e9s 201 et 301 de l\u2019immeuble constituaient des biens amortissables utilis\u00e9s pour gagner du revenu et pouvant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une perte finale d\u00e9ductible par l\u2019appelant au moment de leur disposition.\nV. Conclusion\n[59] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel des nouvelles cotisations de l\u2019appelante 9287-4775 Qu\u00e9bec inc. \u00e9tablies pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant le 30 avril 2015, 2016 et 2017 est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Pour l\u2019appelante, 9287-4775 Qu\u00e9bec inc., les montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019allocation du co\u00fbt en capital pour les ann\u00e9es en litige sont r\u00e9duits en tenant compte d\u2019une juste valeur marchande de 170 000 $ pour l\u2019unit\u00e9 101 et le garage.\n[60] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel des nouvelles cotisations de l\u2019appelant Georges Boisselle, \u00e9tablies pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017, est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelant, Georges Boisselle, n\u2019a pas le droit de d\u00e9duire une perte finale pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013 ce qui entra\u00eene aussi des cons\u00e9quences fiscales pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014, 2015, 2016 et 2017.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 10e jour de juillet 2023.\n\u00ab Gabrielle St-Hilaire \u00bb\nJuge St-Hilaire\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 97\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-186(IT)G\n2021-187(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nGEORGES BOISSELLE ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI ET 9287-4775 QU\u00c9BEC INC.

Doussot d\u00e9pose un avis d\u2019appel modifi\u00e9 ou un nouvel avis d\u2019appel qui traite des questions suivantes :\n(1) les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente conclue;\n(2) la question de savoir si le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement correspond \u00e0 l\u2019entente r\u00e9ellement conclue;\n(3) la question de savoir si l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation met correctement en oeuvre cette entente;\n(4) tout autre motif de contestation de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\nCes renseignements sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse comprendre pleinement l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de M.

Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate le 30 novembre 2022.\nI. Le contexte\n[2] Le 17 novembre 2020, M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sous le r\u00e9gime de notre proc\u00e9dure informelle. Il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat, et c\u2019est encore le cas. Apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9 eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse, M. Doussot et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont conclu un r\u00e8glement le 11 mars 2022. Le 28 mars 2022, le juge de service a sign\u00e9 le jugement sur consentement qu\u2019on avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 cette semaine\u2011l\u00e0. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement sign\u00e9e par les parties et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour \u00e9tait jointe au jugement. Notre Cour a ferm\u00e9 le dossier le 6 avril 2022.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation le 20 avril 2022, M. Doussot a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocate du minist\u00e8re de la Justice qui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qui avait sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement, ainsi qu\u2019au ministre du Revenu national elle\u2011m\u00eame, un courriel dans lequel il affirmait s\u2019opposer officiellement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation et demandait qu\u2019ils ouvrent de nouveau son dossier \u00e0 la Cour. Il affirmait que l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme au r\u00e8glement. M. Doussot a ensuite envoy\u00e9 plusieurs autres courriels \u00e0 l\u2019avocate du minist\u00e8re de la Justice et au ministre.\n[4] Notre greffe, de bon droit, a transmis les courriels du M. Doussot \u00e0 l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de conna\u00eetre la position de l\u2019avocate. Le greffe a ensuite remis les documents au juge francophone principal de la Cour afin qu\u2019il donne des directives sur la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 donner \u00e0 M. Doussot. En raison de la retraite de la juge en chef adjointe bilingue, le juge en chef avait ordonn\u00e9 que les demandes envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 son cabinet en fran\u00e7ais soient remises au juge francophone principal. Ce juge \u00e9tait et est toujours le juge en chef adjoint par int\u00e9rim de la Cour.\n[5] Le greffe a r\u00e9pondu au courriel de M. Doussot le 24 ao\u00fbt 2022. Un agent du greffe a d\u00e9crit de fa\u00e7on juste ce que M. Doussot devait faire :\n\u00ab Si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas d\u2019accord avec la nouvelle cotisation, vous devez d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du chef des appels \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada.\nSi apr\u00e8s avoir fait ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et que vous n\u2019\u00eates pas satisfait de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada ou si nous n\u2019avez pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse apr\u00e8s 90 jours de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition soumis, vous pouvez d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. \u00bb\nII. Le droit et les r\u00e8gles pertinents\n[6] Notre Cour doit tous les jours rendre des jugements sur consentement et expliquer aux contribuables comment d\u00e9poser leurs documents. C\u2019est sans doute le cas de toutes les cours de premi\u00e8re instance. Les fonctionnaires de notre Cour se d\u00e9vouent chaque jour \u00e0 aider les Canadiens qui doivent traiter avec la Cour, et nos juges font de m\u00eame avec les parties qui comparaissent sans avocat. La r\u00e9putation de notre Cour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard d\u00e9coule de son \u00e9norme travail. Le juge en chef Marc No\u00ebl de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment affirm\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION]\nComme je l'ai dit, plusieurs ont critiqu\u00e9 cette complexit\u00e9 croissante. Mais pensons \u00e9galement aux parties sans avocat qui ne peuvent payer des services juridiques, mais qui doivent faire face aux m\u00eames complexit\u00e9s. Je profite de l'occasion pour rendre hommage aux juges de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t pour leur travail consid\u00e9rable lorsqu'ils aident des parties sans avocat sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle. Ils font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour informer les contribuables de leurs droits, tout en s'assurant de rester impartiaux. Ce n'est pas facile, mais c'est aussi indispensable. Il faut f\u00e9liciter les juges de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t d'avoir recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure informelle afin de promouvoir l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice. Toutes les cours devraient suivre leur exemple. [1]\n[7] Notre Cour conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gale et est tenue, juridiquement et moralement, de ne pas l\u2019outrepasser. Notre Cour, comme toutes les cours sup\u00e9rieures, a la comp\u00e9tence inh\u00e9rente de r\u00e9gler sa propre proc\u00e9dure. De plus, notre Cour a ses propres r\u00e8gles, selon la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et les R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t; le comit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles veille \u00e0 ce que les R\u00e8gles soient utiles et restent \u00e0 jour.\n[8] Le paragraphe 172(2) des R\u00e8gles porte sur le nouvel examen d\u2019appels dans des circonstances exceptionnelles. On peut facilement trouver les R\u00e8gles au site Web de la Cour. Ce paragraphe exige manifestement le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate, et ne s\u2019applique manifestement que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles :\n172(2) Une partie peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate dans l\u2019instance, selon le cas :\na) l\u2019annulation ou la modification d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu;\n172(2) A party who seeks to,\n(a) have a judgment set aside or varied on the ground of fraud or of facts arising or discovered after it was made,\n\u2026\nmay make a motion for the relief claimed.\n[9] Il est difficile de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019envoi de documents par M. Doussot \u00e0 la Cour comme le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate. Notre greffe lui a conseill\u00e9 de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation le plus r\u00e9cent, celui qui met l\u2019entente en oeuvre, et, si l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e avec l\u2019ARC, de d\u00e9poser un nouvel avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 notre Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette nouvelle cotisation et de cette nouvelle opposition. C\u2019est la fa\u00e7on normale et habituelle de demander \u00e0 notre Cour de d\u00e9cider si une entente de r\u00e8glement est valide ou si la nouvelle cotisation qui s\u2019ensuit est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[10] Dans la d\u00e9cision Qu\u00e9bec Fonte inc. c La Reine, 2020 CCI 126, notre Cour a affirm\u00e9 :\nAnalyses et conclusions\n33 La Cour a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si une entente entre le fisc et un contribuable qui \u00e9tablit la mani\u00e8re dont un contribuable doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation est applicable, elle a comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes aux ententes en l\u2019absence de circonstances viciant l\u2019op\u00e9ration, et elle a comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de d\u00e9sistements apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations conformes \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Smerchanski c. Ministre du Revenu national, [1977] 2 R.C.S. 23; l\u2019arr\u00eat University Hill Holdings Inc. c. Canada, 2017 CAF 232; les d\u00e9cisions Oberoi c. La Reine, 2006 CCI 293, 1390758 Ontario Corporation c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 572, Huppe c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 644; SoftSim Technologies Inc. c. La Reine, 2012 CCI 181; Davies c. La Reine, 2016 CCI 104, et Granofsky c. La Reine, 2016 CCI 181.\n34 Dans University Hill, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est dite d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure dans Galway c. Ministre du Revenu national [1974] 1 C.F. 600, qui portait sur les jugements par consentement, et dont les principes s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement aux ententes de r\u00e8glement que notre Cour doit faire appliquer, en pr\u00e9cisant que la Cour doit s\u2019assurer \u00ab que le jugement recherch\u00e9 rel\u00e8ve de sa comp\u00e9tence et qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre rendu \u00bb : voir le paragraphe 66 et suivants. Voir aussi le paragraphe 18 de Huppe, o\u00f9 le juge Webb s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\n[11] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2022 CAF 75) a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Qu\u00e9bec Fonte et a affirm\u00e9, au paragraphe 7 : \u00ab Bref, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que la CCI s\u2019est bien dirig\u00e9e en droit [...] \u00bb.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[12] M. Doussot a interjet\u00e9 appel de la lettre de notre greffe \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans des motifs assez longs (2022 CAF 199), cette Cour a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel et a affirm\u00e9, au paragraphe 14 :\n[...] une telle demande doit \u00eatre faite par requ\u00eate, et non, comme ici, par la voie d\u2019un simple courriel. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un caprice proc\u00e9dural, mais d\u2019une exigence incontournable, puisque pour r\u00e9ussir, un requ\u00e9rant doit prouver que l\u2019annulation ou la modification du jugement en cause est justifi\u00e9e en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que ledit jugement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Cela requiert une preuve, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCI.\nIV. Le nouvel avis d\u2019opposition\n[13] En raison de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour la requ\u00eate, la Cour croit comprendre que le contribuable a effectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un nouvel avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la nouvelle cotisation mettant en oeuvre le jugement sur consentement. Cependant, cette d\u00e9cision et ces documents indiquent clairement que le ministre \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019\u00e9tait pas valable.\n[14] Il semble que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se soit fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 165(1.2) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, qui interdit les oppositions aux nouvelles cotisations mettant en oeuvre des ententes de r\u00e8glement et des jugements sur consentement.\n[15] Pour les raisons expos\u00e9es dans Qu\u00e9bec Fonte, ce paragraphe n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le contribuable qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation apr\u00e8s une entente de r\u00e8glement d\u2019affirmer que cette nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente.\n[16] Selon le paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi, M. Doussot pouvait d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son opposition dans les 90 jours suivant la r\u00e9ponse du ministre. L\u2019article 167 dispose qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, le contribuable peut toujours interjeter appel \u00e0 notre Cour dans un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an.\n[17] M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les documents pour sa requ\u00eate dans ce d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an. Vu les circonstances, la Cour accepte de consid\u00e9rer ces documents comme \u00e9tant \u00e9galement une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. La Cour estime \u00e9galement que ces documents, avec les documents que M. Doussot avait d\u2019abord envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 notre Cour, et vu sa comparution \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, satisfont aux exigences du paragraphe 169(5). M. Doussot peut donc faire appel \u00e0 notre Cour au motif que l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente qu\u2019il a conclue avec l\u2019ARC.\n[18] Il semble que M. Doussot ait \u00e9galement communiqu\u00e9 directement avec le cabinet du ministre du Revenu national. Le ministre a notamment r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019on ne pouvait d\u00e9poser d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la nouvelle cotisation en cause. Cela semble \u00eatre manifestement une erreur de droit, m\u00eame si on ne l\u2019a apparemment pas reconnu lors de l\u2019instance \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Notre Cour est manifestement comp\u00e9tente si on affirme, lors d\u2019un appel, qu\u2019une nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 une entente de r\u00e8glement valide, et cela, malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe 165(1.2) de la Loi, qui dispose :\n[...] aucune opposition ne peut \u00eatre faite par un contribuable \u00e0 une cotisation \u00e9tablie en application des paragraphes [...] 169(3) [...]. Il est entendu que cette interdiction vaut pour les oppositions relatives \u00e0 une question pour laquelle le contribuable a renonc\u00e9 par \u00e9crit \u00e0 son droit d\u2019opposition.\n. . . no objection may be made by a taxpayer to an assessment made under subsection . . . 169(3) . . . nor, for greater certainty, in respect of an issue for which the right of objection has been waived in writing by the taxpayer.\nV. Conclusion\n[19] Malgr\u00e9 le parcours inhabituel, discutable et tr\u00e8s tortueux qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation actuelle, les documents que M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate indiquent clairement ce qui suit :\ni. M. Doussot interjette appel \u00e0 notre Cour de la nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 laquelle il s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 oppos\u00e9;\nii. il conteste la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement;\niii. il affirme que la nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente;\niv. il affirme que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement ne correspond pas \u00e0 l\u2019entente r\u00e9ellement conclue.\n[20] Pour ces motifs, l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate est la suivante :\n1. Le greffe cr\u00e9e un nouveau dossier d\u2019appel. Les documents que M. Doussot a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre un avis d\u2019appel valable d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Au besoin, la Cour accorde une prorogation au titre de l\u2019article 167 de la Loi.\n2. Dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, M. Doussot d\u00e9pose un avis d\u2019appel modifi\u00e9 ou un nouvel avis d\u2019appel qui traite des questions suivantes :\n(1) les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019entente conclue;\n(2) la question de savoir si le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement correspond \u00e0 l\u2019entente r\u00e9ellement conclue;\n(3) la question de savoir si l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation met correctement en oeuvre cette entente;\n(4) tout autre motif de contestation de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\nCes renseignements sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse comprendre pleinement l\u2019avis d\u2019appel de M. Doussot et y r\u00e9pondre. Ils sont \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaires pour que les parties et la Cour se concentrent sur les questions en litige.\n3. L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9pose sa r\u00e9ponse dans les 60 jours suivant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel modifi\u00e9 de M. Doussot.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, Ontario, ce 3e jour de mars 2023.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nLe juge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 26\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2020-2107(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nTONY DOUSSOT ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Patrick Boyle\nDATE DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE :\nLe 3 mars 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nL\u2019appelant lui\u2011m\u00eame\nAvocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe \u00c9liane Mandeville\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nNom :\nCabinet :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle Sous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Allocution \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence annuelle de 2022 de la Fondation canadienne de fiscalit\u00e9, d\u00e9bat des juges, 20 novembre 2022.
