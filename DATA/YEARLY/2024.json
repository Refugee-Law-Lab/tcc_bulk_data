Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 146\nDate: 20240320\nDocket: 2022-1553(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nMICHAEL DiPIERDOMENICO,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nAMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Applicant, Mr. DiPierdomenico, is a mail carrier for Canada Post in Windsor, Ontario. At one time, he also owned a nail salon. That business was audited by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d). The CRA says that the audit concluded with the sending of notices of reassessment for his 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 taxation years, but the Applicant did not serve a notice of objection in time to challenge those reassessments nor did he timely file an application with the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The Applicant says that he never saw any notices of reassessment until retaining his agent, Mr. Fraser Simpson, in late 2019 or early 2020. Mr. Simpson filed an application to this Court on June 9, 2022 for an extension of time to object to those reassessments.[1]\n[3] The Applicant wishes to challenge the reassessments and, to that end, asks this Court to allow his application for an extension of time to object.\nThe Applicant\u2019s Position\n[4] The Applicant says that he \u201cdid not receive the notice [sic] of reassessments\u201d.[2]\nThe Applicant\u2019s Evidence\n[5] The Court heard the Applicant\u2019s evidence virtually and received evidence from the Respondent by way of affidavits from officers of the CRA.\n[6] While hearing the Applicant give his evidence, I was struck by the absence of any records and the vagueness of his recollection. Before the hearing, the Court granted leave for him to testify virtually from his home in Windsor, Ontario. One would have thought that the Applicant would have all relevant documents before him, but he did not ask the Court to enter a single document as evidence.\n[7] For example, the Applicant testified that the CRA correspondence was \u201csporadic at best\u201d but produced no copy or record of any such correspondence. That is an important point as the Applicant rested his case on the non-receipt of notices of reassessment. Did he receive any mail from the CRA? If so, when? Did he receive any mail from other senders? This allegation lacked any factual foundation which is strange, particularly as the Applicant himself is a mail carrier.\n[8] The affidavit evidence offered by the Respondent helped fill numerous gaps in the Applicant\u2019s vague recollection of dates and events. The Applicant adduced no credible evidence to rebut any of the facts in the CRA\u2019s affidavits.\nStatutory Provisions\n[9] I will deal with the reassessments in two groups. The first are the reassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2011, 2012, and 2013 taxation years. The second are the reassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 taxation years. Before doing so, however, I will set out the relevant provisions of the Act and would note that the word \u201cassessment\u201d includes a \u201creassessment\u201d (subsection 248(1) of the Act):\nObjections to assessment\n165(1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual \u2026 on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; \u2026\nExtension of time by Minister\n166.1(1) Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165 \u2026 within the time limited \u2026 for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection \u2026\nWhen order to be made\n166.1(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection \u2026 and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice \u2026 the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2(1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\nWhen application to be granted\n166.2(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection \u2026 and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice \u2026 the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\nReassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2011, 2012, and 2013 Taxation Years\n[10] The CRA says that it sent the following notices of reassessment by mail to the Applicant on the following date:\nNotice of Reassessment for 2011 July 4, 2016\nNotice of Reassessment for 2012 July 4, 2016\nNotice of Reassessment for 2013 July 4, 2016\n[11] The Applicant claims that he did not receive those notices of reassessment. He asks me to conclude that the Minister did not send him those notices on the date indicated on each notice. This is important because under subsection 165(1) of the Act, it is only upon the sending of a notice of assessment or reassessment that the 90-day deadline to serve a notice of objection on the Minister begins to run:\nObjections to assessment\n165(1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual \u2026 on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; \u2026\n[emphasis added]\n[12] For the following reasons, I cannot accept the Applicant\u2019s claim that the Minister did not send him notices of reassessment for 2011, 2012 and 2013 on July 4, 2016:\nthe Applicant confirmed that his address on record with the CRA was indeed his address from 2013 to 2020;\neach notice of reassessment bears that address; and\nthe Applicant sent the Minister a notice of objection in respect of those reassessments.\n[13] The Applicant\u2019s notice of objection was not served until January, 2017 which was well beyond the 90-day deadline set out in subparagraph 165(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. One week after receiving the notice of objection, the CRA wrote to the Applicant informing him that his notice of objection was not validly served as it was not received within the 90-day deadline. The letter went on to say that the Applicant had one year from the expiration of the 90-day period to apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection.[3]\n[14] The Applicant did file an application with the Minister for an extension of time but he waited until May, 2018 to do so. By then, he was beyond the one-year period to apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection under paragraph 166.1(7)(a) of the Act. That period expired in early October, 2017.[4]\n[15] In light of these facts, the Applicant\u2019s agent made no argument in support of the Applicant\u2019s position that notices of reassessment for the 2011, 2012, or 2013 taxation years had not been sent to him by the Minister on July 4, 2016.\nReassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 Taxation Years\n[16] The CRA says that it sent the following notices of reassessment to the Applicant by electronic mail on the following dates:\nNotice of Reassessment for 2015 January 6, 2021\nNotice of Reassessment for 2016 December 24, 2020\n[17] Why did the CRA send those notices by electronic mail? Because the Applicant authorized the CRA to do so.[5] The Applicant enrolled in what the CRA calls \u201cMy Account\u201d which is a secure electronic account from which taxpayers may access correspondence sent to them by the CRA including, among other things, notices of assessment and reassessment.\n[18] The problem here is that the Applicant never filed an application for extension of time with the Minister to serve a notice of objection in respect of the reassessments for his 2015 and 2016 taxation years under section 166.1 of the Act. Such an application must have been made before an applicant may apply to this Court for an extension of time. Subsection 166.2(1) of the Act provides:\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2(1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\n[emphasis added]\n[19] As set out in the Affidavit of Ms. Michele Nguyen of the CRA[6], the Applicant never applied to the Minister for an extension of time to serve notices of objection in respect of his 2015 and 2016 reassessments.[7] That is the end of the matter because subsection 166.2(1) then precludes the Applicant from applying to this Court for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection.\n[20] The Applicant\u2019s failure to meet the condition precedent to apply to this Court for an extension of time is fatal to his application in respect of 2015 and 2016. I will nevertheless review several provisions of the Act dealing with presumptions around the fact of electronic sending and the date of electronic sending as they may become relevant in other applications.\nElectronic Sending of a Notice \u2013 Subsection 244(6.1) of the Act\n[21] The Minister may prove the sending of a notice electronically under subsection 244(6.1) of the Act:\nProof of electronic delivery\n244(6.1) If, by this Act or a regulation, provision is made for sending a notice to a person electronically, an affidavit of an officer of the Canada Revenue Agency sworn before a commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be received as evidence of the sending and of the notice if the affidavit sets out that\n(a) the officer has knowledge of the facts in the particular case;\n(b) the notice was sent electronically to the person on a named day; and\n(c) the officer identifies as exhibits attached to the affidavit copies of\n(i) an electronic message confirming the notice has been sent to the person, and\n(ii) the notice.\n[22] All but one of the requirements of subsection 244(6.1) were met by the Affidavit of Ms. Felicia Colasante of the CRA.[8] Subparagraph 244(6.1)(c)(ii) requires that a CRA officer attach a copy of the notice as an exhibit to an affidavit. Though copies of the notices of reassessment were not attached as exhibits to the Affidavit of Ms. Colasante, they were attached as exhibits to the Affidavit of Ms. Nguyen who attached a reproduction of the notice of reassessment for 2015 as Exhibit \u201cK\u201d and a reproduction of the notice of reassessment for 2016 as Exhibit \u201cL\u201d to her affidavit.\n[23] In my view, the affidavits of Ms. Colasante and Ms. Nguyen, when read together, would meet the requirements of subsection 244(6.1) of the Act. As the Applicant offered no proof to the contrary, I would have received the affidavits of Ms. Colasante and Ms. Nguyen as evidence of the electronic sending of the notices of reassessment for 2015 and 2016.\nDate of Electronic Sending of a Notice \u2013 Subsection 244(14.1) of the Act\n[24] Subsections 244(14) and 244(14.1) of the Act describe the conditions under which a notice is presumed to have been sent electronically by the Minister:\nMailing or sending date\n244(14) For the purposes of this Act, where \u2026 any notice of assessment \u2026 is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice \u2026.\nDate when electronic notice sent\n244(14.1) If a notice \u2026 in respect of an individual \u2026 is made available in electronic format such that it can be read or perceived by an individual or a computer system or other similar device, the notice \u2026 is presumed to be sent to the individual and received by the individual on the date that an electronic message is sent, to the electronic address most recently provided by the individual to the Minister for the purposes of this subsection, informing the individual that a notice \u2026 requiring the individual\u2019s immediate attention is available in the individual\u2019s secure electronic account. A notice \u2026 is considered to be made available if it is posted by the Minister in the individual\u2019s secure electronic account and the individual has authorized that notices or other communications may be made available in this manner and has not before that date revoked that authorization in a manner specified by the Minister.\n[25] Ms. Colasante\u2019s review of the CRA\u2019s records showed that:\na)the Applicant elected to receive email notifications on March 10, 2020 to the email address ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a printout of the screenshot of the Applicant\u2019s record of email address registration, with the Applicant\u2019s social insurance number redacted;\nb)the Applicant\u2019s Reassessment Notices for the 2015 and 2016 taxation years were made available on My Account on January 6, 2021 and December 24, 2020, respectively. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cB\u201d is a printout of the screenshot of the Applicant\u2019s account in the Agency\u2019s Enterprise Correspondence History with respect to the Reassessments; and\nc)the Applicant was sent email notifications on January 6, 2021 and December 4, 2020 to ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||, their email address on file, informing them that there is new Eligible Agency Correspondence available for view in View Mail in the Agency\u2019s My Account portal on their account. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cC\u201d is a printout of the Correspondence Notification History Results, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s Reassessments and their electronic issuance, with the Applicant\u2019s social insurance number redacted.\nFor obvious reasons, the Applicant\u2019s email address has been redacted from the above excerpts.\n[26] As none of the CRA\u2019s evidence was rebutted by the Applicant, I would have made the following findings:\nThe Minister sent the Applicant a notice of reassessment for his 2015 taxation year by electronic mail on January 6, 2021.[9]\nThe Minister sent the Applicant a notice of reassessment for his 2016 taxation year by electronic mail on December 24, 2020.[10]\nConclusions\n[27] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed an application with the Minister for an extension of time to object to the reassessments for his 2011, 2012, and 2013 taxation years was October 3, 2017. He did not do so until May 18, 2018. His application fails because it was not made within the time required by paragraph 166.2(5)(a) of the Act.\n[28] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object to the reassessment for his 2015 taxation year was April 6, 2022. He never did so and is, therefore, precluded from applying to this Court by the final words of subsection 166.2(1) of the Act.\n[29] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object to the reassessment for his 2016 taxation year was March 24, 2022. He never did so and is, therefore, precluded from applying to from this Court by the final words of subsection 166.2(1) of the Act.\nDisposition\n[30] For all of these reasons, the Applicant\u2019s application under subsection 166.2(1) of the Act for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection on the Minister in respect of reassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 taxation years is dismissed, without costs.\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated September 29, 2023.\nSigned at Hamilton, Ontario, this 20th day of March 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction\n[1] The Appellant has instituted an appeal under the informal procedure in respect of an assessment made under the Income Tax Act (ITA) by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister), for the 2018 taxation year. By virtue of this assessment, the Minister imposed a penalty of $5,858 under subsection 227(9) ITA upon alleged late remittances of payroll source deductions for the 2018 year in the total amount of $61,084.96.\n[2] Subsection 227(9) ITA reads as follows:\nWithholding taxes\nPenalty\n(9) Subject to subsection 227(9.5), every person who in a calendar year has failed to remit or pay as and when required by this Act or a regulation an amount deducted or withheld as required by this Act or a regulation or an amount of tax that the person is, by section 116 or by a regulation made under subsection 215(4), required to pay is liable to a penalty of\n(a) subject to paragraph (b), if\n(i) [\u2026],\n(ii) the Receiver General receives that amount\n(A) [\u2026],\n(B) [\u2026], or\n(C) [\u2026], or\n(iii) that amount is not paid or remitted on or before the seventh day after it was due, 10% of that amount; or\n(b) where at the time of the failure a penalty under this subsection was payable by the person in respect of an amount that should have been remitted or paid during the year and the failure was made knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, 20% of that amount.\n[3] The penalty imposed in the present case was 10%.\n[4] The decision of the Minister to impose the penalty is essentially the result of a conflict between the parties over the salaries paid by the Appellant to two employees. The Appellant has determined, at the end of 2018, a final remuneration to each employee for the year. After having completed a trust accounts examination of the Appellant\u2019s payroll for that year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) determined a different salary allocation between the two employees, which resulted in a restatement of the Appellant\u2019s remittances of payroll deductions under the ITA and the applicable regulations. The penalty is based on the Appellant\u2019s late remittances.\n[5] The sole shareholder, director and officer of the Appellant is Mr. Allan Sutton. The Appellant operates a real estate business as a licence real estate corporation, as opposed to a personal real estate corporation. Mr. Sutton is a real estate sales agent and is referred to as the primary source of revenue for the Appellant. Mrs. Angela Sutton, Mr. Sutton\u2019s spouse, is also employed by the Appellant. She is a licensed broker acting as the managing broker for the Appellant\u2019s real estate activities. Her status allows the Appellant to qualify as a licence real estate corporation. With Mrs. Sutton, the Appellant can carry on business without depending on a brokerage firm. Mr. Sutton describes this advantage as a higher standard requiring the corporation to keep trust accounts, to do accounting reports, to file annual reports with the provincial Financial Services Authority. Mr. Sutton adds that with a higher standard comes governance at a much higher level.\n[6] Mr. and Mrs. Sutton are the two employees of the Appellant. For many years, the Appellant, through Mr. and Mrs. Sutton\u2019s arrangement, determines at the end of the year the contribution that each made to the Appellant\u2019s success and revenues for the given year. Mr. Sutton testified that Mrs. Sutton is a key addition to the Appellant\u2019s activities and, without her, the Appellant\u2019s success would certainly be different. She allows him to focus on specific aspects of the Appellant\u2019s business while she is responsible for all other tasks. In addition, she assists him on particular mandates in the year. She may also find referrals. For Mr. Sutton, she is an asset for the corporation and deserves a fair recognition.\n[7] For 2018, the Appellant made payroll deductions remittances based on an estimate salary for each employee. At the end of the year, the two employees carried out their review of the year and determined a salary based on their contributions in the business. Prescribed forms and slips for 2018 were filed by the Appellant on that basis. In summary, Mrs. and Mr. Sutton received a total remuneration of $165,000 and $192,000, respectively.\n[8] By notice of assessment dated February 11, 2020, the Minister assessed the Appellant a late balance payroll deductions remittance for 2018 of $1,745 and a 10% corresponding penalty of $124. This assessment was made following the trust accounts examination by the CRA. The CRA determined, inter alia, a different remuneration allocation between the two employees based from amounts deposited in Mrs. and Mr. Sutton\u2019s personal bank accounts of cheques received from the Appellant.\n[9] A second assessment by notice of assessment dated February 11, 2020, was also made in respect of the Appellant\u2019s 2018 payroll remittances strictly to levy a 10% late remittance penalty in the amount of $5,858. This second penalty relates to a reallocation of the monthly payroll remittances by the CRA that the Appellant should have done on the basis of the new remuneration allocation between the two employees. Only this second assessment is under appeal.\n[10] This appeal is to dispose of a penalty. The Respondent acknowledged at the hearing that the Crown bears the onus for the penalty. This means that if the reallocation of remuneration determined by the Respondent is incorrect or, I should say, is not proved by the Respondent, there is no reason to maintain the penalty.\n[11] The Respondent did not call any witness in support of his position. Counsel for the Respondent confirmed that the only basis for the Minister to make this redetermination of remuneration among the two employees is after the sole review of the banking statements of the Appellant, copies of Appellant\u2019s cheques and to whom the cheques were made payable. Based on this sole review, cheques and banking statements confirmed that the total amount for the remuneration for both employees was deposited in Mr. Sutton\u2019s personal bank account, except for a total amount of $12,675 deposited in Mrs. Sutton\u2019s personal bank account.\n[12] The Court did not hear from any CRA\u2019s officers or employees. During the trust accounts examination by the CRA, the Appellant was not called or asked to explain the reasons for supporting the payment option retained by the Appellant, nor Mrs. Sutton, Mr. Sutton or their accountant.\n[13] For the Court, the procedure followed by the CRA to carry out the examination is not the most convincing. The procedure reflects clearly a selective review, which gives the appearance of a partial examination only of the actual context. This is particularly apparent in the absence of any testimony from the CRA to support their position and of any contact during the trust accounts audit with the interested parties. This is rather problematic in a context where the burden lies with the Respondent.\n[14] Mrs. and Mr. Sutton testified at the hearing. The Court considers both being credible. Both showed a knowledge of the Appellant\u2019s business and were able to explain in reasonable terms the considerations surrounding their decision to fix the remuneration paid by the Appellant.\n[15] Mr. Sutton was the first to testify. In summary, the witness did not deny the amounts paid to them by the Appellant. He exposed how they agree on their remuneration and when they do so. He is signing the Appellant\u2019s cheques. The Court understands that this is a relatively small business and given the volatility of the markets, it can be difficult to predict a fair compensation without knowing what has been achieved by each of them until the end of the year. He explained the reasons why his spouse was receiving a small monthly pay payable to her directly and what was the origin of the amount. Mrs. Sutton also confirmed the same reasons for being a monthly fee that she used to charge other real estate firms in consideration of basic brokerage services.\n[16] He did not deny that both remunerations were in fact deposited through his personal bank account in one single cheque that he signs based on the available cash flow of the Appellant from time to time. He did not confirm that the deposit was his alone. He also confirmed that the procedure could have been different and he could have signed two cheques. He did not think that this was determinant as far as they both agree on the procedure and the final allocation they determine at the end of the year. For him, the deposits in one single account and the right to a fair remuneration were distinct and one was certainly not a pledge of the other.\n[17] Mrs. Sutton testified about on her own understanding of her remuneration. She was relatively brief but clear and truthful. The Court did not believe that her role was marginal, but a real employee to whom remuneration is payable in return of a real performance. She testified that her work performance overall could vary over the years, with each year having to assume her responsibilities as a licence broker.\n[18] Mrs. Sutton explained that for her the fact that her remuneration was deposited in her spouse\u2019s personal bank account was not a concern. She was able to benefit from that money. She made it clear that she consented to this arrangement and gave her authorization that the money be deposited in one single account. Her way to explain the situation was that \u201c\u2026 I was constructively receiving money through our account. So, the account would pay for my personal direct bills, visa, and it would also pay for our share expenses.\u201d\n[19] The cross-examination did not allow the Respondent to demolish the positions expressed by both witnesses. However, it is not excluded that Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-7 filed by the Appellant show a certain discrepancy as for the exact determination of the salary paid to each employee. This is due in part to the fact confirmed by Mrs. Sutton about the percentage of common expenses that she supported in 2018. She confirmed that her share of the common expenses was 11%, not 50%. This confirmation might be false or might be correct. For that reason, the allocation as initially determined between the Appellant and the employees would then be incorrect.\n[20] Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, it remains clear for the Court that the remuneration paid to Mrs. Sutton in 2018 exceeded $12,675. The fact that such remuneration has been in part paid to Mrs. Sutton through Mr. Sutton\u2019s bank account does not preclude the position of Mrs. Sutton and the Appellant that she received the remuneration from the Appellant. Considering that the evidence supports that Mrs. Sutton authorized the amounts be directed into Mr. Sutton\u2019s bank account and she still derived benefit from the deposit to that account, and had an unconditional right to be paid the remuneration, constructive receipt applies.\n[21] Constructive receipt, for purposes of the ITA, has two central factors that allow funds to be \u201creceived\u201d by a taxpayer even if they do not directly have it \u201cin their hands\u201d. Under subsection 5(1) ITA income is salary received by a taxpayer in a year. Case law has noted that the word \u201creceive\u201d means to get or to derive benefit from something, therefore to \u201cenjoy its advantages without necessarily having it in one\u2019s hands\u201d [1]. Moreover, an amount of money is deemed received by an employee when it is available to the employee [2]. An example of this was seen in Blenkarn, where the money to pay the taxpayer\u2019s salary in 1960 was available [to the taxpayer] but he voluntarily chose not to be paid until 1961. The taxpayer was considered to have actually received the money because the payment was held to be \u201creceived\u201d as soon as he had an unconditional right to be paid, which was in 1960.\n[22] In Markman [3], this Court stated that when money is paid by an employer to a third party for the benefit of the taxpayer, the payment constitutes constructive receipt in the hands of the taxpayer. Justice Bowman in Belusic [4], noted that for a finding of constructive receipt one, or both, of the following two conditions must be satisfied:\n(1) The appellant would need to have authorized or in any event acquiesced in the payment; or\n(2) Even in the event he had not authorized or acquiesced in the payment, at least he would have had to be under a legal obligation to make the repayment so that the payment\u2026 had the effect of relieving him of that obligation\n[23] Justice Bowman\u2019s factors for finding constructive receipt have been cited in subsequent cases. More recently this Court in Sherman [5], in citing Morin, stated the theory of constructive receipt is that the payee did not receive the amount in question but need only receive a corresponding benefit. These concepts have been echoed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Cheema [6], citing Innovative Installation [7], held that constructive receipt could apply where a person had a contractual right to receive a payment.\n[24] This Court is of the view that the evidence in this appeal supports that constructive receipt applies with respect to Mrs. Sutton\u2019s remuneration received from the Appellant.\n[25] As mentioned above, although this Court cannot confirm the exact remuneration received by Mrs. Sutton, and indirectly by Mr. Sutton, it remains clear that the remuneration used by the CRA to assess the penalty is incorrect.\n[26] In Simard [8], the Federal Court of Appeal provided insight as to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction regarding the imposition, and ruling of, penalties. Simard was an issue of gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) ITA, however, the Federal Court of Appeal used broad language in commenting on the extent to which this Court can interfere with the imposition of penalties. The Court of Appeal stated:\nThe Minister's decision regarding a penalty may be challenged by appeal to the Tax Court of Canada against the assessment levying it, but where the Court finds that the facts give rise to a penalty it can only confirm its application. As the Minister, the Court has no discretion as to the amount of the penalty, nor does it have any regarding interest.\n[27] In Portland [9], Justice Mogan stated:\nThe obligations to withhold are inflexible and the obligations to remit are equally inflexible. The penalty authorized under subsection 227(9) is fixed by statute, and this Court does not have authority to reduce the penalty or cancel it because it is imposed by Parliament. If the conditions are met which permit the penalty to come into play (a late remittance), then the liability is fixed.\n[28] The role of the Court is to determine whether the penalty was either validly imposed or not. There is no other issue under appeal. And adjusting the quantum of a given penalty would be beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. On that basis, it is determined that the evidence in the present case does not support that the conditions to levy the penalty as determined by the Minister have been established. In fact, the remuneration received by the employees and used by the Minister to assess the penalty is incorrect and necessarily result in an erroneous penalty.\n[29] Based on the foregoing, the facts of this appeal do not give rise to the penalty as determined by the Minister. The Court has no authority in respect of a penalty other than to allow (deny the penalty) or dismiss (confirm the penalty) the appeal. Consequently, the appeal is allowed, without costs.\nSigned at Belleville, Ontario, this 8th day of January 2024.\n\u201cJ.M.

Those companies operate their vehicles in both Canada and the United States of America. In its returns for its reporting periods ended between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016, the Appellant claimed input tax credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) in respect of its activities. The Minister of National Revenue denied those ITCs on the basis that all of the Appellant's supplies were exempt supplies. The Appellant appealed that denial.\nZero-Rated Supplies\n[2] This appeal originally came before me in 2020. The primary issue was one of statutory interpretation of paragraph 2(d) of Part IX of Schedule VI of the Excise Tax Act. That paragraph treats a supply made by a financial institution of a financial service that relates to an insurance policy issued by the institution as a zero-rated supply to the extent that it relates to risks that are ordinarily situated outside Canada.\n[3] In my original decision on this appeal (2020 TCC 132), I conducted a textual, contextual and purposive analysis and concluded that paragraph 2(d) treats the supply of an insurance policy as zero-rated to the extent that the objects of the insurance policy (in this case the insured\u2019s trucks) are ordinarily situated outside Canada.\n[4] The Federal Court of Appeal overturned my decision (2023 FCA 211) and referred the appeal back to me.\n[5] The FCA held that paragraph 2(d) treats the supply of an insurance policy as zero-rated to the extent that the policy insures against the risk of a claim arising from an accident or other insurable event that is ordinarily situated outside Canada. More specifically, the FCA concluded that \u201c[t]o the extent that any insurance policy issued by [the Appellant] covered such risks that were ordinarily situated in the United States, the supply of such a policy would be a zero-rated supply.\u201d[1]\n[6] Having determined how paragraph 2(d) should be interpreted, the FCA then instructed that \u201c[t]he next question is to what extent were the policies issued by [the Appellant], policies that related to risks that were usually situated outside Canada. This determination would be based on the chance or likelihood of an accident occurring in the United States and the potential loss arising from such accident.\u201d[2]\n[7] The FCA was clear that that analysis does not involve looking at each insured vehicle individually, but rather at each insurance policy.[3]\nStill Insufficient Evidence\n[8] As I stated at paragraph 73 of my original decision, \u201c[a]ll of the evidence presented at trial was global evidence. I do not have any specific evidence regarding the individual policies in issue\u2026Without this evidence, it is impossible for me to determine whether the supply of any given policy was partly zero-rated. This lack of evidence is a sufficient basis for me to dismiss the appeals and I do so on that basis.\u201d\n[9] My conclusion on this point has not changed. The appeals are dismissed.\nClarification\n[10] The FCA observed that I had noted at paragraph 81 of my reasons that \u201c[t]here was extensive evidence regarding how the Appellant priced its insurance policies.\u201d The FCA sent the appeal back to me on the basis that \u201c[i]n order to determine to what extent [the Appellant\u2019s] insurance policies covered potential claims arising from accidents that usually occur outside Canada, it would be necessary to examine the evidence that the Tax Court Judge did not consider.\u201d[4]\n[11] It appears that my statement at paragraph 81 may have left the FCA with the wrong impression. Having concluded at paragraph 73 of my reasons that I did not have sufficient evidence regarding the individual policies in issue to determine whether the supply of any given policy was zero-rated, I stated at paragraph 74 that, since \u201cthe parties went to a great deal of effort to set out the factual foundation of this appeal and to apply their understandings of the law to those facts\u2026I feel that it is appropriate to provide some guidance as to how I would have applied section 2 had the appropriate evidence been before me.\u201d [emphasis added]\n[12] The paragraphs that followed, including paragraph 81, described factors that I would have considered.\n[13] At paragraph 81, I stated that there was extensive evidence regarding how the Appellant priced its policies. It would evidently have been clearer if I had stated that there was extensive evidence of the methodology that the Appellant used to price its policies but no evidence of how any given policy was priced.\n[14] Had I had evidence of how each of the Appellant\u2019s policies was priced, based on the FCA\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 2(d), I would now most likely be able to determine to what extent each policy was zero-rated. My understanding is that that pricing is based, in part, on the chance or likelihood of an accident occurring in the United States and the potential loss arising from such accident in respect of a given policy. However, without that evidence I have no choice but to, once again, dismiss the Appellant\u2019s appeal.\nThis Amended Reasons for Judgment is issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated January 18, 2024.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

More specifically the Appellant was denied the deduction of non\u2011capital losses of $2,878,871 in 2010 and non-capital losses of $26,196,711, SR&ED expenditures of $23,229,238 and net capital losses of $347,424 in 2011 - all being or relating to the tax attributes acquired by the Appellant from an unrelated party.\n[2] This is another loss\u2013trading case.\nOverview:\n[3] While the factual details can be overwhelming and appropriate relevant facts will be analysed in more detail in the analyses portions of this decision, a more concise view of the transactions in play are useful from the beginning. I will divide them into two parts to essentially reflect the two main parties involved in these transactions. I will also give a more simplistic bird\u2019s eye view of these transactions and the result they achieved that is the subject matter of this appeal.\nThe Seller\n[4] On the one hand, we have two individuals, a Mr. Tonken and Mr. Mathews, who through several corporate entities were in the business of identifying failed corporations through their contacts in the investment community, inserted themselves into their management and used their expertise to effect steps necessary to essentially clean them for acquisition by other viable companies looking to use their public existence to facilitate the raising of capital or to access their tax losses or other attributes.\n[5] In the case at hand, these gentlemen identified Xillix Biotechnologies Corp. (\u201cXillix\u201d), a widely held public company with no ascertainable controlling shareholder or group of shareholders, as a failed medical imaging company that had a large pool of unused non-capital losses and other tax attributes involved here. It had sought protection under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (\u201cCCAA\u201d) of British Columbia and given the opportunity to develop a reorganization plan by the BC Supreme Court to maximize value for its stakeholders.\n[6] Through Cavalon Capital Partners Ltd (\u201cCavalon\u201d) an agreement dated July 9, 2007 was made with Xillix (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) to invest $4.4 million dollars in Xillix by way of convertible debenture, based on paying $0.055 per dollar of its usable tax losses of $84 million, of which $3.6 million was to pay off its creditors remaining after the sale of its other assets satisfied other secured creditors and $800,000 was to be retained as capital to maintain itself as a publicly traded company with its listing on a stock exchange, including paying salaries to the aforementioned gentlemen, until a sale transaction of its attributes was complete.\n[7] In return, Cavalon would be able to convert 94.5% ($4,160,000) of its debenture into 45% of the voting shares and 100% of a newly created class of non\u2011voting shares so as to give it 80% of the equity in Xillix with the balance of the debenture loan remaining turned into a $240,000 non-interest bearing unsecured demand loan. In addition, the officers and directors of Xillix would resign and be replaced by nominees of Cavalon, i.e. the aforementioned gentlemen and their friendly nominees, and the name of the corporation would be changed from Xillix to Biomerge Industries Ltd. (\u201cBiomerge\u201d) and be delisted from the TSX and relisted to the smaller NEX exchange, a subboard of the TSX Venture exchange that did not have a minimum listing requirement. There was no difference in the underlying rights of the voting and newly created non\u2013voting common shares, other than the vote, so both participated equally via dividends and distribution on any wind-up. The parties understood this was to avoid a change in control to preserve the losses of Xillix.\n[8] Another of the gentlemen\u2019s corporations, which had the ability to borrow funds, and in fact did, to allow the loan to Xillix to be made, Nexia Biotechnologies Inc., bought the shares of Cavalon, which had no other assets other than its rights in the agreement with Xillix, and then amalgamated with Cavalon to form Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. (\u201cNexia\u201d) and became the successor to Cavalon in the Investment Agreement.\n[9] Before completion of the agreement, the CEO of Xillix died and Xillix was placed into Receivership with Mr. Vermette of PWC, who had acted as Monitor beforehand. The remaining officers and directors of Xillix resigned at such time and in order to continue its corporate existence and meet its securities and other regulatory requirements, as well as have someone sign the necessary documents to complete the agreement and restructuring plan, Messrs. Tonken and Mathews agreed to act as directors and officers before completion thus enabling them to complete the plan.\n[10] The Restructuring plan that gave affect to the above agreement was completed on September 24, 2007, after an amendment dated September 7, 2007 requested by Cavalon, that changed the original Restructuring plan approved by the Court to delete the requirement for Xillix to be first placed then removed from bankruptcy and that amended the terms of the non-voting shares so as to delete their convertibility feature into voting shares. The latter was done to ensure de jure control would not be acquired by the issuance of such shares. The Court approved the Restructuring plan as amended and dispensed with the approval of the then existing shareholders of Xillix on the basis they would have received no payout from the plan. The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that the only chance the original shareholders had in obtaining any value for their investment in Xillix was on a sale of its tax attributes via the completion of the Investment Agreement and restructuring contemplated therein. They had no choice and went along.\n[11] Messrs. Tonken and Mathews then proceeded to market Xillix through the investment community as a cleansed entity no longer carrying on business, having its tax attributes and public company existence as its only assets, and having no other debts or obligations other than to Nexia who now held 45% of the voting shares, 100% of the non-voting common shares and 80% of its total equity and the aforementioned demand promissory note for $240,000.00.\n[12] The above transactions are generally described by the parties in their pleadings and argument as the CCAA Plan transactions and I will refer to them as the CCAA transactions or series.\nThe Buyer:\n[13] On the other hand, we have an Income Trust by the name of Total Energy Services Trust (\u201cTotal\u201d), an Alberta mutual fund trust whose units were listed and traded on the TSX, which conducted its businesses of contract drilling services and the manufacture and rental of equipment to the gas and oil exploration and production companies in western Canada through its direct and indirect subsidiaries; mainly Total Energy Services Limited (\u201cTESL\u201d).\n[14] Due to changes in the Act, which proposed to level the playing field between Income Trust structures and Corporations by imposing additional taxes on Income Trusts through what are generally described as the SIFT Rules in the Act, Total decided it would convert to a corporate structure to: remain competitive from a tax perspective and in its ability to raise funds on the market, retain some of its major investors who threatened to sell their interest if there was no corporate conversion, and address concerns that the new rules would restrict growth by limiting its ability to undertake significant acquisitions. This was noted by the CEO of Total, Mr. Halyk but disputed by the Respondent.\n[15] Lo and behold, Total was introduced to Biomerge through the efforts of intervening investment advisors and, after exploring other possibilities, decided Biomerge was exactly the type of entity it would prefer to merge with using the trust unit for shares exchange method provided by the SIFT Rules, it being a clean corporation with no creditors or active business and with the benefit of having been cleaned through the CCAA Court ordered process, not to mention the fact it had valuable tax attributes in the nature of unused losses and deductions.\n[16] Accordingly, Total entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Biomerge pursuant to which a Plan of Arrangement set out the numerous steps to occur on an effective date that would: amend the Deed of Trust of Total to allow its trust units to be transferred to Biomerge, create articles of continuance for Biomerge (from BC to Alberta) that would provide for a new class of common shares (\u201cNew Common Shares\u201d) that would be exchanged for the trust units and a portion of the existing voting common shares of Biomerge, exchange the 29,050,000 outstanding trust units of Total on a one for one basis to 29,050,000 New Common Shares of Biomerge, provide that the total of 248,941,152 existing common voting shares of Biomerge would be exchanged for $702,293 in cash and 56,730 New Common Shares, cash out the existing 435,647,055 non-voting common shares of Biomerge for $1,695,185, deposit with its solicitors in trust, a sum of cash of $1,247,401 equal to Biomerge\u2019s liabilities in return for a demand promissory note , change the name of Biomerge to Total Energy Services Inc. (\u201cNew Total\u201d) and replace the existing officers and directors of Biomerge with the officers and directors of TESL, the earlier referred to subsidiary of Total.\n[17] It should be noted that the total consideration to be paid to the shareholders of Biomerge through a combination of cash and shares of New Total was $3.9 million negotiated by the parties based on paying $0.052 per dollar on the total of non-capital losses and SR&ED expenditures in the Biomerge tax pool.\n[18] The above arrangements and transactions became effective May 20, 2009 after approval of the Total Plan of Arrangement by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta on May 15, 2009 and New Total commenced trading on the TSX after substituting old Total\u2019s listing for New Total. At this time 99.8% of the equity in New Total belonged to the original trust unit holders of Total and only 0.2% to the then shareholders of Biomerge.\n[19] After May 20, 2009, Total (and its sub-trusts) were wound up pursuant to s.88.1(2) of the Act as result of which the assets of Total Trust, mainly its shares in and debenture loan to its subsidiary, TESL, became the assets of New Total.\n[20] On January 1, 2010, New Total and TESL amalgamated into the Appellant, Total Energy Services Inc. so that the tax pools of New Total and TESL became those of the Appellant, including obviously the tax pools that had belonged to Biomerge traced back to Xillix that were denied by the Minister here.\n[21] Total Trust expended approximately $4.8 million inclusive of the $3.9 million consideration to Biomerge shareholders discussed above and the transaction costs to implement the transactions here.\n[22] This group of transactions are referred to by the parties as the Total Arrangement or Total Conversion transactions and I will henceforth refer to them at the Total Conversion transactions or series.\nBird\u2019s Eye View:\n[23] In my view, the above CCAA transactions and Total Conversion transactions reflect a vendor of inactive but existing shell corporations, with tax losses and securities exchange registrations, marketing and selling such attributes on the open market to a willing and unrelated buyer, who ended up acquiring and using such losses against its income from a business totally different from that of the original corporation, almost entirely for the benefit of new shareholders. The role of this Court will be to determine whether any of such transactions which gave rise to the aforesaid result violates the GAAR.\nGAAR\n[24] Section 245 of the Act is the GAAR. Although I will refer to the specific provisions in more detail during this analysis, there is no dispute that it is well established law that three conditions must be me for the GAAR to apply:\n(1) Was there a tax benefit?\n(2) Was there an avoidance transaction or a series of transactions that included an avoidance transaction that resulted in the tax benefit; and,\n(3) Were any of the avoidance transactions abusive?\n[25] In this case, there is no dispute that we are not dealing with a sole transaction but a series of transactions so my reference to the applicable GAAR provisions will reflect that.\n[26] I will address each of the conditions specifically and set out the position of the parties thereon within that analysis.\n(1) Was there a tax benefit? [27] The Appellant concedes in argument that the use of the Biomerge tax attributes in 2010 and 2011 by the Appellant that resulted in the reduction of tax was a tax benefit and the subject matter of the Minister\u2019s reassessment in this appeal.\n[28] While it is clear this first condition has been met, I believe it is important to note that the Respondent describes the tax benefit as \u201cthe preservation, carry\u2011forward and use of the Biomerge Tax Attributes\u201d in paragraph 27 of its written submissions as well as paragraph 11(uu) of the Reply. As the Appellant\u2019s counsel had pointed out in argument, only the use of these attributes can be considered the tax benefit for the purpose of this appeal. The legislative changes made by Parliament in Budget 2022 to amend the definition of \u201ctax benefit\u201d to include the preservation and carry-forward of tax attributes did not form part of the definition of \u201ctax benefit\u201d applicable to this appeal. The applicable definition reads as follows:\n245(1)\u2026a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act\u2026\n[29] Clearly, this definition contemplates that the tax attributes must have been used as confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in the decisions of Wild v. Canada, 2018 FCA 114 at paragraphs 30-39 and Gladwin Realty Corporation v. Canada 2020 FCA 142 at paragraph 47.\n(2) Was there a series of transactions that included avoidance transactions that resulted in the tax benefit? [30] Section 245(3) defines \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d as a transaction that results in a tax benefit, either by itself or as part of a series of transactions \u201cunless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for a bona fide purpose other than to obtain a tax benefit\u201d. [See Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. V Canada 2005 SCC 54 (\u201cCanada Trustco\u201d) at par 22 and Copthorne Holdings Ltd. V Canada 2011 SCC 63 (\u201cCopthorne\u201d) at par 39]\n[31] A \u201ctransaction\u201d is widely defined to include an arrangement or an event in s.245(1) of the Act.\n[32] It is also established law that the burden is on the taxpayer to refute the Minister\u2019s assumption regarding the primary purpose of the series and of each transaction forming part of the series and that only one transaction in the series must be found to be an avoidance transaction in order to satisfy the requirements of s.245(3) [See Copthorne at par 63 and 64].\n[33] It is agreed that the Court must determine: 1. what transactions make up the relevant series of transactions for the purposes of the GAAR analyses and whether the Tax benefit resulted from such series, and 2. whether every transaction within that series was undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit.\nSeries of transactions that resulted in a Tax Benefit\n[34] As set out in Copthorne at par 43, citing OSFC Holdings Ltd. V Canada, 2001 FCA 260 at paragraph 24, the starting point is the common law series where each transaction is preordained to produce the final result.\n[35] At the beginning of this decision, reference is made to two sets of transactions the parties generally refer to as the CCAA transactions and the Total Conversion transactions. The parties generally agree that these each constitute a series of transactions with few minor exceptions; namely that according to the Appellant, some of the transactions in the CCAA transactions should not be included in that series if it becomes part of a larger series under s.248(10) to be discussed herein. There were other Transactions the parties referred to as the \u201cOther Transactions\u201d which are not necessary to set out in detail here as they are not consequential to the determination of this matter.\n[36] There is no dispute that each of the aforesaid series would only be separate Common Law Series and do not form part of one large Common Law Series so there is no need to reference the Appellant\u2019s argument in this respect although its essentially uses similar arguments with respect to the real dispute.\n[37] The real dispute between the parties centers on the issue of whether the two Common Law Series are joined in their entirely or only partially pursuant to Section 248(10) of the Act, which serves to expand a common law series.\n[38] Section 248(10) provides:\nFor the purposes of this Act, where there is reference to a series of transactions or events, the series shall be deemed to include any related transactions or events completed in contemplation of the series.\n[39] The Respondent takes the position that both common law series are joined in their entirety pursuant to Section 248(10) while the Appellant argues only the transactions that preserved the reporting issuer status and eliminated the claims of creditors should be added and not any of the CCAA transactions that involved preserving the Biomerge Tax attributes including any of the Cavalon\/Nexia\u2019s investment and ownership interest in Biomerge (originally Xillix).\n[40] The Appellant\u2019s arguments are two-fold. First, the Appellant argues that since there is no material judicial consideration of the term \u201crelated\u201d as referenced in the phrase \u201crelated transactions or events\u201d that we must use the basic principles of interpretation to find that the term must have meaning and that the dictionary definitions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and Webster\u2019s Dictionary of the English language which define \u201crelated\u201d means that related transactions must mean that only transactions that are connected in some way, or have a relationship to the Total Conversion transactions should be considered related transactions under S.248(10).\n[41] The Appellant\u2019s position seems to be predicated on their submission that the only reason they entered into the deal with Biomerge was to access a cleansed corporation with reporter issuer status. With all due respect, this position totally ignores the overwhelming evidence that the acquisition of Biomerge tax attributes was, at the very least, a significant portion of the Total Conversion series and one of the reasons for the transactions; putting aside for the moment whether it was the primary reason. The Appellant sought out companies with significant losses, based its price on $0.052 per dollar of tax attributes, required a minimum of at least $70 million dollars in such attributes as a condition of closing, undertook due diligence with respect to their availability for use and negotiated with the principals and representatives of Nexia in relation thereto. Accordingly, any transaction within the CCAA transactions that related to the preservation of the Biomerge Tax attributes was extremely relevant using the Appellant\u2019s own rationale. The preservation of Biomerge tax attributes had great relevance to Total.\n[42] Moreover, the Investment Agreement pursuant to which Cavalon (later Nexia) was to inject $4.4 million dollars into Xillix of which $3.6 million was to be used to \u201ccleanse\u201d it by paying off creditors is the same agreement that provided for the ability to convert such debt to shares that took place pursuant to the Restructuring Plan. I fail to see how these transactions are not related.\n[43] Secondly, the Appellant argues that since the Trust Conversion Rules (SIFT) rules were released 9 months after the September 24, 2007 date when the CCAA transactions were completed there was no way for Biomerge to contemplate being involved in a trust conversion or how conversions would be effected. In earlier argument pertaining to delineating the Common Law Series, the Appellant also made reference to the fact that none of Xillix, Cavalon, Nexia or their principals had any knowledge of Total at the time the CCAA transactions were undertaken or completed.\n[44] In Copthorne, at paragraphs 42-54, the SCC analysed in detail the second condition for applying GAAR and clearly provided material judicial consideration of related transactions or events completed in contemplation of the series per 248(10) of the Act. At paragraph 54 the SCC states:\n[54]\u2026 nothing suggests that the related transaction must be completed in contemplation of a subsequent series. The context of the provision is to expand the definition of a series which is an indication against a narrow interpretation.\n[45] In fact, at paragraph 56 the SCC stated that the language of s.248(10) allows either a prospective or retrospective connection of a related transaction to a common law series.\n[46] In determining whether a related transaction was done in contemplation of another series, the SCC in Copthorne, paragraphs 46-47 stated that:\n[46]\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201cThe Court is only required to consider\u201d whether the series was taken into account when the decision was made to undertake the related transaction in the sense it was done \u201cin relation to\u201d or \u201cbecause of\u201d the series.\n[47] Although the \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cin relation to\u201d test does not require a strong nexus, it does require more than a \u201cmere possibility\u201d or a connection with \u201can extreme degree of remoteness\u201d\u2026\u2026 Each case will be decided on its own facts\u2026. In the end, it will be the \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cin relation to\u201d test that will determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether a related transaction was completed in contemplation of a series of transactions.\n[47] In the case at hand, whether looking at it from a prospective or retrospective manner, it is clear that it is only \u201cbecause of\u201d the CCAA transactions in preserving the tax attributes of Biomerge and placing it in inventory for future sale that Total was able to acquire the tax attributes and it is only \u201cbecause of\u201d these transactions and events that Biomerge was able to sell them on the open market.\n[48] Consequently, I find all the CCAA transactions are part of the Total Conversion common law series in their entirety pursuant to s.248(10). Since the Tax Benefit occurred within the Total Conversion series it also occurred within the expanded series.\n(3) Primary Purpose of Avoidance Transactions [49] As earlier indicated, s.245(3) defines an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d as a transaction that results in a tax benefit, either by itself or as part of a series of transactions, \u201cunless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit.\u201d\n[50] The Minister assumed that the transactions between Xillix and Cavalon, including the initial letter agreements, the January 3, 2007 Letter Agreement accepted by Xillix, the Investment Agreement of Cavalon dated July 9, 2007, as amended and the completion of the transactions pursuant to the Restructuring Plan described in the earlier overview of this decision, was to monetize and ultimately sell the tax attributes of Xillix. The evidence overwhelmingly supports this. Reference to the desire to do so is found in the reports of Mr. Vermette, the PWC monitor and then Receiver appointed for Xillix. The affidavits of Mr. Gannon, the CEO of Xillix during the CCAA proceedings before his death speak to Cavalon\u2019s interest in acquiring Xillix\u2019s tax losses and refer to Cavalon as the \u201cTax Purchaser\u201d. The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that Cavalon was in the business of acquiring failed companies and marketing and selling their attributes, including tax attributes.\n[51] Moreover the Restructuring Plan approved steps that were carried to completion that had only a tax purpose, which include:\n(1) Xillix\u2019s articles were amended to create an unlimited number of non\u2011voting shares with the same economic attributes as the voting common shares, in that they both participated equally as to dividends and rights on distributions but were clearly needed to allow Nexia to convert most of its debenture in a manner to avoid obtaining de jure control. As stated earlier, after the debenture conversion, Nexia ended up with 45% of the voting shares, 100% of the non-voting common shares and 80% of the equity interest in Xillix. Mr. Tonken acknowledged the need to avoid a change in control. Clearly, as in the case of Madison Pacific Properties Inc. V Canada 2023 TCC 180 (\u201cMP Properties\u201d), the logical conclusion is that the creation and issuance of these non-voting shares was to avoid Nexia obtaining de jure control and hence preserve the losses.\n(2) At the request of Cavalon, the initial Investment Agreement and Restructuring plan was amended to remove the convertibility feature in the non-voting common shares into common shares to avoid those shares being treated as voting shares under s.256(8) of the Act and thus avoid de jure control. This event had only a tax purpose.\n[52] In analysing the CCAA transactions it is absolutely clear that the entire purpose of most of the transactions therein was to preserve and monetize the Biomerge tax attributes. Practically speaking, what else do you do with an entity that was an empty shell that had ceased carrying on business and no longer even had a place from which to conduct business with no assets other than its tax attributes and reporting issuer status with registration on the NEX exchange, a small subboard of TSX Ventures? The only evidence of the latter was from Mr. Tonken who testified that a clean public company with reporting issuer status and exchange registration would be worth about $250,000. There was no mention of whether the lower status of the NEX exchange would affect this, but it is clear the primary remaining assets were the $75 million plus level of tax attributes at that time.\n[53] I also agree with the Respondent\u2019s argument that the onus was on the Appellant to show the CCAA transactions had primarily a non-tax purpose and it neither pleaded any material facts in this regard nor made any argument to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption in this regard other than to suggest in argument that the primary purpose of the transactions to complete the \u201ccleansing\u201d portion of the CCAA transactions was to eliminate Biomerge\u2019s liabilities and preserve it as an ongoing concern; totally ignored the remaining transactions that I have found to be avoidance transactions, instead focusing only on the Total Conversion transactions.\n[54] While it is not necessary for me to consider whether any of the Total Conversion transactions would be an avoidance transaction due to the requirement that only one of the transactions in the expanded series of transactions had to be primarily for a non-tax purpose, I believe it would be appropriate to address the arguments of the parties in this regard.\n[55] In essence, the Appellant argues that the Total Conversion transactions were undertaken solely to effect the conversion of the Trust to a corporation to avoid the tax consequences of the SIFT rules earlier discussed and that the tax benefit from the Biomerge attributes were just \u201cgravy\u201d as Mr. Halyk testified. Moreover argues the Appellant, the selection of Biomerge as the conversion candidate is a \u201cchoice\u201d not an avoidance transaction, relying on Spruce Credit Union v. the Queen 2012 TCC 357, confirmed by the FCA 2014 FCA 143 [Spruce].\n[56] That case involved the determination by the Tax Court whether a dividend paid by an entity known as STAB to its members, which consisted of all BC credit unions who are required by law to be members and shareholders thereof, for the purpose of putting them in funds to pay an extraordinary assessment issued by the entity known as CUDIC attracted the GAAR. The Minister took the position that the dividend should be re-characterized as a refund of premiums paid and thus be taxable treating the dividend as an abusive avoidance transaction. STAB was the central credit union under BC legislation that is designated the stabilization authority for and required to supervise credit unions in BC. STAB is itself funded by contributions from credit unions as member premiums. CUDIC was the entity that in BC is required to maintain a deposit insurance fund to protect consumers against losses on their deposits funded by assessments against credit unions which occurred here to satisfy the higher fund thresholds resulting from legislative changes.\n[57] The Court decided this single transaction was not an avoidance transaction and had a clear non-tax purpose. Stab was clearly exercising its duty to stabilize it credit union members and whether the amounts to do so were a dividend or refund the amount of its payment would have been the same.\n[58] At paragraphs 91 to 93 of Spruce, Boyle J. stated:\n[91] In this case, the overall transaction of STAB paying dividend amounts to its member credit unions was clearly done for the purpose of putting the member credit unions in funds to pay the CUDIC assessments and reducing STAB\u2019s deposit protection and stabilization funds to the lesser required level following CUDIC\u2019s extraordinary assessment. This is clearly a bona fide non-tax purpose. An \u201coverall non-tax objective of transferring funds from STAB to CUDIC \u201cis admitted by the Respondent.\n[92] Unlike in Copthorne, in this case no step was inserted or undertaken primarily for the purpose of being able to obtain a desired or preferred tax result.\n[93] The act of choosing or deciding between or among alternative available transactions or structures to accomplish a non-tax purpose, based in whole or in part upon differing tax results of each, is not a transaction. Making a decision cannot be an avoidance transaction.\n[59] This was not a series of transaction case as the Respondent has pointed out in argument and in Spruce only the dividend transaction was in issue and no extra steps were involved. Indeed at paragraph 101 of Spruce, the Court stated:\n[101] overall, I am unable to identify any step or transaction undertaken other than for a primary non-tax purpose. This is in contrast with, for example, Copthorne, where the Appellant had to convert its pre-existing parent subsidiary structure to a sister company structure as a preliminary or intervening separate step in order to position itself to obtain the tax benefit sought. In this case there was no such step or transaction done primarily for that purpose.\n[60] The Appellant did not elaborate further on this issue in argument other than to conclude a choice is not a transaction and so the selection of Biomerge itself cannot be an avoidance transaction. Implied in the Appellant\u2019s position is of course, the Duke of Westminster principle and the ability of taxpayers to make business decisions that result in most favourable tax consequences to them and a caution against interfering with commercial decisions. The Appellant however has staged this argument in the context of arguing there was no primarily tax reasons for any of the Total Trust Conversion transactions.\n[61] Here I believe there is ample evidence to justify the Respondent\u2019s position that the primary purpose of the Conversion Transactions, including the choice of Biomerge, were primarily for a tax purpose and that there are steps or transactions undertaken for a primary a tax purpose.\n[62] Indeed at paragraph 60 of the FCA decision in Spruce, the Court specifically stated that the existence of an alternative transaction is a factor that can be considered even though a comparison between transactions accomplishing equivalent results other than tax is not itself sufficient to establish an avoidance transaction, otherwise the existence of alternative transactions with greater tax consequences would render the Duke of Westminster principle meaningless.\n[63] In paragraph 61, the Federal Court of Appeal went on to acknowledge that the \u201cneed to determine the \u2018primary\u2019 purpose implies that multiple purposes can coexist and that both tax and non-tax purposes can be intertwined.\u201d And in paragraph 62, the Court, relying on the Supreme Court decision in Canada Trustco, stated that \u201cwhere there is an avoidance transaction a Tax Court judge must consider and weigh all the evidence to determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that the transaction was not undertaken or arranged primarily for a non\u2011tax purpose.\u201d\n[64] Accordingly, it is clear that simply saying that a choice is not a transaction and thus not an avoidance transaction is simply not always true and will depend on all the evidence to be weighed.\n[65] In the case at hand, I find that there is overwhelming evidence to support the Respondent\u2019s position that the Total Conversion series as a whole and individual transactions within that series were undertaken primarily for tax purposes \u2013 to access the Biomerge tax attributes in a manner that avoided the application of s.111(5) of the Act. Such evidence includes the following:\n(1) Notwithstanding Mr. Halyk\u2019s testimony that all options were considered and analysed before deciding on selecting Biomerge as the conversion candidate, it is clear from the testimony of Mark Kearl, the CFO, that he was instructed only to consider targets with tax loss attributes and only interviewed this type of candidate.\n(2) The notes of Mr. Kearl put in evidence demonstrate the willingness of the Appellant to \u201cwalk\u201d from the deal if there was not a sufficient level of tax attributes that would make it \u201cworth our while\u201d and in fact the Arrangement Agreement was conditional upon there being a minimum of $70 million in such usable tax attributes.\n(3) The $3.9 million price or total consideration to be given to the Biomerge shareholders was calculated on a price of $0.052 per dollar of the non\u2011capital loss and SR&ED deduction tax attributes available only.\n(4) There is overwhelming evidence the Appellant conducted serious due diligence to confirm the existence, quantity and use of the tax attributes, through independent accountants and their own solicitors. The evidence is that the total closing costs of the transaction, excluding the $3.9 million above, including accounting and legal fees was approximately $900,000.00, a significant amount evidencing their focus on the tax attributes. The volume of due diligence evidence focusing on the tax attributes was huge.\n(5) There was no price allocated to Biomerge\u2019s reporting issuer status and public exchange registration which renders the suggestion that the primary purpose of the transaction was to use a cleansed corporation having such status not credible.\n(6) The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that the cost of acquiring a clean corporation with such issuer status was about $250,000. It begs the question why such a conversion candidate was not pursued or why it did not simply incorporate a new corporation as these options would have accomplished their non-tax purpose if that was the primary purpose.\n(7) There was no evidence given by the Appellant as to why they needed to acquire a public corporation with issuer status when Total already possessed issuer status in the larger provinces and substituted its own public listing status for the new entity resulting from the series, (namely the Appellant), rather than that of Biomerge. There was also no evidence of what value or use they made or would have made of any such Biomerge issuer status. Total was already registered on the more valuable TSX while Biomerge was registered on the lower NEX and no evidence was given to suggest it could not have substituted that TSX registration into a new corporation or other target at less cost.\n(8) Although the Appellant\u2019s concerns with respect to the SIFT rules and the choice to convert Total Trust to a corporation were business reasons, there is no evidence of any urgency to do so out of Mr. Halyk\u2019s stated fear that \u201cthe normal growth\u201d guidelines in those rules would hinder growth. There was no evidence of an acquisition or acquisitions in the works or contemplated that could lead to equity issuances of $50 million in any given year or the doubling of its market capitalization from October 1, 2006, the start of the CCAA transactions to 2010, when the Total Conversion transactions were completed. That would have exposed the Appellant to the consequences of the SIFT distribution tax at an earlier stage than 2011. Frankly, if there was any such concern, it begs the question as to why the Appellant would not have simply bought a public shell company or incorporated a new one earlier.\n[66] Although the above should be sufficient to demonstrate the overall avoidance character of the series in question, it should be noted that unlike Spruce Credit relied upon by the Appellant above, there were indeed steps inserted into an otherwise commercial transaction that I agree were avoidance transactions. These include the step to cash out the Biomerge non-voting shares and the partial cash\u2011out of the voting shares which were exchanged for part-cash and shares in New Total which clearly served to eliminate the bulk of the interest held by the original shareholders of Biomerge, including most of the majority interest indirectly held by Tonken and Mathews through Nexia. This was not just an exchange of shares and trust units but a cash out of most of the prior shareholders\u2019 interest in Biomerge such that they only held 0.2% of the equity interest in New Total while the Total unit holders ended up with 99.8%.\n[67] It is clear that concerns about the application of the SIFT Rules in 2011 were secondary to the primary purpose of this Total Conversion series: the buying and selling of tax attributes.\n[68] As earlier mentioned, the sole purpose of the additional step of creating a new class of non-voting shares by Xillix to issue to Nexia, within the expanded series, was to transfer most of the equity interest in Xillix to Nexia in a manner that avoided Nexia acquiring de jure control. Nexia ended up with 80% of the equity in the publically traded Xillix while at the same time acquiring a large block of voting common shares - 45%-in an otherwise large and disparate body of shareholders, none of whom then controlled Xillix.\n[69] I find that the second condition required for GAAR has been satisfied and will now consider the third condition.\nAbusive Tax Avoidance: Whether the transactions giving rise to the tax benefit were abusive.\n[70] As stated in Deans Knight Income Corp v Canada, 2023 SCC 16 (\u201cDeans Knight\u201d) at paragraph 56, relying on Canada Trustco and Copthorne:\n[56] The third step of the GAAR analysis is frequently the most contentious\u2026 Analyzing whether the transactions are abusive involves first, determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provision and, second, determine whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose\u2026 (emphasis mine)\n[71] As set out in Copthorne, at paragraph 72, abusive tax avoidance exists \u201c(1) where the transaction achieves an outcome the statutory provision was intended to prevent; (2) where the transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provision; or (3) where the transaction circumvents the provisions in a manner that frustrates or defeats its object, spirit or purpose\u201d and these are often intertwined.\n[72] The Respondent takes the position that the transactions were an abuse of s.111(5) dealing with non-capital losses, s.111(4) which parallels s.111(5) for net capital losses, s.37(6.1) which effectively parallels s.111(5) with respect to SR&ED deductions as well as an abuse of the SIFT conversion rules in s.85.1(8) and s.88.1(2) which are the provisions particular to the facts of this case.\n[73] The Appellant takes the position that if the Court determined that the relevant series as expanded included the CCAA transactions, then this case is distinguishable from Deans Knight, for reasons I will address later, that result in no abuse of s.111(5), s.111(4) and s.37(6.1) and there was no policy of the Act at the relevant time that restricted the choice of corporations utilized in carrying out the trust conversion under s.85.1(8) nor was there any general policy at the relevant time that restricted the ability to utilize the tax attributes of a conversion candidate under s.85.1(7) and (8) and 88.1(2) and hence no abuse of the SIFT conversion rules.\n[74] I will first address the purported abuse of s.111(5) and parallel provisions and then that of the SIFT conversion rules.\ns.111(5)and parallel provisions\n[75] While I will restrict my analysis to paragraph 111(5) of the Act, the same will apply to the parallel provisions dealing with net capital losses and SR&ED deductions.\n[76] The first step of the abuse analysis requires determining what the object, spirit and purpose of the provision is.\n[77] There is no need to conduct a detailed analysis to determine the object, spirit and purpose ( the \u201cOSP\u201d) of s.111(5) as the SCC explicitly set this out in their recent decision in Deans Knight at paragraph 113:\n[113]\u2026the object, spirit and purpose of s.111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporation\u2019s identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non-capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s.111(5).\n[78] And at paragraph 118, \u201cIn this case, s.111(5) demonstrates Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business.\u201d\n[79] The second step of the abuse analyses requires me to determine whether the result of the transactions frustrates that OSP.\n[80] I have rendered the word \u201cresult\u201d in bold to make a point. The Appellant has essentially argued in oral and written argument that the SCC test in Deans Knight is not only a \u201cresults\u201d test. In analysing the decisions in Deans Knight, The King V MMV Corporate Partners Inc., 2023 FCA 234 (\u201cMMV\u201d) and MP Properties the Appellant essentially argues that the factual analysis to be undertaken by the Court should mainly focus on determining whether the rights and benefits of the original shareholders were affected in such a manner as to result in \u201cthe functional equivalent of de jure control\u201d and concludes this did not happen as a result of the CCAA transactions. The Appellant appears to be elevating only one aspect of the \u201chow\u201d the Court in Deans Knight arrived at its conclusion, using factors that impacted the rights and benefits of the original shareholders, i.e. rendering their majority vote or de jure control meaningless via a contract to essentially shift the reins to different person, to a subtest within the results test. Nevertheless it couches it in terms so as to suggest that we should treat the factors that achieve this functional equivalency of control, or fail to, as the \u201capproach\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d the Court is directed to follow as the factor to focus on.\n[81] Indeed in paragraphs 215 and 216 of its written submissions, the Appellant argues:\n215. The Respondent will attempt to suggest that the Court should simply compare the results of the series of transactions in issue against the underlying rationale of the Loss Streaming Rules to find abusive tax avoidance, relying upon statements in the recent decisions of MMV and MP Properties in support.\n216. Taking the Respondent\u2019s position to its logical conclusion, the Respondent would be asserting that MMV or MP Properties stand for the proposition that the Respondent is not required to establish, as a question of fact before this Court, the existence of the functional equivalent of an acquisition of de jure control or the existence of other hallmarks of control to find an abuse of the Loss Streaming Rules. Such a position is flawed and not supported by a careful review of Deans Knight, MMV and MP Properties. It is also inconsistent with the Respondent\u2019s burden of proof under the abuse portion of the GAAR analyses.\n[82] Deans Knight was clear that the requirement for finding misuse and abuse is a question of fact that requires consideration of the circumstances as a whole to see if they achieved the outcome Parliament sought to prevent [see par 121 and 122]. In paragraph 122 the Court stated that:\n[122]\u2026the abuse analysis is comparative: it asks courts to assess the transactions at issue in light of the provisions rationale to determine whether the results achieved by the transactions frustrates this rationale...\n[83] It follows that all circumstances must be considered in the context of each case. Deans Knight, MVV, and MP Properties all used this approach. There are no circumstances or facts that must be specifically included or ignored and the Court must determine what weight to give each of them and as a whole in deciding whether the results achieved frustrate the rationale of the provision. It follows that an analysis of any control circumstances is not the only analysis that is relevant, and Deans Knight, MVV and MP Properties all considered a multitude of often differing circumstances.\n[84] What is clear from the wording the SCC used in enunciating the rationale of s.111(5), however, is that the focus is to determine the \u201cresults\u201d of the transactions: whether they achieved an outcome Parliament sought to prevent, and so the Appellant is incorrect in its position above suggesting such is flawed.\n[85] Graham J. in MP Properties at paragraphs 145 to 183, analysed asset changes to the target company, the lack of employees, changes in share structure, changes in the business character (including name change), fundamental changes in shareholdings and board of directors, and whether there was a significant shift in control of the target corporation that initially had the subject losses, as well as who controlled the series of transactions to conclude that the series of transactions fundamentally transformed the Appellant and in doing so frustrated the rationale of s.111(4). Deans Knight also considered factors that determined whether the target corporation had been fundamentally transformed and what shareholder rights and benefits had been obtained by the company who affected the series of transactions including the impact of an agreement that restricted the normal rights of shareholders whether specifically or otherwise.\n[86] The analysis the Court will focus on, adopting the approach of Graham J in MP Properties, will be on comparing the results of the series of transactions in this case and not on comparing its series of transactions to the series of transactions in Deans Knight [see par 141], the approach confirmed by the FCA in MVV [see par 144 of MP].\nResults Analysis\nThe series of transactions evidence the following:\n(1) Changed Business Activity\n[87] Xillix was in the business of medical imaging. This business ceased to operate as the assets of this business were sold off to satisfy its creditors, some during receivership as contemplated in the Plan of Restructuring that occurred during the CCAA transactions. No employees remained other than Messrs. Tonken and Matthews who inserted themselves into management and the leased premises where Xillix had conducted its business was also abandoned such that Xillix became an insolvent shell of a company having only its tax attributes and corporate existence as a public corporation that were marketed for sale.\n[88] Once the Total Conversion series was completed, particularly through the amalgamation of TESL, the main operating subsidiary of the Total group, with Biomerge (then New Total) the business of Total was inserted into Biomerge; namely the business of oil drilling services and equipment for the oil exploration industry described earlier; a completely new and different business.\n(2) Change in Assets and Existing Liabilities\n[89] Not only was there a total change from the type of business Biomerge (originally Xillix) had carried on but there was an insertion of valuable assets as well as the existing liabilities of TESL into Biomerge. Only the tax attributes of Biomerge were utilized by the new entity as even its public reporting issuer status on the NEX was not utilized by the new entity which substituted the Total TSX registration into it.\n(3) Changed Name\n[90] The name of the business was changed several times during the series, from Xillix to Biomerge and eventually to the name of the Appellant.\n(4) Change in Share Structure\n[91] The share structure of Xillix was also substantially changed from voting common shares publicly traded to the introduction of non-voting common shares with the same participation in dividends and distribution on wind\u2011up as the original voting shares but which were issued to Nexia pursuant to the conversion of debt to equity under the Debenture described in the CCAA series for the admitted reason of avoiding an acquisition of de jure control by Nexia to preserve the tax attributes of Xillix.\n[92] The share structure changed again when Biomerge, a BC based corporation, filed articles of continuance in Alberta, where a new class of voting shares displaced the previous share structure of Biomerge to set up the reverse takeover by an exchange transaction utilized to convert Total\u2019s trust units to these new shares of Biomerge.\n(5) Change in Ownership\n[93] There was a near total change, no pun intended, in the ownership of Biomerge. Xillix started off as a widely held public corporation that after insolvency and restructuring transactions, including the issuance of non\u2011voting shares, ended up with an ownership structure that saw 80% of its equity interest owned by a new shareholder, Nexia, who acquired 45% of the voting common shares and 100% of the non-voting shares to avoid de jure control acquisition. Frankly, it is quite clear that had the tax benefit been utilized by Nexia at that time the Minister would have applied GAAR then and I am satisfied would have been successful.\n[94] Share ownership of course changed again after the exchange transaction referred to in the Total Conversion series where the Total trust unit holders ended up with 99.8% of the voting common shares and equity in the resulting Appellant\u2019s existence.\n[95] The ownership result above referenced was mostly due to the fact that part of the transactions included all the non-voting common shares of Biomerge held by Nexia being cashed out as well as the cash consideration given to the voting common shareholders of Biomerge which included Nexia resulting in most of the value of such voting shares being cashed out. It should be noted that any voting shareholder of Biomerge holding less than a block of shares of 4,219 shares were cashed out in full as well.\n[96] Since the original shareholders of Xillix owned 55% of the common shares thereof, it appears certain that the equity interest of those original shareholders was about .1% of the Appellant, but of course the evidence is that this interest was cashed out in later steps.\n(6) Use of the Attributes\n[97] The Appellant, as the successor to Xillix, claimed its tax losses and SR&ED deductions in 2010 and 2011 for the benefit of the almost entirely new and unrelated shareholders of the Appellant.\n(7) Shift in Control\n[98] There was a significant shift in control throughout the expanded series. The evidence is that Xillix\u2019s publicly traded shares were held by a wide and disparate group of shareholders such that no one person or group of persons appears to have held de jure control. Xillix had a board of directors and slate of officers who continued in those roles when Xillix sought and was given creditor protection under the Alberta CCAA until the President of Xillix died before it could complete a restructuring, leading to Xillix being placed into Receivership that triggered the resignation of the remaining slate of officers and directors. While the Receiver held the reins of Xillix under the terms of receivership and thus can be argued to have had the temporary functional equivalence of control under those terms which the Appellant seemed to acknowledge in argument, it would be a stretch to find the terms of receivership and the receivers statutory and fiduciary duties as an avoidance transaction although factually speaking it does demonstrate a lack of continuity of Xillix.\n[99] Notwithstanding the fact they stepped into the roles of officers and directors during the receivership, to ensure the agreed plan of restructuring could proceed under the Investment Agreement and to facilitate those transactions as signing authorities, Mr. Tonken and Mathews and their friendly nominees, Mr. Forrester and Kirkham, were entitled to become and became the new directors and officers of Xillix pursuant to the terms of the Investment agreement; which required the old ones to resign and gave Nexia the right to appoint new officers and directors.\n[100] In my view Nexia acquired the necessary level of control, whether one calls it the functional equivalence of control, de facto control or otherwise, in the following ways:\n(i) It had the contractual right to appoint the officers and directors of Xillix pursuant to the Investment Agreement which, together with the Plan of Restructuring, obligated it to sell the remaining assets of Xillix for the benefit of its shareholders. (ii) I do not agree with the Appellant\u2019s position that the Investment Agreement was terminated once the Restructuring plan was completed and the duties of the receiver ended. Xillix, under amended terms of the Agreement and Restructuring plan, avoided bankruptcy and continued as an entity and was bound by the terms thereof to complete a sale to find value for its shareholders. (iii) Although the original shareholders still held 55% of the voting shares in Xillix, later renamed, such that Nexia did not have de jure control, it is clear they had by economic necessity and an unwritten agreement, agreed to allow Nexia to take the reigns of actual control to finish the transactions that would enable them to realize something on their initial investment. As Mr. Tonken testified, they would have got nothing if they did not go along with the Investment Agreement that immersed Messrs. Tonken and Mathews via Nexia into the mix with an injection of funds that paid off remaining creditors and cleansed the corporation for sale of its tax attributes. It is also clear they did go along as the Nexia slate of officers and directors were not at any time removed until the series of transactions were near an end to make way for the nominees of Total. It was Nexia, through the efforts of Tonken and Matthews, who completed the one stated goal of the Restructuring plan, namely, to realize value for the shareholders through the sale of Xillix\u2019s tax attributes that was of economic importance to such shareholders. (iv) The fact that the BC Supreme Court did not require the approval of the original shareholders of Nexia to approve the plan of restructuring is clear evidence those original shareholders had diminished rights by their loss from economic circumstances. [101] Given the above circumstances, there was zero chance the original shareholders of Xillix would exercise any voting rights to remove a board of directors who had a contractual obligation to realize value from the tax attributes as well as a fiduciary one in their legal requirement to act in the best interest of those shareholders. They went along under economic necessity and were rewarded when their interests were cashed out later. As Tonken alluded to in testimony, they had no choice.\n(8) Control of Transactions\n[102] Having regard to my finding that Nexia had the necessary level of control of Xillix from my comments above, it follows that Nexia had complete control of the transactions in its capacity as the Seller of Biomerge tax attributes.\n[103] On the other hand, it is clear to me that Total had complete control of the transactions found in the Total Conversion series as the Buyer of Biomerge tax attributes and, in my opinion, took overall control of the series from Nexia at this point. It is clear that Nexia loaned Xillix $4.4 million dollars pursuant to its convertible Debenture loan earlier reference based $0.55 for each dollar of tax attributes. Nexia and Total negotiated a price of $0.52 per dollar of those available tax attributes and the evidence showed Nexia would be losing money overall. It is also clear Nexia had borrowed funds on the security of its assets to enable it to make the Debenture loan, which borrowed funds bore an 11% interest rate at the time and was anxious to complete the deal with Total to obtain the liquidity to pay off the borrowed funds and get the shares in Nexia released from escrow, a term of the Nexia\u2019s purchase of Cavalon\u2019s shares from Tonken (spouse) and Mathews in which the purchase price was paid by the issuance of Nexia shares to them.\n[104] As mentioned above, most of the value of the shares Nexia owned in Xillix was paid in cash either through the purchase for cancellation of 100% of the non\u2011voting shares or the bulk of the consideration for those voting shares exchanged for cash and shares in New Total. It was a condition of the Nexia\/Total Agreement that Nexia enter into a Support Agreement to vote its shares in support of the Arrangement Agreement all but making it certain that the vote of the security holders of Xillix required to approve the deal with Total, which required a 2\/3 majority vote of the total voting and non-voting shareholders of Biomerge voting together as a single class, would be assured given that Nexia had 80% of such securities and hence could deliver an 80% vote.\n[105] Given the obvious necessity for Nexia to complete this deal and the fact it contracted to deliver the deal to Total, which would result in the Total unit holders ending up with almost all the issued securities in New Total - 99.8%, as well as require the nominees of Nexia to resign as officers and directors of Biomerge, suggests to me Total took over control of the series of transactions once the Arrangement Agreement was entered into.\n[106] The Appellant\u2019s argument that the deal was still not a certainty since it was also conditional upon no more than 5% of the shareholders of either side dissenting, is simply not credible in the circumstances. As I mentioned earlier, the original shareholders of Xillix went along out of economic necessity with the Restructuring plan as their only hope to realize some value for their investment. Nexia clearly committed to supporting the deal. The likelihood that such original shareholders of Biomerge would scuttle their only hope for some sort of payout is not only highly unlikely but would be inconsistent with their conduct to date. In fact, the evidence is that only 1.6% of the non-Nexia shareholders even cast a vote so the Appellant\u2019s concerns were not only extremely remote but did not materialize.\n[107] Moreover, to address the elephant in the room, it is clear to me that Total had the necessary level of control, in any event, upon entering into the Arrangement Agreement with Nexia as such agreement by it own terms severely restricted the rights of Biomerge shareholders. In subparagraphs 3.2(r) and (s) of that agreement, and in other provisions, Biomerge covenanted not to directly or indirectly permit a number of actions normally requiring the approval of directors and shareholders of a corporation such as making any dividend distribution, amending its constating documents, issuing, pledging, or redeeming any of its shares, reorganizing or liquidating, selling or encumbering any of its assets, acquiring any assets or liabilities and so forth; such that the shareholders and directors of Biomerge were prevented from doing essentially anything that would change it to something other than a shell of a company having tax attributes.\n[108] Frankly, in the real world no board of directors or officers of a corporation would risk a finding of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties to its shareholders by agreeing to place the profitable business and assets of their corporation into hands and control of an insolvent company. Notwithstanding the ethereal arguments the Courts seem to hear in these type of cases, the terms of agreement between such parties ensure that the Buyer retains \u201ccontrol\u201d, regardless of what nomenclature is given to such term - being de jure, de factor, actual, necessary level of or the functional equivalence of control - to achieve the results of acquiring the tax attributes. Nexia and Total here had all the control they needed to complete their respective transactions.\n[109] At this point I would like to address the Appellant\u2019s arguments that suggest this case is distinguishable from Deans Knight because none of the Biomerge shares were purchased or acquired and because the result of new shareholders owning 99.8% of New Total was the result of the permitted exchange method in s.85.1(8) of the Act (one of the two methods Parliament enacted to permit the conversion of Income Trusts to corporations under the SIFT rules) that resulted in the dilution of the original Biomerge equity interest to the 0.2% level. Fair value was given on the exchange.\n[110] In Deans Knight, the reduction in the original shareholders equity interest was diluted only by using the mechanism of an Initial Public Offering. I see no difference in the result. As the SCC determined in expressing the rationale of s.111(5), the results of the transactions are the focus, not the mechanics that achieved them. In any event, as my colleague pointed out in MP Properties at paragraph 142:\n[142]\u2026the series of transactions in Deans Knight is not the only way that loss trading can be abusive. As I mentioned before, each case must be decided on its own facts.\n[111] Here, like in Deans Knight and MP Properties, the only link between Xillix, prior to the series of transactions, and the Appellant after them, were the tax attributes in issue. The impugned transactions resulted in a total transformation of Xillix \u2013a complete lack of the continuity of its identity- while imbuing a new entity with new shareholders to benefit from its tax attributes \u2013 a result completely contrary to spirit, object and purpose of each of s.111(5) in respect of non-capital losses, s.111(4) in respect of net-capital losses and s.37(6.1) in respect of SR&ED deductions. The Minister was therefore correct in denying the Appellant the losses and deductions in issue in this appeal using the GAAR.\n[112] Looking back at the bird\u2019s eye view of the transactions I referenced at the beginning of this decision, the reality of what happened here is that a willing seller in the business of selling tax attributes of failed companies takes the reins of such a company and markets and sells them to a willing unrelated buyer for use against their income. If these are not the type of transactions Parliament sought to stop by the enactment of the loss streaming rules in s.111(5) and parallel provisions, I don\u2019t know what are. The results speak for themselves.\nAbuse of SIFT Rules\n[113] Having regard to my findings above, it is not necessary for me to determine whether there was an abusive avoidance of the SIFT rules but I would like to comment on some of the arguments and issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s arguments.\n[114] I would like to address the argument of the Appellant at paragraph 173 of its written submissions that there is no policy in the SIFT rules \u201cplacing restrictions on the utilization of corporate tax attributes following a SIFT conversion\u201d and at paragraph 177 where the Appellant suggests that while \u201cthere were detailed rules in subsection 111(5) that dealt with the streaming of losses for corporations there were no such rules or evident policy related to the streaming of losses of trusts\u201d. The context of these arguments is that the Appellant assumed only the Trust Conversion series were relevant to this case, which I disagreed with. However, in paragraph 225 of its argument in the context of assuming the CCAA transaction were included in the relevant series, the Appellant suggests there was no abuse of the loss streaming rules since \u201cTotal did not use the share structure of Biomerge that was put in place under Nexia\u2019s investment in Biomerge\u2026 did not purchase Nexia\u2019s shares of Biomerge\u2026 instead exchanged their trust units for shares in Biomerge with s.85.1(8), diluting the interest of the Predecessor Biomerge Shareholders in Biomerge down in a manner reflective of relative fair market value.\u201d; to suggest \u201cthere can be no factual abuse of the Loss Streaming Rules if the purported avoidance transaction undertaken by Total is not used in the manner contemplated\u201d.\n[115] To the extent the Appellant infers that the use of the conversion rules cannot be an avoidance transaction because the use of those rules may not have abused the purpose of those specific rules, he would be incorrect in my view for a few reasons.\n[116] Firstly, this case cannot be properly characterized as a loss streaming of trusts case. The tax benefit was used by the Appellant, a corporation and hence is subject to the corporate loss streaming rules of s.111(5) of the Act and parallel provisions. In any event, the losses in issue here were not losses of the Trust that were streamed, they were of Xillix via Nexia.\n[117] Secondly, the conversion of the Trust to the corporation of New Total pursuant to s.85.1(7) and (8) and s.88.1(2) of the Act, resulted in the corporation owning the shares of TESL hence creating a parent-subsidiary relationship. It was the subsidiary that operated the main businesses of the group and had the profits against which the losses and deductions in issue were later claimed. New Total itself was essentially Biomerge rebadged with new shareholders but no active business or business assets as a result. It was only the next step in the series, that of amalgamating New Total and TESL to create the Appellant, that inserted the new business and substantial business assets, operations and profits into the mix. There is no evidence New Total could have used the tax attributes at the conversion stage. This was a series of transactions as determined by me earlier, not a single trust to corporate conversion transaction under the SIFT rules.\n[118] Thirdly, such a position would ignore the reach and purpose of GAAR itself. The use of a provision as per one or more of its intended purposes does not mean such use could not be considered an avoidance transaction that abused the rationale of another provision like s.111(5); particularly when the rationale of such provision reflects the foundational principles of Act described in detail in Deans Knight [See paras.84-85] to deny trading in losses between unrelated parties.\n[119] The Conversion Transactions forming part of the relevant series of transactions is part of the whole transactions the Court must consider. Even if the actual Conversion Transactions using the SIFT rules exchange method were found not to be avoidance transactions, which I disagree with in this instance, the remaining avoidance transactions are an abuse of s.111(5). As stated earlier, the Court need only find that one of the transactions in the series was an avoidance transaction. Having found an abuse of s.111(5), the fact there may or may not be an abuse of the SIFT rules does not detract from this finding.\n[120] Fourthly, it must be made clear that technical compliance with any provision of the Act does not serve to prohibit a finding of abusive tax avoidance.\n[121] The SCC in Deans Knight, relying on Copthorne, at paragraphs 71 and 72 stated:\n[71]\u2026 the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s.245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules are among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions\u2026\n[72] This Court in Copthorne largely rejected the argument that where Parliament had drafted detailed provisions, then a taxpayer that has technically complied with these provisions cannot frustrate their rationale (paras.108-11). Simply put, specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse. As with any other provision, GAAR ensures that the rationale behind such provision is not frustrated by abusive tax strategies. (emphasis mine).\n[122] Clearly, if technical compliance with specific anti-avoidance rules cannot circumvent the application of GAAR then neither can technical compliance with other provisions.\n[123] Fifthly, and in any event, I disagree with the Appellant\u2019s assertion in paragraph 190 of its written argument, that \u201cthere was no clear and unambiguous policy restricting the use of a candidate\u2019s tax attributes on a SIFT conversion\u201d.\n[124] As the Respondent has pointed out, Parliament\u2019s stated policy in enacting the SIFT rules was to create a level playing field between income trusts and corporations by creating an additional level of tax at the Trust level. The use of s.85.1(7) and (8) and s.88.1(2) results in what is known as the exchange method Parliament sanctioned as one of the two methods to convert an income trust to a corporation on a tax deferred basis to avoid that new tax. More specifically s.85.1(8) effects a tax free rollover of the trust units to a corporation while the subsequent wind-up of the trust into the Corporation under s.88.1(2) effects the transfer of the Trusts assets and tax attributes to the corporation. To suggest it could be used to acquire the tax attributes of an existing corporation as part of a series of transactions containing avoidance transactions would mean that a corporation used as part of a trust conversion would have a tax advantage no other corporation would have if it acquired losses contrary to s.111(5) or parallel provisions and thus frustrate the goal of creating a \u201clevel playing field\u201d described above.\n[125] The Appellant\u2019s argument that since the wording of the above provisions did not prohibit the acquisition of the candidate corporation\u2019s tax attributes and that since s.256(7)(c) of the Act applies to corporations and not to income trusts in deeming acquisition of control to be acquired in a reverse takeover, then the absence of both such prohibiting language and of such a deeming rule in the context of income trusts must mean such an acquisition could not be an abusive transaction. The Appellant points to the fact it is only subsequent to the introduction of the SIFT rules that s.256(7)(c.1) was enacted applying the deeming of acquisition of control in a reverse takeover involving a trust and hence the absence of any such rule existing at the time of these transactions is further evidence it was not intended to be prohibited.\n[126] Frankly, the fact s.111 was not amended to exclude income trust conversion transactions can be equally argued to mean Parliament did not intend to exclude them. Moreover, as mentioned before, s.111(5) and any parallel provisions apply to a \u201ccorporation\u201d thus any conversion candidate would be caught by the clear wording of the provision. It was simply not necessary for Parliament to have addressed this in the SIFT Conversion rules. The fact it enacted s.256(7)(c.1) to apply the deeming rule to trust conversions serves to clarify the policy as well as provide automatic denial of such losses rather than resorting to the GAAR and thus creates greater certainty for taxpayers. Moreover, as the Respondent has pointed out, subsequent amendments to provisions do not mean the rationale of those provisions is changed [see Deans Knight at par 98] and the Supreme Court in Deans Knight had no difficulty in enunciating it\u2019s rationale for s.111(5) without stating any such exception.\n[127] I find no merit to the Appellant\u2019s arguments and would find that the Appellant\u2019s use of the exchange method in the facts of this case also resulted in an abuse of the rationale of the SIFT rules contrary to the GAAR.\nConclusion\n[128] The appeals are dismissed on the basis of the foregoing.\n[129] Costs are awarded to the Respondent. The parties shall have until March 4, 2024 to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the Respondent shall have a until April 4, 2024 to serve and file written submissions on costs and the Appellant shall have 30 days following the service of the Respondent\u2019s submissions above to file and serve a written response. Any such submission shall not exceed 10 pages in length. If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received within the foregoing limits, costs shall be awarded to the Respondent as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 2nd day of February 2024.\n\u201cF.J.

Spiro\nAppearances:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nLalitha Ramachandran\nAndrea Jackett\nJUDGMENT\nThe Respondent\u2019s motion to extend time to serve the Reply to February 4, 2021 is granted, without costs.\nThe Appellant\u2019s appeal is allowed, without costs. The redeterminations made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) on March 20, 2020, for the periods July 2015 to June 2016; July 2016 to June 2017; July 2017 to June 2018; July 2018 to June 2019; and July 2019 to June 2020 are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and redetermination on the basis that the Appellant is entitled to 50% of the Canada Child Benefit under subsection 122.61(1.1) of the Income Tax Act in respect of the following 33 months as he was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in respect of his two youngest children in those months: February 2016, March 2016, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 31st day of January 2024.\n\u201cDavid E. Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 13\nDate: 20240131\nDocket: 2020-1960(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nLUIGI GINO AUDDINO,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Gino Auddino, claims 50% of the Canada Child Benefit (the \u201cCCB\u201d) as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d from July 2015 to June 2020 under the provisions of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) disallowed the Appellant\u2019s claim by notices of redetermination dated March 20, 2020. The Appellant challenges those redeterminations.\n[2] The Court heard evidence on June 15, 2023 from the Appellant and his former spouse. Because the Appellant was self\u2011represented, and in light of the amount of evidence dealing with various parenting schedules over a period of five years, I asked the parties to submit written argument. The Court received written argument from the parties in July, September, and October 2023.\n[3] The Appellant has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying entitlement to 50% of the CCB as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for the following months: February 2016, March 2016, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\n[4] The Crown made a preliminary motion before the trial opened to extend the time for service of the Reply. For the following reasons, I granted the motion and proceeded to hear the appeal.\nCrown\u2019s Motion to Extend Time to Serve the Reply\n[5] Subsection 6(2) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (Informal Procedure) provides:\n6(2) Within five days after a reply is filed, the Minister of National Revenue shall serve a copy of it by registered mail addressed to the appellant\u2019s address for service of documents.\n[6] The Minister filed the Reply on January 18, 2021. The Minister was, therefore, required to serve the Reply on the Appellant on or before January 25, 2021. The Minister did not serve the Reply until February 4, 2021, some ten days late.\n[7] Before the hearing, the Appellant told Crown counsel that he planned to raise late service of the Reply as a preliminary issue at trial. In response, the Crown filed and served a motion to extend time to serve the Reply. The motion record included an affidavit from Ms. Elli (Yan) Song, a litigation officer at the Toronto Centre Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d).\n[8] On January 19, 2021, the Toronto Centre TSO, which drafted the Reply, sent it to the Sudbury Taxation Centre for mailing by registered mail. I do not know what happened at the Sudbury TC as the Crown offered no evidence from anyone who worked there at the time.\n[9] By way of background, the Court originally scheduled the Appellant\u2019s appeal for hearing on April 6, 2023. The Appellant requested, and the Court granted, an adjournment on the basis that he was required to attend a work\u2011related training program shortly before trial. He told the Court that he was concerned that he would not be able to prepare for the hearing in the short period between the end of the course and the commencement of the hearing. The important point for present purposes is that he expressed no concern about late service of the Reply.\n[10] In her cross-examination of the Appellant on the motion, Crown counsel, Ms. Ramachandran, established that the Appellant suffered no prejudice from the Minister\u2019s delay in serving the Reply in early 2021. Indeed, in requesting that I dismiss the Crown\u2019s motion, the Appellant did not allege any prejudice by the late service of the Reply. He simply argued that this was:\n\u2026 a case of [CRA] failing to do their due diligence and in getting the paperwork to me in the required amount of time.[1]\n[11] In the absence of any prejudice to the Appellant, I granted the Crown\u2019s motion to extend the time for service of the Reply to February 4, 2021.\nIssue\n[12] Few tasks are more frustrating than reading a pleading that does not clearly identify the issue. The Reply states that the issue is \u201cwhether the Minister has properly determined the Appellant\u2019s CCB entitlements\u201d from July 2015 to June 2016; July 2016 to June 2017; July 2017 to June 2018; July 2018 to June 2019; and July 2019 to June 2020. The issue was framed too broadly. Here, the real issue (often called the \u201cdeep issue\u201d) is whether the Appellant was a \u201cshared\u2011custody parent\u201d in respect of his two youngest children in each month from July 2015 to June 2020 and, in particular, whether he resided with the children at least 40% of the time in each of those months.[2]\n[13] No other condition for the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to 50% of the CCB for those 60 months was in issue.\nLaw\n[14] The CCB is a tax-free monthly payment to families to assist them financially in raising children under 18 years of age. A separate benefit is payable for each child. Payments occur over twelve months, beginning in July and ending the following year in June. The amount of the CCB is determined based on a parent\u2019s income, the number of children in respect of whom the benefit is claimed and the age of the children. The CCB phases out with increasing income levels, thereby targeting low and middle-income families.\n[15] The Appellant claims that he was an \u201celigible individual\u201d with respect to his youngest children from July 2015 to June 2020 because he and his former spouse were \u201cshared-custody parents\u201d.\n[16] \u201cShared-custody parent\u201d is defined in section 122.6 of the Act as (emphasis added):\n\u2026 an individual who is one of the two parents of the qualified dependant who\n(a) are not at that time cohabitating spouses or common-law partners of each other,\n(b) reside with the qualified dependant either\n(i) at least 40% of the time in the month in which the particular time occurs, or\n(ii) on an approximately equal basis, and\n(c) primarily fulfil the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant when residing with the qualified dependant, as determined in consideration of prescribed factors.\n[17] The only issue in his appeal is whether the Appellant satisfied the 40% test in the definition of \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each month in issue.\nFacts\n[18] The Appellant is a casino table games dealer. Until March 2020, he worked at a casino in Port Perry, Ontario. He then started work at a casino in Pickering, Ontario. His former spouse, Ms. Marianne Csikai, is employed as an executive assistant in the financial industry.\n[19] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai had three children together. The first was born in August 2003, the second was born in May 2006 and the third was born in September 2008. As the oldest child resided exclusively with Ms. Csikai, the two youngest children are the only ones relevant to the Appellant\u2019s claim as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d.\n[20] The Appellant testified that he and Ms. Csikai entered into a separation agreement on October 12, 2017.[3] That agreement provided an access and parenting schedule for the two youngest children.\n[21] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that their youngest children were at school from 8:45 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. and that, during the school year, the exchange of the children would happen at school pick up and drop off.\n[22] Before February 2016, the Appellant\u2019s work schedule did not permit him to host the children overnight.\nThe Various Schedules\n[23] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai presented various schedules during the hearing:\nRegular schedule as provided in the separation agreement;\nHoliday schedule as provided in the separation agreement;\nAppellant\u2019s actual schedule summarizing his evidence of how the schedules operated; and\nMs. Csikai\u2019s calendar summarizing her evidence of how the schedules operated.\nSchedule from February 1, 2016 to April 10, 2017\n[24] The Appellant testified that the regular schedule, as set out in the separation agreement, was in place as of February 1, 2016 when he was able to host the children overnight. The regular schedule, as described by the Appellant, operated on a two-week rotation:\nOn week one, the Appellant would have the children on the weekend from Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday school drop off and from Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off.\nOn week two, the Appellant would have the children from Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[25] The Appellant testified that in addition to the regular schedule, he had access to the children for Christmas, March Break, Thanksgiving, Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, and birthdays. In the separation agreement, this is described as the holiday schedule.\n[26] The Appellant presented an actual schedule, as he described it, which he prepared for the Court based on the actual combined workings of the regular schedule and the holiday schedule as set out in the separation agreement.\n[27] The actual schedule reflects a summary of the Appellant\u2019s evidence on how the schedules in the separation agreement actually operated. For example, to the extent that the regular schedule and the holiday schedule were inconsistent, the separation agreement provided that the holiday schedule would prevail and that is how it actually worked.\n[28] Ms. Csikai\u2019s evidence with respect to this period is generally consistent with the Appellant\u2019s evidence. In the course of her testimony, she presented a calendar that she prepared before trial to reflect the days that the children were with the Appellant.[4] This was her version of the actual schedule. She explained that as of June 2016 the Appellant was with the two youngest children on alternate weekends and at least one day, and sometimes two days, during the week.\n[29] She explained that in November and December 2016 there was no agreed schedule but she elected to follow the Appellant\u2019s preferred schedule. According to Ms. Csikai, at this time, the two youngest children were with the Appellant on alternate weekends and one day, sometimes two days, during the week.\n[30] Finally, she explained that from February 2017 to April 2017 there was no agreed schedule. The Appellant had the two youngest children one or two days during the week and every other weekend, but much would depend on who actually picked up the children at school.\nSchedule from April 10, 2017 to October 11, 2017\n[31] The Appellant testified that the actual schedule remained in place from February 2016 to the date of the hearing. During cross-examination, Crown counsel showed the Appellant an email he had written to Ms. Csikai, which reflected certain modifications to the schedule.[5] That email refreshed the Appellant\u2019s memory that from April 10, 2017 to the date of the separation agreement on October 12, 2017, the parties modified the schedule to allow the two youngest children to stay with the Appellant on alternate weekends and every Wednesday. Ms. Csikai testified that on April 10, 2017, the Appellant agreed to the \u201cevery Wednesday and every other weekend\u201d schedule that she had been seeking. Ms. Csikai testified that this modified schedule applied until the separation agreement came into effect in October 2017.\nSchedule from October 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020\n[32] After signing the separation agreement, both the Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that, for the most part, they followed the regular schedule reflected in the separation agreement. Ms. Csikai testified that there were days on which the Appellant\u2019s schedule did not allow him to pick up the children. On those days, she would pick them up.\n[33] The holiday schedule in the separation agreement was a different story. The days were the same, but the pick-up times were earlier. For Christmas, Ms. Csikai and the Appellant would decide whether the Appellant would have any additional days with the children. They would then communicate their agreed arrangements by way of a shared application called \u201cOur Family Wizard\u201d.\n[34] Ms. Csikai testified that the allocation of additional days over the holidays depended on the Appellant\u2019s work schedule. As an executive assistant, she had a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule while the Appellant did shift work. The Appellant confirmed that, depending on his schedule, they would negotiate the allocation of additional days. Ms. Csikai testified that she would do her best to accommodate the Appellant\u2019s work schedule and that the Appellant would do his best to accommodate hers.\n[35] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that they followed the March Break schedule set out in the separation agreement. For Thanksgiving and Easter, they also followed the regular schedule (the two-week rotation) set out in the separation agreement.\n[36] The Appellant testified that in December 2017 he messaged Ms. Csikai on \u201cOur Family Wizard\u201d and attached his work schedule over the Christmas holidays.[6] He testified that he had the two youngest children for additional days from December 29th to January 1st.[7]\nAnalysis\n[37] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in each month with respect to his two youngest children from July 2015 to June 2020. In particular, the issue is whether the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month.\n[38] In Reynolds v The Queen,[8] Justice Valerie Miller computed the hours that children spent at school in two ways. In the first calculation, she excluded the hours the children spent at school. In the second calculation, she allocated the hours the children spent at school based on who dropped them off and picked them up. The choice of method suggested by the Court in Reynolds strikes me as eminently reasonable in light of the absence of any legislative mandate as to which method must be adopted.\n[39] The Appellant effectively conceded the months before February 2016 because his schedule before that time precluded him from hosting the children overnight. Those months are not in issue.\n[40] At trial, the Crown conceded that the Appellant was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in the months of July 2018 and August 2018 and the months of July 2019 and August 2019.[9] Those months are no longer in issue.\n[41] I will divide the remaining period starting February 2016 and ending June 2020 into shorter periods based on the evidence provided at the hearing to determine the Appellant\u2019s eligibility for each month in those periods.\nFebruary 1, 2016 to February 28, 2016\n[42] Ms. Csikai testified that on February 10, 2016, the Appellant agreed to a schedule of one day during the week (Wednesday) and alternate weekends to have the children in his care. She testified that this schedule was in place until the end of February 2016.[10]\n[43] The Appellant testified that the schedule before February 2016 was one weekday and alternate weekends, but that schedule did not continue after February 10, 2016.[11]\n[44] The evidence includes a partial and reconstructed calendar of the Appellant\u2019s work schedule in February 2016 as well as a photograph of a calendar which Ms. Csikai kept contemporaneously and which sets out the days the children spent with the Appellant.[12]\n[45] The calendar evidence shows that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children on five weekdays and over two weekends. Exchanges would occur at school pick up and drop off.[13] The Appellant would pick up the children at 3:10 p.m. and drop them off at 8:45 a.m. each day.\n[46] In February 2016, there were 672 hours in the month (28 x 24). The children were in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children in February 2016:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off.\n[47] Under the method that allocates school hours between the parents, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in February 2016. They resided with Ms. Csikai for 408 hours and with the Appellant for 264 hours.\n[48] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in February 2016. They resided with Ms. Csikai for 324 hours and with the Appellant for 222 hours.\n[49] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in February 2016.\nMarch 1, 2016 to April 10, 2017\n[50] The Appellant testified about the schedule that he and Ms. Csikai used from February 2016 to April 10, 2017.[14] Under that schedule, the Appellant had the two youngest children for alternating weekends and one or two days during the week. Ms. Csikai agreed that the Appellant had the two youngest children in his care during this period on alternating weekends and one or two days per week.[15]\n[51] During his testimony, Ms. Csikai refreshed her memory by using images of her calendar pages for April and October 2016, and January to April 2017.[16] These images, including Ms. Csikai\u2019s contemporaneous notations, confirm that the Appellant had the children in his care on alternating weekends and one or two days per week.\n[52] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that in each month with thirty days during this period, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children for six weekdays and two weekends.\n[53] Based on all of the evidence, this is how a typical thirty-day month during this period would look. The \u201cX\u201d indicates the dates on which the Appellant resided with his two youngest children:\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n[54] A typical thirty-day month has 720 hours (30 x 24). The two youngest children would have been in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children each month during this period:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[55] Under the method that allocates school hours between parents, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in a typical thirty-day month. The Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children for 285 hours and with Ms. Csikai for 435 hours.\n[56] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in a typical thirty-day month. The Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children for 240 hours and with Ms. Csikai for 354 hours.\n[57] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month from March 2016 to April 2017.\nApril 10, 2017 to October 11, 2017\n[58] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai gave evidence that from April 10, 2017 to the date of the separation agreement (October 12, 2017) the two youngest children would spend alternate weekends and every Wednesday with the Appellant.[17] A contemporaneous email from the Appellant to Ms. Csikai confirms this fact.[18]\n[59] In the absence of any evidence that the two youngest children spent any additional time with the Appellant during that period, the Appellant has not demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in any month from April 2017 to October 2017.\nOctober 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020\n[60] The separation agreement set out the schedule that applied from October 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020. As noted above, it provided a regular schedule and a holiday schedule that set out the days on which the Appellant would reside with his two youngest children at various times.\n[61] Although both the Appellant and Ms. Csikai took those schedules seriously, the occasional exception was inevitable. For example, if one of the children became ill, the parent who was then available would pick them up from school, regardless of the schedule.[19]\n[62] In a typical thirty-day month during this period, this is how the schedule would work. The \u201cX\u201d marks the days on which the Appellant resided with his two youngest children:[20]\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n[63] To the extent that the regular schedule was inconsistent with the holiday schedule, the latter prevailed. This is how the holiday schedule modified the regular schedule:\nThe children would reside with the Appellant on December 24th from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.;[21]\nThe Appellant and Ms. Csikai would share the March Break equally;[22]\nThe children would reside with Ms. Csikai on Mother\u2019s Day weekend from Saturday at 7 p.m. to Monday morning school drop off even if the children were then residing with the Appellant in accordance with the regular schedule;[23] and\nThe children would reside with the Appellant on Father\u2019s Day weekend from Saturday at 7 p.m. to Monday morning school drop off even if the children were then residing with Ms. Csikai in accordance with the regular schedule.[24]\n[64] During Christmas holidays, the Appellant and Ms. Csikai would negotiate additional days between them, depending on the Appellant\u2019s work schedule.[25]\n[65] A typical thirty-day month has 720 hours (30 x 24). The two youngest children would have been in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children each month during this period:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[66] Under the method that allocates school hours between the parents, the Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in a typical thirty-day month during this period. The children would have resided with Ms. Csikai for 435 hours and with the Appellant for 285 hours.\n[67] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in a typical thirty-day month during this period. The children would have resided with Ms. Csikai for 354 hours and with the Appellant for 240 hours.\n[68] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month starting on the date of the separation agreement.\nConclusion\n[69] The Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in each of February 2016, March 2016, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\n[70] I conclude, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed as the Appellant is entitled to 50% of the CCB as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in each of those 33 months.[26]\nAfterword\n[71] The Crown pleaded that the Minister made the following assumption in determining that the Appellant was not a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for his two youngest children at any time between July 2015 and June 2020 (at paragraph 22 of the Reply):\n(e) during the Subject Periods, the Appellant regularly resided with the Children an average of 37.5% of the time;\n[72] The Reply defines the phrase \u201cSubject Periods\u201d as \u201cJuly 2015 to June 2016, July 2016, to June 2017, July 2017 to June 2018, July 2018 to June 2019 and July 2019 to June 2020.\u201d[27] This is a period of 60 months. What the Minister has assumed, then, is that over that five-year period the Appellant regularly resided with his two youngest children \u201can average of 37.5% of the time\u201d.[28]\n[73] This \u201caveraging\u201d assumption finds no support in the Act. The relevant legislation does not allow the Minister to \u201caverage\u201d the time a parent resides with a child over a period of more than one month for purposes of determining whether the parent meets the 40% test in each month. On the contrary, the Act requires the Minister to consider each month separately for purposes of that test. That is made clear by the definition of \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in section 122.6 of the Act (emphasis added):\n\u2026 an individual who is one of the two parents of the qualified dependant who\n(a) are not at that time cohabitating spouses or common-law partners of each other,\n(b) reside with the qualified dependant either\n(i) at least 40% of the time in the month in which the particular time occurs, or\n(ii) on an approximately equal basis, and\n(c) primarily fulfil the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant when residing with the qualified dependant, as determined in consideration of prescribed factors.\n[74] Not only does the Minister\u2019s \u201caveraging\u201d method for the 40% test find no support in the statute, it leads to absurd results. For example, assume that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time every other month over a period of 60 months. Also assume that he resided with his two youngest children 35% of the time during each of the months in which he did not reside with them at least 40% of the time.\n[75] According to the Act, the Appellant would have satisfied the 40% test for 30 of those months and would qualify as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each of those months. He would not qualify as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each of the other 30 months as he would have fallen below the 40% threshold for each of those months.\n[76] But according to the Minister\u2019s \u201caveraging\u201d method, the Appellant would not have qualified as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for any month over that 60-month period because he resided with his two youngest children \u201can average of 37.5% of the time\u201d in the words of assumption (e) at paragraph 22 of the Reply. Incorrect methods lead to incorrect results.\n[77] What is the takeaway for the Minister? Simply put, the Minister cannot deny entitlement to a statutory benefit based on a method of computation that finds no support in the words of the statute.[29]\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 31st day of January 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] The appellant received in her bank account a series of deposits from her husband at a time when he had an outstanding income tax debt. The Minister of National Revenue assessed her for the non-arm\u2019s length transfer on the basis that those monies should have been paid to the Minister.\nII. Issue\n[2] The issue in this appeal is whether the Minister properly assessed the appellant under section 160 of the Income Tax Act for $82,055.08 received by her from her husband between January 6, 2014 and April 29, 2015 (the \u201cTransfer Period\u201d).\n[3] At the commencement of hearing, the appellant\u2019s counsel advised that they continue to dispute $47,750 of the transfers but would concede the remainder, i.e. $34,305.08.\n[4] The appellant says that the $47,750 amount consisted of shareholder loan repayments, so do not meet the section 160 criteria.\nIII. Legislative framework\n[5] Subsection 160(1) says that where a person directly or indirectly transfers property to their spouse (or another non-arm\u2019s length person) for inadequate consideration, they are jointly and severally liable for the lesser of: (i) the fair market value of the property, minus the consideration, and (ii) the transferor\u2019s tax liability up to and including the year of transfer. The transfer may be made by means of a trust or \u201cby any other means whatever\u201d. [1]\n[6] The provision was designed to prevent a tax debtor from avoiding tax collection by transferring property to a non-arm\u2019s length person without sufficient consideration.[2] It also applies regardless of whether either person was aware of any tax liability at the time of transfer.[3]\nIV. Factual background\n[7] The parties filed a partial agreed statement of facts. The appellant did not attend the hearing and her husband Emil Remtulla testified on both their behalves.\n[8] The appellant is the sole shareholder of Chrisalex Corporation. Mr. Remtulla testified that she provided bookkeeping services for Chrisalex\u2019s clients; Chrisalex in turn paid her management fees which he believed to be about $43,500 in each of 2013 and 2014.\n[9] Mr. Remtulla is an accountant by profession and stated that he handled Chrisalex\u2019s banking and prepared its financial statements as well as both the corporation\u2019s and the appellant\u2019s tax returns. He explained that Chrisalex remunerated the appellant by way of applying the management fees to her shareholder loan account and she would draw from that account as needed. He acknowledged that there was no written agreement evidencing this arrangement between Chrisalex and the appellant.\n[10] From about January 2013 to May 2014, Chrisalex issued ten cheques totalling $47,750 payable to Mr. Remtulla. Copies of two cancelled Chrisalex cheques from March and April 2014 show Mr. Remtulla as the payee and the appellant signing on behalf of the corporation.[4] Copies of ten cheque stubs completed by Mr. Remtulla were tendered as evidence of the ten Chrisalex cheques.[5] The stubs do not have Chrisalex\u2019s name or account number on them but the numbers on two of the stubs match the two cancelled cheques. Mr. Remtulla explained that the remaining records with respect to these cheques were destroyed by several floods in the basement storage area of their building.\n[11] The stubs show that the cheques ranged in denomination from $300 to $13,900.[6] Mr. Remtulla stated that these cheques were loans from the appellant to him by way of her shareholder loan account, i.e. she drew down from the Chrisalex management fees in her shareholder loan account to in turn loan the monies to Mr. Remtulla by way of the corporate cheques. He testified that he used the funds to pay expenses for which the appellant was responsible such as condominium fees, mortgage payments, and property taxes. No evidence was tendered to shed further light on the nature of the expenses.\n[12] He stated that he then repaid the loans in full by depositing funds into her Royal Bank account[7] during the Transfer Period. He explained that with six to eight expense transactions per month, it was impractical to create a promissory note for each loan. He stated that he and the appellant had been married for 30 years so they trusted each other to honour their respective obligations without the need for written agreements.\n[13] It was agreed by the parties that during the Transfer Period, Mr. Remtulla\u2019s outstanding tax liability exceeded $82,050.[8]\nV. Analysis and discussion\n[14] Four criteria[9] must be met in order to apply subsection 160(1):\na. The transferor must be liable to pay tax under the Act at the time of the transfer;\nb. There must be a transfer of property;\nc. The transferee must be a person with whom the transferor was not dealing at arm\u2019s length or to an otherwise designated transferee; and\nd. The fair market value of the property transferred must exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee for the property.\n[15] It is the fourth criterion that is in issue here.\n[16] Based on the available evidence, I accept that the ten Chrisalex cheques totalling $47,750 were issued and made payable to Mr. Remtulla. I also accept that during the Transfer Period, he made deposits to the appellant\u2019s bank account which were connected or related to these cheques. However, I am unable to conclude from Mr. Remtulla\u2019s oral testimony and the limited documentary evidence that the cheques were loans to him from the appellant, and that his deposits to her bank account were in turn repayments to her.\n[17] The arrangement involving the appellant\u2019s management fees being applied to her shareholder loan account is plausible, as she is the sole shareholder of Chrisalex. However, there is a distinct lack of documentary evidence to support the appellant\u2019s assertion that the deposits to her bank account were loan repayments from Mr. Remtulla.\n[18] The contention that the appellant directed her corporation to loan monies to her husband to pay her expenses rather than paying them herself or directing her corporation to pay them, is sufficiently atypical that reliable documentary evidence becomes all the more important.\n[19] Without documentary evidence, it would have been helpful to hear the appellant testify on her own behalf as to the arrangement rather than to hear only Mr. Remtulla\u2019s account. Mr. Remtulla appeared to handle most of Chrisalex\u2019s and the appellant\u2019s financial affairs, but it would have increased the plausibility of the arrangement to hear the appellant\u2019s understanding of it in her own words. I draw an adverse inference from her absence that her testimony would not likely have been helpful to the appellant\u2019s case.\nVI. Conclusion\n[20] The appeal is dismissed with costs.\n[21] The parties shall have until April 2, 2024 to reach an agreement as to costs, failing which the respondent shall file written submissions by May 15, 2024 and the appellant shall file a written response by June 17, 2024. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten pages in length. If the parties do not advise the Court that they\nhave reached an agreement and no submissions are received by these dates, then costs shall be awarded to the respondent in accordance with Tariff B.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 1st day of February 2024.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 14\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-1379(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMARITES PACHECO AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nCalgary, Alberta\nDATE OF HEARING:\nDecember 12, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 1, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nMatthew Clark\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nDaniel Segal\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nMatthew Clark\nFirm:\nClark Tax Law Calgary, Alberta\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Subsection 160(1), Income Tax Act\n[2] Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd, 2018 FCA 166 at paragraph 3; Eyeball Networks Inc v.

Law and analysis 59\nVIII. The Grant Analysis and Conclusions 60\nI. Pr\u00e9cis [1] These are my reasons on a voir dire to determine whether a remedy is available, and if so what remedy is appropriate, in this proceeding in respect of multiple violations of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights in his related criminal proceedings arising out of CRA\u2019s audit of him and his wife[1].\n[2] In the underlying reassessments in issue, Mr. McCartie is presumed by the Crown to have claimed natural person, sovereign citizen type deductions or non\u2011inclusions to not include, or to significantly reduce, the amount of revenue he reported as taxable and subject to GST\/HST. He was reassessed by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) to deny those deductions and to impose gross negligence penalties.\n[3] Mr. McCartie was also charged criminally with false reporting and evasion under the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d) and with evasion under the Excise Tax Act (\u201cETA\u201d) in respect of these claimed deductions or failures to include in income. His wife was also charged under the ITA with evading taxes. Their criminal cases proceeded together in the British Columbia courts. In a lengthy series of rulings, the BC Provincial Court clearly found that the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights had been violated in multiple respects and on multiple occasions. This included their rights under both section 7 and section 8 of the Charter. The BC Court imposed section 24 Charter remedies in respect of these breaches at several stages of the criminal proceedings. Both CRA Criminal Investigations Division and RCMP police were involved in the events giving rise to the breaches of the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights. In the end, the BC Court stayed the criminal charges because it concluded that, in the circumstances, if there were to be a trial, it would not be possible for the McCarties to receive a fair trial as guaranteed by section 11(d) of the Charter.\n[4] The Charter violations found by the BC Court included breaches of sections 7 and 8 in respect of the search of their home and CRA\u2019s unacceptably negligent loss of its notes and records. The BC Court described the breaches as significant and cumulatively very serious.\n[5] The Charter violations found by the BC Court are not being relitigated in this proceeding, and this Court has not been asked to decide if there were events giving rise to other Charter violations. The only Charter issues in this voir dire are whether a section 24 remedy can be imposed by this Court in respect of Mr. McCartie\u2019s tax appeal for the Charter breaches found by the BC Court in respect of which remedies were already granted in that court and, if so what remedy is appropriate in this Court. This includes possible remedies for breaches of section 8 Charter rights that only exist with respect to criminal proceedings.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I have decided that section 24 of the Charter permits this Court to impose remedies if appropriate in respect of Charter breaches determined by another court in which a remedy is already being, or has been, imposed in respect of that court\u2019s proceedings. I have concluded this could extend, if appropriate, to breaches of Mr. McCartie\u2019s section 7 and section 11 Charter rights which can only be breached in the context of criminal proceedings.\n[7] I have concluded that, in Mr. McCartie\u2019s particular circumstances, certain evidence will not be able to be used by the respondent in this proceeding for certain purposes, whether by way of tendering it in evidence, using it to impeach credibility, referring to it in any manner that is even implicitly suggestive that an adverse inference might be drawn, or otherwise. The excluded evidence is set out below, and includes evidence subsequently obtained by the respondent as a result of having obtained evidence in breach of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. Nor can the respondent use the transcript in this voir dire or these reasons except, as permitted below, with respect to the evidence of the respondent\u2019s witnesses on the substantive issues alone.\n[8] I do not and cannot address at this voir dire stage whether Mr. McCartie\u2019s alleged under-reporting of his income and revenue in the years in question, was done \u201cknowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d permitting the assessment of penalties, or whether it was a misrepresentation permitting reassessments beyond the normal reassessment period. Those issues have to be left until the hearing resumes on the substantive merits.\nII.

Preliminary Matters\n(i) The subpoena of CRA\u2019s Ms. Sundberg. [9] Prior to the hearing, the appellant sought to issue a subpoena for the lead CRA investigator of the McCarties in the years in question, Kathy Sundberg, who testified against them in the BC Court proceedings. Ms. Sundberg had since retired from CRA and the respondent did not want to disclose her address to the appellant. Following a trial management hearing, the respondent agreed it would subpoena Ms. Sundberg and call her as a witness. Attempts to serve Ms. Sundberg were not successful. Based on the multiple process servers\u2019 reports, I concluded prior to the trial date that Ms. Sundberg was very clearly evading service of the Crown\u2019s subpoena. Accordingly, the Court had arrangements in place for the first day of hearing to promptly and effectively address Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to accept service of the subpoena and to attend Court.\n[10] Prior to the first day of the hearing, the parties reached an agreement that Mr. McCartie would not require Ms. Sundberg to testify if certain agreements and concessions were made with respect to her testimony and evidence before the BC Court and that Alan Jones would testify. Mr. Jones was the Team Leader of the CRA Criminal Investigations unit in Vancouver at the relevant times.[2]\n[11] In these circumstances, and for purposes of this proceeding, I will regard Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evidence in the BC Court, and what that court wrote about it, as the most favourable version of events from the respondent\u2019s point of view and Ms. Sundberg\u2019s, as it has not been the subject of further testimony from her or subject to cross-examination in this Court. I will similarly regard what her team leader Mr. Jones testified to in this proceeding regarding Ms. Sundberg as matters Ms. Sundberg would not disagree with as she has herself chose not to testify. Finally, any of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evidence from the BC Court proceedings can be challenged by Mr. McCartie in this proceeding as is specified in the parties\u2019 agreement, subject of course to issue estoppel, abuse of process and\/or similar constraints.\n(ii) Scope of voir dire evidence. [12] This voir dire is to address the issue of what remedy, if any, should be imposed under section 24 of the Charter in respect of the events and concerns giving rise to several breaches by the respondent of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights.\n[13] Mr. McCartie is a self-represented litigant. In this appeal the onus\/burden of proof is on the respondent with respect to both the statute-barred years and gross negligence penalty issues.\n[14] In the interest of efficiency of the appeal process as a whole, the parties were agreeable to the Crown witnesses on this voir dire also giving their evidence on the merits and substantive issues in these appeals. In this decision on the voir dire addressing the issue of remedies, and having decided the remedy will include restrictions on evidence the Crown may submit on the substantive merits regarding these issues, I also need to identify what portion, if any, of their testimony in the voir dire can be used in the hearing on the merits. On this basis, all of the Crown witnesses in this proceeding have given evidence in chief, been cross-examined, and have answered my questions regarding their evidence. Any further Crown evidence in this proceeding will require leave.\n[15] In the circumstances of this case, I would not allow Mr. McCartie to testify in this voir dire to the merits and substantive issues in his appeals. His evidence was limited to the Charter issues and evidence. It did not appear wise to allow an unrepresented appellant testify on a voir dire and submit to cross-examination on the substantive aspects of his appeal. The efficiency of the trial process should not be allowed to override the interests of justice and fairness. When his hearing resumes on the merits, Mr. McCartie and his other witnesses will testify, be cross-examined and answer the Court\u2019s questions at that time, once Mr. McCartie knows what Crown evidence is excluded.\n[16] I did allow Mr. McCartie to testify on a limited basis to facts pertaining to the substantive merits sufficient to provide me with the context he thought I needed to have before hearing the Crown witnesses.\n[17] This hearing lasted [7] days over a 3 month period. Written submissions from the parties were scheduled and received thereafter. The respondent later made written submissions in respect of the subsequent January 2023 decision of juge Lafleur of this Court in Bellevue F\u00e9lix, 2023 CCI 5, to which the appellant was also given the opportunity to respond after being provided by the Court with the official English translation of juge Lafleur\u2019s decision.\n(iii) Crown concession re 2009 ITA gross-negligence penalty. [18] At the outset of the hearing, the respondent conceded the issue of the assessment of a gross negligence penalty under the ITA for the year 2009. The appeal in respect of that 2009 ITA penalty is allowed.\nIV. The Charter Breaches [19] There are a number of decisions of the BC Court in the years 2013 to 2015 involving the related tax evasion charges against the McCarties. That court found several breaches of the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights under sections 7 and 8. In the end, the BC Court judge stayed the charges against both McCarties in 2015 on the basis that, if he allowed the trial to continue without access to evidence relating to the date that CRA\u2019s predominant purpose became an investigation of a potential crime, both because of CRA having lost most of the notes taken by the auditor who made notes of almost everything, and the failure of other auditors and\/or investigators to make and\/or keep notes, and because of the McCarties\u2019 lack of access to the tax lead that may have given rise to the involvement of CRA Criminal Investigations because its contents and\/or date might disclose the identity of the informer, would be to deny them to a fair trial and fundamental justice contrary to sections 8 and 11 of the Charter.[3]\n[20] The following BC Court decisions and reasons are relevant to this voir dire in Mr. McCartie\u2019s tax appeal. All of these are decisions of Judge Gouge, and the McCarties were self represented at each of these hearings. There were at least four earlier decisions of the BC Court in the McCarties\u2019 proceedings dealing with, among other things, the McCarties\u2019 disclosure request for CRA\u2019s notes and records, the McCarties\u2019 asserting of their rights to fairness in their trial, and the issue of informer privilege.\n(i) McCartie 2013 BCPC 221 (\u201cMcCartie 2013-1\u201d) (3-day voir dire hearing)\n[21] In the immediately preceding McCarties decision by another judge, the BC Court determined that informer privilege applied to \u201cAny information which might give rise to a risk of disclosure of the identity of an informer in this case\u201d and \u201cthe Crown aknowledges that the informer, while confidential, was not anonymous, and the Crown is aware of his or her identity\u201d.\n[22] Before the BC Court, at this hearing after the trial had commenced, was the issue of whether certain evidence gathered by CRA using its audit power should be admissible since it was asserted by the McCarties that it was obtained by compelled disclosure at a time that the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s inquiries was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution which is contrary to R. v. Jarvis [2002] 3 SCR 757. Central to this issue was the foundational need for the McCarties to establish the date on which the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s inquiries changed from audit to potential criminal prosecution which that court referred to, and as defined as, the Key Date.\n[23] The evidence regarding the Key Date depended primarily on oral evidence of CRA employees. The Crown asserted that \u201cmuch of the evidence that would shed light on the Key Date would, if disclosed to Mr. and Ms. McCartie, give rise to a risk of disclosure of the identity of the informer\u201d. The Crown asked Judge Gouge that hear that evidence in camera.\n[24] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the evidence in the trial prior to the commencement of the voir dire he was then deciding included the following.\n[25] Jason Brown audited both McCarties\u2019 2002 and 2003 years in 2004. Mr. Brown submitted his audit report to his supervisor in March 2005. Reassessments of both years were issued to both taxpayers. Both McCarties appealed the reassessments and were \u201csubstantially successful\u201d resulting in \u201csignificant reduction\u201d to their reassessed taxes and the cancellation of penalties assessed. Prior to March 2005 Mr. Brown had no communication with CRA Criminal Investigations relating to the McCarties.\n[26] In March 2005 Mr. Brown prepared the Penalty Recommendation Report. The penalty report stated that Mr. McCartie knowingly claimed specific business expenses that he knew were false having: i) deducted a single expense twice; ii) deducted expenses incurred in Canada while he was not in the country; and iii) deducted amounts that were not even incurred.\n[27] Judge Gouge noted that, read grammatically, each of these three assertions is an allegation of criminal fraud by Mr. McCartie. Mr. Brown, however, denied that he intended to make such allegations. That penalty report was sent, as a matter of routine, to Criminal Investigations. Per Judge Gouge \u201cThat is because, in most cases, the circumstances which will justify the imposition of the penalty under section 163(2) of the ITA raised at least the possibility of criminal misconduct\u201d\n[28] In the next two months (prior to June 2005) the Assistant-Director of Criminal Investigations and one of her Investigators summoned Mr. Brown to a meeting with them to discuss whether there should be a criminal investigation of the McCarties. It was decided that they did not warrant a criminal investigation due to the amounts involved and the available evidence. Mr. Brown flagged the McCarties\u2019 audit files for follow-up in future years.\n[29] Mr. Brown transferred to Criminal Investigations for a period of six to seven months in 2007 and worked as an Investigator throughout that time. He could not recall if he took the McCarties\u2019 audit files with him to Criminal Investigations, whether he could access them electronically, or whether Criminal Investigations could access audit files electronically.\n[30] At the end of his seven months in Criminal Investigations, Mr. Brown returned to his duties in Audit. His reminder system brought the McCarties\u2019 audit files forward for review. He noted Mr. McCartie had made an assignment in bankruptcy and that his annual personal expenses reported to the trustee in bankruptcy could not have been funded from his income reported to CRA.\n[31] Mr. Brown\u2019s supervisor and Team Leader in Audit also testified. His team conducted a series of audits of the McCarties during the periods 2002 to 2007. His audit team prepared and printed on February 11, 2008 documents, a portion of which had been rubberstamped after printing with the words \u201cADDITIONAL INFORMATION - SEE INVESTIGATIONS - DO NOT PLACE SCREEN 1 IN TAXPAYER\u2019S FILE\u201d. That rubberstamp is kept in the office of Criminal Investigations and used by Criminal Investigations. Judge Gouge wrote that \u201cit appears at least likely that the stamp was applied after the Key Date\u201d. When the judge asked his own question of the witness about when such a stamp would be applied to documents generally by Criminal Investigations, the Crown objected on the basis an answer might reveal the date of the informer tip and assist the McCarties to identify the informer. When Judge Gouge did not allow the objection, the Crown asked for an in camera hearing to determine which questions the McCarties or the judge could put to CRA witnesses in relation to the Key Date.\n[32] In his analysis, Judge Gouge described as \u201cwell settled\u201d that the right to make full answer and defense is an aspect of the right to fundamental justice guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter. He continued that one cannot make a full answer to evidence which one has not heard. He noted that this may be limited by other pressing juridical objectives and that the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the need to protect informer confidentiality outweighs the right to fundamental justice. Judge Gouge concluded that an in camera hearing should be held to determine the Key Date, but that another judge of the BC court should preside at the in camera hearing. Judge Gouge also noted that, while the onus to prove a Charter breach on a balance of probabilities normally falls on the party alleging the breach, in this case the Crown may carry that onus as the facts pertaining to the Key Date are within the exclusive knowledge of the Crown.\n(ii) McCartie 2013 BCPC 289 (\u201cMcCartie 2013-2\u201d) (3-day voir dire hearing)\n[33] A judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia had held that Judge Gouge had erred in deciding that another BC Provincial Court judge should preside at an in camera hearing and determine the Key Date. The matter was sent back to Judge Gouge.\n[34] Judge Gouge wrote in his background paragraphs that the McCarties explained that they were unable to afford counsel and had been refused legal aid. He continued \u201cthey are intelligent, articulate, well educated people, but have no legal training. As a result, the complex procedural issues now under discussion are difficult for them to understand\u201d.\n[35] In deciding what procedure would best accommodate to the greatest extent the McCarties\u2019 right to a fair trial and give them a fair opportunity to present their case for exclusion of alleged evidence compelled after the Key Date, given the state\u2019s interest in protecting the identity of a confidential informer, Judge Gouge concluded:\nAn adversarial hearing in which all of the evidence is presented by the Crown, and in which no one is entitled to cross-examine the Crown witnesses, is not a fair hearing;\nAn adversarial hearing in which one party, who may bear the onus of proof, is excluded while the other party presents all of the material evidence would be an \u201cextremely unfair hearing\u201d.\nThat, if Judge Gouge were to ask questions of the Crown witnesses on behalf of the McCarties, but without any ability to get instructions from them or to review all of the Crown disclosure to them, that process would be \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d.[4]\nThere should be no in camera hearing to determine the Key Date in the course of the trial, unless and until the Crown identifies that information relevant to the confidential informer identity is about to be, or may be revealed. At that time, the hearing of the trial would proceed in camera until the judge decides the risk has passed.\nWhile the trial is heard in camera, the judge would ask questions of counsel and witnesses as he thinks appropriate which may include a \u201csearching cross\u2011examination\u201d of a witness, and\nWhile excluded from any witness\u2019 testimony, the McCarties could offer suggestions to the judge, in the presence of the Crown but not the witness, as to areas of evidence he ought to explore with each witness and suggestions for cross-examination by the judge when the in camera testimony of the Court continued.\n[36] Judge Gouge noted that he was not confident his procedure would result in a fair trial and that he could only assess that later in the trial. If he were to conclude the trial was not fair, it would then be necessary for him to decide whether it should be allowed to proceed, despite the unfairness, or whether a stay of proceedings should be ordered by him.\n[37] He further noted that, as the standard of proof in proving the Key Date was a balance of probabilities, and given that determinations to such a standard rarely depend on who bears the onus, it might never be necessary to decide where the onus lies in this case.\n(iii) McCartie 2014 BCPC 128 (\u201cMcCartie 2014\u201d) (19-day voir dire hearing)\n[38] Judge Gouge begins by noting that, at this stage, he is at 19 days of a voir dire hearing since resuming the trial after McCartie 2013-2 had started and that the voir dire is incomplete. He suspended this voir dire after he asked the parties if it should be suspended to allow him to hear and decide an application by the McCarties for a stay of judicial proceeding filed months earlier after McCartie 2013-2. The grounds advanced for the stay were that the McCarties had been denied a fair opportunity to prove their case on the voir dire as a result of CRA\u2019s loss of the notes prepared by Annette Coles, a CRA auditor, during the CRA audit of the McCarties for 2005 to 2007. The parties all agreed that the stay application should be heard at that time. However, after Mr. McCartie made their submissions, and just before the Crown was to make its submissions, the McCarties said that they had reconsidered, that they wanted to finish calling their witnesses in the Jarvis voir dire and defer further consideration of the stay application until that had been completed. Judge Gouge decided that it was not appropriate to continue hearing a stay application until either:\n1)All of the evidence on the Jarvis voir dire had been heard; or\n2)All of the parties agreed that enough evidence had been heard on the Jarvis voir dire to return to hear and decide the stay application.\n[39] Further evidence\/facts in this decision: Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the evidence heard to that date was as follows.\n[40] CRA has separate departments for civil audits and for Criminal Investigations that have separate offices, separate staff and separate files. When an auditor suspects that a criminal offence has been committed, they are required to report their suspicions to their team leader. If the team leader considers it appropriate, the team leader reports the facts to Criminal Investigations, which then decides whether to launch a criminal investigation. If it decides to launch a criminal investigation, Audit hands over its file to Criminal Investigations and ceases to have any role with the case.\n[41] The evidence of CRA\u2019s note-taking policies was from two auditors involved with the McCarties\u2019 audits\u2014Ms. Coles mentioned above, and David McLachlin, who took over the audits from Ms. Coles (and who also testified in the voir dire I am now deciding). The evidence of these two auditors diverged on this topic. Judge Gouge summarized Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence; it included:\n[12] Two CRA auditors, Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan, gave divergent evidence about CRA\u2019s note-taking and note retention policies. Ms. Coles said that:\na. She took handwritten notes during all meetings of significance, whether with the taxpayer, with other CRA employees or with external sources of information.\nb. Upon her return to her office, she would transpose those notes onto CRA Form T-2020.\nc. In many cases, her notes on Form T-2020 were more extensive than her handwritten notes because she would supplement her handwritten notes with her memory of the meeting.\nd. Form #T-2020 is used to record notes of: (i) substantive information received; (ii) significant oral communications; and (iii) decisions relevant to the audit, which are not otherwise recorded in writing. So, for example, all oral communications with the individuals who are the subject of the audit are recorded on Form #T-2020, but correspondence with those individuals is not because hard copies of the correspondence are maintained in the correspondence file.\ne. As she understood CRA\u2019s policies, she was required to make notes on Form T-2020 whenever she discussed an audit with her team leader or with any employee of the Investigations Department. Those notes would include summaries of the matters discussed, of any decisions taken and of the reasons for the decisions.\nf. Form T-2020 notes were stored on CRA\u2019s computer system.\n[13] Mr. McLachlan said that he would make a note on Form T-2020 whenever he met with his team leader, but that the note would not necessarily record what was said at the meeting - it might simply record that a meeting occurred. Similarly, if he met with staff of the Investigations Department, and the Investigations Department decided not to launch a criminal investigation, he would note the existence, but not necessarily the substance, of the discussion, on Form T-2020. He said that, if the Investigations Department decided to launch a criminal investigation, he would hand over his files (paper and electronic) to the Investigations Department, and would not thereafter have access to the file, with the result that he could not make any further notes on Form T-2020.\n[14] The evidence includes some examples of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s T-2020 notes on the McCartie file. They are consistent with his oral evidence of his note-taking practice; i.e. they provide few or no details of the matters discussed on the occasions which are the subject of the notes.\n[42] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence included:\n[18] Shortly after issuing his notice of reassessment [for the earlier years 2002-2003 in 2005], Mr. Brown was approached by Ms. Karen Etches and Mr. Greg Chan. Ms. Etches was then the Assistant Director of the Investigations Department and Mr. Chan was an investigator who worked under her supervision. Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan met. Mr. Brown described the meeting in the following terms:\n\u2026 they were asking me questions about possibly conducting an investigation, and I told them that this is mostly just personal expenses, and I don\u2019t think that this would warrant a \u2026 full-on investigation. I just felt that it was just a --- that they [Ms. & Mr. McCartie] were just negligent.\nMr. Brown said that, at the conclusion of the meeting, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan expressed a lack of interest in pursuing a criminal investigation of Mr. & Ms. McCartie.\n[19] Mr. Preshaw [respondent counsel] informed me that Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan have no notes of the meeting, and profess to have no recollection of it.\n[20] Mr. Brown denied that he suspected Mr. or Ms. McCartie of fraud or tax evasion. However, three passages in his report to his team leader, Mr. Gordon Lidster, cast some doubt on the assertion.\na. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nThe taxpayers\u2019 records were inadequate for income tax purposes. Furthermore, some of the expense receipts were not even incurred by the taxpayer.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr. Brown characterized that statement as an assumption, rather than an assertion. The document does not support that characterization.\nb. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlong with the egregious amounts of personal expenses being deducted, there were many other problems with the records. Some of the cash expenses were already recorded.\nIn answer to Mr. McCartie\u2019s question during cross-examination, Mr. Brown confirmed that this passage was intended to convey Mr. Brown\u2019s suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie had double-reported, or claimed twice, certain expenses.\nc. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlso, the taxpayer deducted two receipts from the same restaurant bill.\nIn his oral evidence on the Jarvis voir dire, Mr. Brown denied that he intended any of those assertions to be an allegation of criminal fraud.\n[21] Mr. Brown was transferred from the Audit Department to the Investigations Department for a period of about 6 months in mid-2007.\n[22] In November, 2007, Mr. Brown completed and submitted a document, on CRA Form T-133, entitled \u201cTax Lead or Project Information\u201d, the purpose of which was to recommend a further audit of Ms. & Mr. McCartie, in relation to their tax returns for the years 2005 - 2006. In that document, Mr. Brown said:\nGeodiscovery Interactive Inc is owned by Annie McCartie although day-to-day operations are performed by Annie\u2019s spouse, Colin.\nAnnie and Colin reported a total income of $28,035 from April 1005 to December 31, 2006. However, according to income and expense statements provided to trustee, they have personal expenditures of between $4000 and $5000 per month, or between $84,000 and $105,000 from April, 2005 to December 31, 2006.\nThe only known source of revenue is Annie\u2019s company, Geodiscovery Interactive Inc in 2006. Geodiscovery reported $145,000 in subcontracts on gross sales of $165,000, and no T4A\u2019s issued. Was this $145,000 paid to Colin? Between Colin and Annie, they only reported gross income of $1635 in 2006.\nColin and Annie were previously audited and reassessed for a large amount of expenses that were deducted.[5] In 2004, Colin declared bankruptcy and was absolved of his tax debt.\nIn June, 2007 (outside audit period) the McCarties sold their house for $365,000 and purchased a new house for $540,000. Where\u2019s all this money coming from?\nPossible net worth.\n[23] At the conclusion of Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence, I was left in some doubt about the reliability of his evidence. I found it difficult to reconcile his assertion that he did not suspect Mr. & Ms. McCartie of tax evasion with the documents quoted in paragraphs 20 and 22. That, in turn, led me to doubt his assertion that Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan disclaimed any interest in a criminal investigation.\n[24] Mr. Brown was asked no questions about notes, note-taking or Form T-2020. Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that they asked no questions on that subject because Mr. Brown\u2019s T-2020 notes were not disclosed to them until after Mr. Brown had given his evidence and been excused. I asked him no questions about note-taking because I first learned about Form T-2020 from Ms. Coles, who gave evidence after Mr. Brown. If Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence of CRA\u2019s note-taking policies is correct, Mr. Brown ought to have made detailed notes, in Form T-2020, of his meeting with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan. Some of his T-2020 notes have since been disclosed by the Crown and tendered in evidence. However, the notes disclosed do not include notes from the period after he issued his notice of re-assessment, and so do not span the period in which he met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, and later with Ms. Coles. No notes of those meetings have been disclosed.\n(Emphasis added)\n[43] Mr. Brown\u2019s T-133 Tax Lead was first assigned to auditor Ian Chabot. After making a request to the McCarties for documents related to 2005 to 2007, Mr. Chabot fell ill which is when Ms. Coles became the auditor for the McCarties. Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Ms. Coles evidence included:\n[26] Mr. Chabot fell ill later that summer, and Ms. Annette Coles, another CRA auditor, was assigned to replace him on August 14, 2008. Ms. Coles does not recall whether she met with Mr. Chabot when she assumed conduct of the file. She agrees that, in the normal course, she would meet with the preceding auditor on assuming conduct of an audit, so as to be briefed about what had been done and what remained to be done to complete the audit assignment. However, she believes that she may not have done so in this case because Mr. Chabot was unwell. She is simply uncertain about whether the meeting occurred or not.\n[27] Ms. Coles said that, if she had met with Mr. Chabot, she would have entered her notes of the meeting on Form T-2020.\n[28] Ms. Coles met with Mr. Brown at an early stage of her audit of the McCartie file. She said that she would have made detailed notes of that meeting on Form T-2020.\n[29] At some point in the chronology, CRA received an informer tip in relation to Mr. & Ms. McCartie.[6] Such tips are routed to the Investigations Department. Sometimes, such tips are referred by the Investigations Department to the Audit Department. That was done in relation to Ms. & Mr. McCartie. When first assigned to the file, Ms. Coles attended at the office of the Investigations Department and reviewed the informer tip. She said that she did not discuss the tip with anyone in the Investigations Department, and that she had no other communication with the Investigations Department (in relation to Ms. or Mr. McCartie) until after the McCartie file had been formally referred to the Investigations Department by Mr. McLachlan (see paragraph 43, below).\n[30] On August 25, 2008, Mr. McCartie sent a letter, entitled \u201cNotice of Facts\u201d, to Ms. Coles. Although the document is confusing, it would be reasonable for the reader to infer from it that Mr. McCartie espoused the theory that \u201cnatural persons\u201d (however defined) are not liable to pay income tax. That theory is promoted by a number of people to whom CRA employees commonly refer as \u201ctax protesters\u201d. Ms. Coles said that: (i) after she read the letter, she probably reviewed it with her team leader, Mr. Lidster, at a meeting; and (ii) they both probably concluded that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were tax protesters. If the meeting occurred, she would have recorded the fact of the meeting, the substance of the discussion, and the conclusion reached in a T-2020 note. However, she does not recall the meeting.\n[31] I pause for a necessary digression. The \u201cnatural person\u201d theory is complete nonsense. It has no basis in law. It is not even remotely arguable. It is important to make that clear because some people have been persuaded by it that they are not liable to pay tax, and have suffered as a result.\n[32] Ms. Coles, accompanied by another CRA auditor, Mr. Lecznar, met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie in November, 2008. At the meeting, Mr. & Ms. McCartie provided copies of some of the documents which Ms. Coles wanted to see. Among those were some cancelled cheques with the names of the payees blanked out. Mr. & Ms. McCartie declined to provide the names of the payees or unredacted copies of the cheques. Mr. Lecznar and Ms. Coles each took handwritten notes at the meeting. After the meeting, Mr. Lecznar gave his notes to Ms. Coles and Ms. Coles used them, along with her own, to prepare her T-2020 notes of the meeting. She put the handwritten notes in the file.\n[33] In December, 2008, Ms. Coles met with Mr. Lidster. They decided to exercise CRA\u2019s statutory power to issue notices to certain financial institutions to require those institutions to provide copies of financial records pertaining to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Among the documents sought were unredacted copies of the cheques produced by Mr. & Ms. McCartie at their meeting with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar. Ms. Coles said that she would have made T-2020 notes of her meeting with Mr. Lidster, recording the decision to issue notices to the financial institutions and the reasons for that decision.\n[34] Ms. Coles was transferred to other duties early in 2009. As a result, it was necessary for another auditor to be assigned to the McCartie file. Mr. McLachlan was chosen for that assignment. Because Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan belonged to different teams, a meeting or discussion between the two team leaders was necessary to effect the transfer. If Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence about CRA\u2019 record-keeping policies is correct, there ought to have been a T-2020 note of that communication. No such note has been produced.\n[35] Ms. Coles believes that she met with Mr. McLachlan in or about April, 2009 to acquaint him with the file. She has little recollection of the meeting. She believes that she told him of her suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were tax protesters. She gave Mr. McLachlan her file, including all handwritten and typed notes and all of her T-2020 notes (in electronic form). She did not make a T-2020 note of her meeting with Mr. McLachlan - she expected that he would do that.\n[36] Ms. Coles said that, when she transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan:\na. She had received responses from some, but not all, of the financial institutions.\nb. The audit was incomplete.\nc. She thought that Mr. & Ms. McCartie might have underreported gross business revenues, but, in her view, that did not necessarily mean that they had underreported net income or evaded tax, because she did not know what business expenses had been incurred to generate those business revenues.\nd. She saw no need to refer the file to the Investigations Department.\n[37] After the initiation of this prosecution, Ms. Coles was asked to produce her notes, including her T-2020 notes. She has looked for them, but cannot find them. The last time she saw them was when she handed the file to Mr. McLachlan. As noted below, the evidence provides very little information about how the notes came to be lost. Mr. Preshaw says that the answer to that question may never be known.\n[44] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s evidence included:\n[38] Mr. McLachlan\u2019s team leader, then Mr. Rick Gill, asked him to take on the McCartie audit. Mr. McLachlan does not recall whether he met with Mr. Lidster. He recalls meeting with Ms. Coles, but does not recall what occurred or was discussed at the meeting. He does not recall whether he made notes of the meeting. It was not his view that he was expected or required to make T-2020 notes of the meeting. He recalls that he subsequently met with his team leaders (initially Mr. Gill and latterly Ms. Sally Biggar), but does not recall how many times he met with them about the McCartie audit, nor what was discussed on each occasion. He did not make T-2020 notes of those meetings.\n[39] Mr. McLachlan was busy with other matters, and so unable to give attention to the McCartie audit for some months after receiving the file from Ms. Coles. He thinks that he began work on the file in June, 2009. The only information which he received was: (i) that contained in Ms. Coles\u2019 file; (ii) responses received from financial institutions during the period April - September, 2009 in response to the requests sent out by Ms. Coles in December, 2008. From that material, he concluded that there were \u201cvast discrepancies\u201d between the income reported by Mr. & Ms. McCartie for the years in question and the information provided by the financial institutions.\n[40] Mr. McLachlan had no communication with Mr. or Ms. McCartie on any matter of substance, asked them for no information and received none from them.\n[41] On March 2, 2010, Mr. McLachlan prepared a \u201cPenalty Recommendation Report\u201d, recommending the imposition of a penalty on Mr. McCartie under section 163(2) of the Income Tax Act. In the Penalty Recommendation Report, Mr. McLachlan said (bold print in the original document):\n[Mr. McCartie] is claiming that he is a \u201cNatural Person\u201d and has failed to report any income from his personal business operations. He has failed to report net business income of $404,458.39 for the period 2005-01-01 to 2007-12-31.\n\u2026\n[Mr. McCartie] failed to provide any documents for his personal business operations. He did provide some information for his wife\u2019s corporation (operating as CGM Multimedia). [Mr. McCartie] provided information from the corporation blackened all references to Mr. McCartie and to his bank account information. Mr. McCartie\u2019s name was blackened from the cheques and his endorsement was blackened from the back of the cheques. All references to his name on the invoices he issued to the corporation were also blackened out.\nBank requirements were issued to determine the business operations of [Mr. McCartie] and confirmed the recipients of the funds.\nIt is instructive to compare Mr. McLachlan\u2019s conclusions, as expressed in the Penalty Recommendation Report, with those of Ms. Coles, as noted in paragraph 36, above. Essentially, the two auditors were working from the same information. Mr. McLachlan had a complete set of responses from the financial institutions, but there was no suggestion in the evidence that those records were different in kind from the partial responses received by Ms. Coles before April, 2009, or that the additional responses received after April provided the missing information about Mr. McCartie\u2019s business expenses. As noted below, Mr. McLaclan was prepared to recommend a criminal investigation on the basis of the information he had. Ms. Coles said that she was not.\n[42] Mr. McLachlan reviewed the Penalty Recommendation Report with his team leader, Ms. Sally Biggar, on March 4, 2010. Ms. Biggar approved the report on that day.\n[43] Once a Penalty Recommendation Report is approved, a copy is sent to the Investigations Department as a matter of routine. That was done in this case. On March 4, 2010, Ms. Biggar signed a document entitled \u201cReferral to Enforcement Division\u201d, in which the following allegation was made (bold print in the original document):\nThe taxpayers have failed to report over $525,000.00 in Income Tax revenue and almost $30,000 in GST. Colin McCartie has been claiming that he is a Natural Person and has failed to report any of the income he received from 2005 to 2007.\n[44] Sometime after March 4, 2010, staff of the Investigations Department came to Mr. McLachlan\u2019s office with a search warrant and seized his file. That seemed to him to be an unusual procedure. In the ordinary case, if a file was to be referred to the Investigations Department, the file would simply be handed over without a warrant.\n[45] The McCarties asked Judge Gouge to compel a number of CRA witnesses to testify in the Jarvis voir dire along with one Justice lawyer. The CRA witnesses requested were those involved in CRA\u2019s Project Fable, a Canada-wide program of targeted prosecutions of Canadians CRA believed to be tax protesters. They could provide evidence whether, and if so when, the McCarties became targets of Project Fable. The Justice lawyer was requested to provide evidence regarding a letter he sent to the McCarties in 2013 about the lost audit notes (including the ones Ms. Coles knew she had written). The Justice lawyer wrote \u201cWe understand that T2020 notes are ordinarily kept during the course of an audit. We have made inquiries in this regard. Unfortunately, we understand that due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases, the T2020 entries were not retained in this matter. We understand that you have all available T-2020 Notes\/Memo for File notes that have been retained\u201d.\n(iv) McCartie 2015 BCPC 066 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-1\u201d) (2-day voir dire hearing)[7]\n[46] In his opening summary of the \u201clong and complex procedure history\u201d of the prosecution of the McCarties, J. Gouge included that Crown counsel had informed the Court that the evidence obtained by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers from the McCarties\u2019 banks \u201cis crucial to the Crown case\u201d. Judge Gouge\u2019s full summary is attached to these reasons as Appendix A. This hearing addressed Ms. Coles missing audit notes (the \u201cColes Notes\u201d) in the context of the request to have the previous Justice lawyer testify regarding his letter to the McCarties that the Coles Notes were not retained following, and as a result of, a digitisation conversion of records by CRA.\n[47] Judge Gouge wrote:\n[4] Ms. Coles said that she had been instructed by her superiors to make notes, in every audit, of the substance of all meetings with her team leaders and with representatives of the Investigations Department, and to record in those notes the substance of the discussion and of any decisions or conclusions reached at the meeting. She understood that the preparation and retention of those notes was one of the duties of her employment. Notes of that kind are admissible in evidence pursuant to section 26 of the Canada Evidence Act RSC 1985, c C-5, which provides:\n\u2026\n[5] Ms. Coles acknowledged that her recollection of her meetings with other CRA employees was vague. Her notes may have contained a record of comments made by other CRA employees respecting suspicion of tax evasion on the part of Mr. or Ms. McCartie or the intentions of those other CRA employees respecting prosecution for such an offence. Of course, one could not say that with confidence without first seeing the notes. I observe that, at common law, an out-of-court statement by a person of that person\u2019s motivation or intention is admissible as evidence of that person\u2019s motivation or intention, if such motivation or intention is a fact in issue and the statement is tendered by a party adverse in interest. Such out-of-court statements by other CRA employees could be proven by Ms. Coles\u2019 notes.\n[6] Mr. McFadgen\u2019s point, as I understand it, is that the intentions or motivations of CRA\u2019s staff are not facts in issue in the prosecution, but only on the application by Mr. & Ms. McCartie to exclude the bank records from evidence. The nub of his submission is that the Crown\u2019s duty to preserve and disclose evidence is limited to evidence bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence, and does not extend to evidence bearing on an alleged infringement of a Charter right. Mr. McFadgen referred me to no authority in which such a limitation is expressly stated, and I am not aware of any.\n[7] I do not think that the Crown\u2019s duty to preserve and disclose evidence should be limited as proposed by Mr. McFadgen. It seems to me unreasonable to suggest that evidence which may assist the accused to prove an infringement of a Charter right, and so to support an application for a judicial stay of the prosecution, is less important or less worthy of preservation than evidence which may assist the accused to establish a substantive defence to the charge or to impugn the credibility of Crown witnesses. I observe that the duty to preserve evidence was described in Regina vs La as a logical extension of the duty to disclose established by Regina vs Stinchcombe. It is well-settled that the disclosure obligation is not confined to documents which would be admissible in evidence, but extends to documents, like witness statements, which might be useful to the defence in other ways. To take another example, a police recording of an interrogation of the accused must be disclosed because it may assist the accused to challenge the voluntariness of any statements made by the accused or to establish an infringement of his Charter rights during the interrogation.\n[8] However, I think it important to acknowledge that the Crown\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence relevant to infringements of Charter rights is subject to the same limitations as the Crown\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence relevant to the substantive elements of the offence. For example, in Regina vs La at paragraph 21, Sopinka, J said:\nThe police cannot be expected to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the future. In addition, even the loss of relevant evidence will not result in a breach of the duty to disclose if the conduct of the police is reasonable. But as the relevance of the evidence increases, so does the degree of care for its preservation that is expected of the police.\nI have not yet heard submissions on the question whether it would be reasonable to expect CRA to preserve Ms. Coles\u2019 notes in this case.\n\u2026\n[10] Mr. McFadgen says that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes are not \u201c\u2026 fruits of the investigation \u2026\u201d because they are not records of information obtained from others, but rather records of CRA\u2019s internal proceedings. Ms. Coles describes her notes as including both types of information. However, the purpose for which they are presently sought is to assist in determining the state of mind of CRA staff at the relevant times.\n[11] It is difficult to answer the question without seeing the notes. In light of Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence, it is reasonable to infer that the notes might contain one or more of the following:\na. references to information obtained by CRA from outside sources which might reasonably lead the reader to conclude that Mr. or Ms. McCartie had committed an offence of tax evasion;\nb. notes of oral statements by CRA employees to the effect that they had, or had not, reached such a conclusion, firmly or tentatively;\nc. expressions of intention by CRA employees in relation to possible prosecution of Mr. or Ms. McCartie.\nReferences of the first kind might support an inference that, as at the date of the meeting recorded in the note, CRA intended to prosecute, because any reasonable person in possession of such information would form that intention. Notes of the second or third kind might be direct evidence of such an intention. References of the first kind might be properly described as \u201c\u2026 fruits of the investigation \u2026\u201d. Notes of the second or third kind would not.\nTHE THIRD QUESTION\n[12] In Regina vs La at paragraph 20, Sopinka, J said:\nThe right of disclosure would be a hollow one if the Crown were not required to preserve evidence that is known to be relevant. Yet despite the best efforts of the Crown to preserve evidence, owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost. The principle in Stinchcombe (No. 2), supra, recognizes this unfortunate fact. Where the Crown's explanation satisfies the trial judge that the evidence has not been destroyed or lost owing to unacceptable negligence, the duty to disclose has not been breached. Where the Crown is unable to satisfy the judge in this regard, it has failed to meet its disclosure obligations, and there has accordingly been a breach of s. 7 of the Charter. Such a failure may also suggest that an abuse of process has occurred, but that is a separate question. It is not necessary that an accused establish abuse of process for the Crown to have failed to meet its s. 7 obligation to disclose.\nThat passage seems to me to place on the Crown the onus of proving how the missing documents came to be lost. In the absence of any admissible evidence on the point, the court is bound to infer that they were lost deliberately or by unacceptable negligence.\n[Emphasis added]\n(v) McCartie 2015 BCPC 69 (McCartie 2015-2) [48] This was an application by the McCarties for a judicial stay of their prosecution on the basis that, in their particular prevailing circumstances, it was impossible for them to have a fair trial as they are entitled to under section 11(d) of the Charter.\n[49] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the issues, prevailing circumstances and questions, are attached, along with his summary of evidence, as Appendix B.\n[50] Judge Gouge decided the application on the basis that the McCarties had the onus to prove the facts they alleged and most importantly that CRA\u2019s predominant purpose in December 2008 was to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution when they made the December 2008 Request For Information (\u201cRFI\u201d) from the McCarties\u2019 banks, following a November 2008 meeting with the McCarties.\n[51] He went on to summarize the McCarties\u2019 hypotheses that:\n[15] Ms. Coles said that, when she issued the demands to the banks, she had no interest in a criminal investigation. She said that her job was to conduct civil audits of tax returns, and that was what she did in relation to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Mr. & Ms. McCartie tell me that they do not challenge Ms. Coles\u2019 veracity. However, they do advance the following hypothesis:\na. In 2005, Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan formed the opinion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were guilty of tax evasion, but that CRA lacked the evidence to support a prosecution.\nb. Mr. Brown recommended a further audit in 2007 for the purpose of gathering the necessary evidence.\nc. Ms. Coles was the unwitting tool of the Investigations Department, and was used by the Investigations Department to procure the evidence from the banks.\n[52] Judge Gouge went on to a detailed summary of Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence regarding her notes involving the McCarties\u2019 audit and her interactions with Criminal Investigations and with Mr. McLachlan. Ms. Coles followed her normal note-taking practice throughout the McCarties\u2019 audits, she entered her T2020 notes of the McCarties audit on CRA\u2019s computer system, and she gave her handwritten notes to Mr. McLachlan when she transferred the file to him in 2009. She believes that she may not have met with her predecessor Mr. Chabot when she assumed conduct of the audits from him, as would have been her practice. If they did meet, she would have entered her notes of the meeting on a T2020 also. Ms. Coles met with Mr. Brown at an early stage of her McCartie audit and made detailed notes of that meeting on a T2020. Ms. Coles attended at Criminal Investigations when she was first assigned to the file to review the informer tip, that she said she did not discuss it with anyone in Criminal Investigations and did not have any other communications with Criminal Investigations regarding the McCarties until after Mr. McLachlan formally referred their file to Criminal Investigations. Upon receipt of Mr. McCartie\u2019s letter of August 2008 espousing a natural person tax exemptions theory, she probably reviewed it with her Team Leader at a meeting, and, if so, she would have recorded the substance of their discussion and the conclusion reached in the T2020. Following a November 2008 meeting of the McCarties with Ms. Coles and her colleague Mr. Lecznar, Mr. Lecznar gave Ms. Coles his handwritten notes of the meeting which she used along with her own to write notes to prepare her T2020. These handwritten notes are among the Coles\u2019 Notes that CRA has lost. Ms. Coles also prepared the T2020 of her meeting with her Audit colleague, Mr. Lidster, at which they decided to issue requirements to the McCarties\u2019 bankers. Ms. Coles did not prepare a T2020 following her April 2009 meeting with Mr. McLachlan to acquaint him with the McCarties\u2019 files as responsibility had been reassigned to him when she was transferred to other duties in late 2009 and she expected Mr. McLachlan would do that.\n[53] When Ms. Coles was asked to produce her notes, including her T2020 notes, she looked for them but could not find them. She last saw them when she handed her file to Mr. McLachlan. Some of her handwritten notes relating to the McCarties\u2019 audit have been produced but none of her T2020 notes. Judge Gouge was informed by counsel appearing on the application that they had been \u201clost\u201d.\n[54] Judge Gouge summarized the evidence regarding the loss of the Coles Notes and other CRA notes as follows:\n[32] In a letter to Mr. & Ms. McCartie dated August 15, 2103, Mr. Gibson, then Crown counsel, said:\nWe understand that T2020 notes are ordinarily kept during the course of an audit. We have made enquiries in this regard. Unfortunately, we understand that, due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases, the T2020 entries were not retained in this matter. We understand that you have all available T2020 notes\/Memo For File notes that have been retained.\nIn a letter to Mr. Preshaw (who succeeded Mr. Gibson as Crown counsel) dated July 18, 2014, Mr. Gibson said:\nI now understand that the McCarties interpreted my correspondence as confirmation that further notes did exist, were not disclosed, and were lost through the database design. I do not know if this was the case. I cannot verify what notes were originally created by CRA. My primary concern, upon drafting the letter, was to indicate that there were no further materials to provide and to advise the McCarties of the possibility that notes may have been deleted. Questions as to whether notes were actually lost should be directed to the relevant CRA employees.\nMs. Coles was quite clear in her evidence that she did make T-2020 notes of the McCartie audit. Mr. McFadgen was equally clear in his assertion at the hearing before me that they have been lost. The source of Mr. Gibson\u2019s assertion that the notes were lost \u201c\u2026 due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases \u2026\u201d has not been identified. No other information has been provided to assist in determining how or when the notes came to be lost.\n[55] Judge Gouge went on to address documents that CRA might be expected to have created but may never have existed, and their relevance to the stay application he was deciding. Neither the Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations Ms. Etches, nor Investigator Chan had yet testified. The Crown advised that neither of them had any recollection of their meeting with Auditor Brown in 2005 and that \u201cno notes of that meeting exist\u201d. All parties asked that the stay application not await further testimony of Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, and the Court proceeded on that basis in fairness to the accused McCarties. The McCarties\u2019 assertion on the stay application was that the failure to make notes of that meeting by Etches, Chan and Brown impairs the McCarties\u2019 ability to effectively cross-examine any of Brown, Etches or Chan as to their intentions and motives, and this has the effect of denying them their right to a fair trial.\n[56] In his reasons, Judge Gouge emphasised that appropriate pre-trial disclosure is essential to a fair trial, and that a failure to make such disclosure may render the trial unfair. He framed the questions he was deciding on this application as \u201cwhether, in light of what CRA did, or did not do, in relation to making and retaining notes, the trial upon which I am now engaged is as fair as it could reasonably be expected to be. If the answer to that question is \u201cno\u201d, then Mr. and Ms. McCartie are denied their right to a fair trial. Such a conclusion does not necessary imply a finding of misconduct on the part of CRA\u201d.\n[57] Judge Gouge wrote of Ms. Coles and her notes as follows:\n[43] I accept, as do Mr. & Ms. McCartie, that Ms. Coles was a truthful witness, who did her best to recount accurately the events in which she participated. It necessarily follows that her intention or motivation was solely to conduct a civil audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns. That fact does not preclude the possibility that she was used by others to gather evidence for a prosecution. The present question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that her lost notes would assist in proving that fact. I think that there is.\n[44] In paragraph 6, above, I quote certain passages from Mr. Brown\u2019s contemporaneous notes which cast doubt on his assertion that, in 2005, he suspected Mr. & Ms. McCartie of gross negligence in the preparation of their returns, but not of fraud. In paragraph 10, I quote his recommendation to initiate the second audit, in the course of which CRA obtained the bank records. In my view, that document is consistent only with a suspicion on the part of Mr. Brown that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were guilty of tax fraud. Mr. Brown and Ms. Coles met at the inception of her audit. She has now no independent recollection of that meeting. It is reasonably probable that, at the meeting, Mr. Brown told her what he had discovered in the course of his earlier audit and what conclusions he had reached. If he had done so, Ms. Coles, in accordance with her usual practice, would have recorded those remarks in her T-2020 notes. It would be instructive to compare: (i) what Mr. Brown said in his 2005 notes (quoted in paragraph 6 above); (ii) what Mr. Brown said in his 2007 recommendation (quoted in paragraph 10, above); (iii) what Mr. Brown said to Ms. Coles (which would have been recorded in Ms. Coles lost notes); and (iv) Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence at this trial.\n[45] Ms. Coles attended at the offices of the Investigations Department at the inception of her audit to review the informer tip. She says that she did not speak with anyone in the Investigations Department about the file. Of course, that cannot be literally true - someone in the Investigations Department must have pulled the tip from the file and given it to her to review. Some words must have been exchanged. Ms. Coles\u2019 memory of the event is, understandably, vague. It would be unreasonable to exclude the possibility that a discussion took place which was recorded in the lost notes. Accepting, as I do, Ms. Coles\u2019 honesty, there may well have been something in that discussion which would be of assistance to the defence, although Ms. Coles attributed no significance to it at the time.\n[46] Ms. Coles met with her team leader, Mr. Lidster, after she and Mr. Leczner met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie and before Ms. Coles issued her statutory demands to the banks. The purpose of the meeting was to seek Mr. Lidster\u2019s authorization to issue the demands. Ms. Coles\u2019 lost notes contained a record of that meeting. It is possible that Mr. Lidster made comments similar to those quoted in paragraph 10. If so, they would be capable of supporting an inference that Mr. Lidster suspected Mr. & Ms. McCarty of fraud. That, in turn, might support an inference that Mr. Lidster was interested in a prosecution when he authorized the demands to be issued to the banks.\n[47] I conclude that there is a real possibility that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes would have been of assistance to the defence and that the Crown has not discharged its onus of proving that they were not lost by unacceptable negligence. It follows from those two conclusions that there has been an infringement of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. In R vs Carosella @ paragraph 37, Justice Sopinka said:\nThe right to disclosure of material which meets the Stinchcombe threshold is one of the components of the right to make full answer and defence which in turn is a principle of fundamental justice embraced by s. 7 of the Charter. Breach of that obligation is a breach of the accused's constitutional rights without the requirement of an additional showing of prejudice. To paraphrase Lamer C.J. in Tran, the breach of this principle of fundamental justice is in itself prejudicial. The requirement to show additional prejudice or actual prejudice relates to the remedy to be fashioned pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.\n[48] In this case, the Crown has offered no explanation for the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes. There is no basis upon which I could conclude that they were not lost by unacceptable negligence. Accordingly, I must conclude that there has been a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 7 of the Charter.\n(Emphasis added)\n[58] Judge Gouge wrote of the absence of note taking by all other than Ms. Coles, and their impact on the fairness of the trial to the McCarties, as follows:\n[49] Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that the omission by Mr. Brown, Mr. Lidster, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes of their communications is a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under sections 7 and 11 of the Charter. During argument, the parties characterized this issue as raising the question whether those individuals had a duty to make notes in the circumstances pertaining. Mr. & Mrs. McCartie also complained of the failure of Mr. McLachlan to make notes. However, I consider that to be of no significance because the question is CRA\u2019s motive or intention in December, 2008, when notices were delivered to compel disclosure of the bank documents, and Mr. McLachlan had no role in the case until the spring of 2009.\n[50] Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that the duty to make notes arises from two sources:\na. They say that there is a legal duty, of general application, on police officers to make notes, and the same duty should apply to CRA investigators.\nb. They refer to many entries in CRA policy manuals and training materials, which instruct CRA investigators to make and retain detailed notes.\n[51] In support of the first proposition, they rely on Wood vs Schaeffer 2013 SCC 71 (CanLII), [2013] 3 SCR 1053. However, I note that Wood vs Schaeffer was concerned with the application of a particular Ontario regulation, having the force of statute, which expressly imposed specific obligations on Ontario police officers to make notes in specific circumstances. I was referred to no statute which imposes a similar obligation on CRA staff. In the absence of such a statute, I think that the legal position was correctly stated in Regina vs Davidoff 2013 ABQB 244; i.e. note-taking is a prudent and responsible police practice, but not a legal obligation.\n[52] I do consider CRA\u2019s policies and training manuals to be of significance. I discuss that issue in paragraphs 60 - 61, below. However, they do not create legal duties: Hewko vs British Columbia 2006 BCSC 1638; [2006] BCJ #2877 @ paragraphs 313 \u2013 318.\n[53] I conclude that the CRA staff were under no legal obligation to make notes.\nTRIAL FAIRNESS\n[54] Having addressed the application on the basis advanced by the parties, I return to my own view of the matter. To my mind, there are two questions:\na. Does the absence of contemporaneous notes materially impair the fairness of this trial?\nb. If so, is it reasonable to expect that CRA would have prepared and preserved such notes?\nI think that the first question is mandated by section 11(d) of the Charter and the second question by Thomson Newspapers @ paragraphs 170 \u2013 178. If the answer to each question is \u201cyes\u201d, there has been an infringement of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter right to a fair trial.\n[55] These are different questions from the question whether CRA staff had a legal duty to take notes. As I have said, I do not think that they did. I find nothing in section 11(d) to support the inference that an unfair trial constitutes a denial of the Charter right only where the unfairness results from a breach of a legal duty by a government agent. Section 11(d) simply says that an accused person is entitled to a fair trial. If the trial is unfair, having regard to the principle that it need only be as fair reasonably possible, the right to a fair trial is infringed. There may be cases in which a fair trial is precluded by some unfortunate accident which is the fault of no one. In such a case, it may be that an unfair trial cannot be allowed to proceed, subject always to the balancing of public and private interests described in Thomson Newspapers. In this case, if it would have been reasonable to expect Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes, and they did not, and the result is an unfair trial, the consequence may be that the trial cannot proceed.\n\u2026\n[57] In order to assess the effect of the lost and missing notes on trial fairness, it is necessary to consider the formidable task which Mr. & Ms. McCartie face on the Jarvis issue. They carry the onus of proving, in 2015, the states of mind of three hostile witnesses (Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan) in 2005 \u2013 2007. If the question were whether a witness performed some physical act 10 years ago, one might hope to find an independent witness to the event or some physical evidence that the act occurred. In some cases, the state of mind of a witness can be proven by reference to actions taken or omitted by the witness. For example, a person who is angry with another rarely seeks the company of the other. In this case, it is difficult to imagine how the state of mind of Ms. Etches, Mr. Brown or Mr. Chan could be proven except by leading evidence of words which they uttered. The Crown asserts, and the defence accepts for the purpose of this application, that they have no present recollection of what they said in 2005. Even assuming that they would be completely candid when cross-examined, it would not be possible to prove their state of mind because they don\u2019t remember what they said. The only avenue of cross-examination open to Mr. & Ms. McCartie would be to put to the witnesses the proposition that, in 2005, they suspected Mr. & Ms. McCartie of tax evasion and launched the second audit in search of evidence to prove it. It seems safe to assume that the witnesses would deny any such intention. There would be no further question which the cross-examiner could usefully ask.\n[58] By contrast, if notes had been made, the notes might well offer ammunition to the cross-examiner. By way of example, I refer to the documents authored by Mr. Brown (paragraphs 6, 10, above).\n[59] Of course, one cannot say whether the notes would have been helpful to the defence unless one has seen the notes. In that circumstance, the question is whether there is a real possibility that they would have been: Regina vs Carosella @ paragraphs 30 \u2013 36. I conclude that such a real possibility exists in this case, and so conclude that the first of my two questions should be answered in the affirmative.\n[60] The next question is whether it would be reasonable to expect Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make and retain notes of their communications. Two items of evidence cause me to answer that question in the affirmative.\na. Ms. Coles did, as a matter of routine. There was nothing in her evidence to indicate that she found the practice to be burdensome or impractical. If she had attended the 2005 meeting, rather than Mr. Brown, she would have made a detailed T-2020 note of the meeting, including the substance of the discussion, the decision taken and the reasons for the decision. Nothing in the evidence supports the conclusion that it would have been more difficult for Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches or Mr. Chan to do so.\nb. CRA\u2019s policy and training manuals contain many instructions to CRA staff to make and retain detailed notes. To take only the most apposite of many examples, CRA\u2019s training manual for investigators recommends that the investigator interview the auditor after reviewing the auditor\u2019s file and before deciding to proceed with an investigation. In relation to that interview, the manual states:\nTake notes of the interview. It is imperative that notes be taken during the interview or as soon after as possible. Those notes should be as accurate as possible. They can be handwritten or typed. However, your handwritten notes must be retained for future reference. They could possible (sic) be called into question during the trial.\nIt seems to me that it cannot be unreasonable to expect CRA investigators to comply with the instructions of their management on the point in question.\n[61] I hasten to say that, in my view, the reasonableness of an expectation that an investigator take and retain notes is highly fact-specific. For example, very different factors would require consideration in the case of a police officer conducting a traffic stop or executing a search warrant at a crack house.\n[62] Having answered both of my questions in the affirmative, I conclude that Mr. & Ms. McCartie have been denied their right to a fair trial.\n(Emphasis added)\n[59] See also the close of paragraph 68 dealing with costs and whether these were extraordinary circumstances wherein Judge Gouge repeats that this was not a case of misconduct on the part of CRA. \u201cIt has failed to discharge its onus of proof in relation to the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes, but there is no evidence from which I could infer deliberate destruction of those notes, or culpable negligence causing their loss. The omission of Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes was not culpable\u2014they were under no obligation to make them. The omission to make and keep them has prevented Mr. and Mrs. McCartie from exercising their rights to a fair trial, but that does not render their omission culpable. I do not consider this an exceptional case in which the omission to make notes rises to the level of an abuse of process\u201d.\n(Emphasis added)\n[60] Judge Gouge went on to conclude that the appropriate remedy in the McCarties\u2019 particular circumstances was not to stay the proceedings at that time, but to restrict what evidence the Crown could rely on:\n[66] The only alternative remedy suggested by Mr. McFadgen is the possibility that, when assessing the credibility of Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, I should take into account the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes and the omission of the others to make notes. In my view, that remedy would be inadequate to address the prejudice to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. They carry the onus of proving CRA\u2019s motive and intentions. That onus can be discharged only by affirmative evidence. An adverse inference may assist in corroborating or reinforcing affirmative evidence, but is not a substitute for affirmative evidence. For that reason, it has been held that \u201c\u2026an adverse inference will not be drawn where the effect of drawing such an inference is to reverse the onus of proof \u2026\u201d: McIlvenna vs Viebeg 2012 BCSC 218; [2012] BCJ #292 @ paragraph 70. At present, the only affirmative evidence of CRA\u2019s motive and intentions consists of: (i) Mr. Brown\u2019s notes, quoted in paragraphs 6, 10, above; and (ii) the notable circumstance that Mr. Brown proposed the second audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns, in the course of which the bank documents were procured, within a month or so of his return to the Audit Department from the Investigations Department. Coupled with an adverse inference, that evidence might support a conclusion that the hypothesis advanced by Mr. & Ms. McCartie is correct, but it is not a strong case for the defence. By comparison, if Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan had kept notes, and if they had expressed themselves in a manner similar to Mr. Brown, the notes might have presented a compelling case for the McCartie hypothesis.\n[67] However, I do not think that a judicial stay of the prosecution is necessary. The prejudice to Mr. & Ms. McCartie can be remedied by excluding from evidence all documents procured by CRA by the exercise of its statutory powers during the second audit. If the Crown can prove its case without those documents, it should do so.\n\u2026\n[69] All documents procured by CRA by the exercise of its statutory powers during the second audit (conducted by Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan) will be excluded from evidence.\n(Emphasis added)\n(vi) McCartie 2015 BCPC 233 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-3\u201d) [61] In this application Judge Gouge was deciding whether Ms. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights were infringed during a search of the McCarties\u2019 home by CRA Criminal Investigations agents and the RCMP in August of 2010. Ms. McCartie was at home with their daughter; Mr. McCartie was not present at the time of the search. If so, the application was also asking to exclude from evidence the documents seized by CRA during that search. Judge Gouge stated at the outset that he would refrain from commenting on whether the conduct of the CRA investigator is deserving of criticism because those issues had not been fully argued.\n[62] The pertinent evidence was from Investigator Sundberg who was in charge of the search, and Mr. Stenchman, an Investigator who was assisting her, as well as RCMP Constable Reynolds. To the extent their testimony differed, Judge Gouge accepted Mr. Stenchman\u2019s testimony.\n[63] Investigator Sundberg applied for and was granted a warrant to search the McCarties\u2019 Nanaimo home on August 30, 2010. The following morning at 9:00 a.m. Ms. Sundberg attended the McCarties\u2019 home accompanied by Mr. Stenchman, Constable Reynolds, eight other CRA Investigators, and one other RCMP Officer. (In his testimony in this voir dire before me, Mr. Jones, head of Criminal Investigations in Vancouver, said he was among those present throughout.)\n[64] Ms. Sundberg went to the front door accompanied by Mr. Stenchman and Constable Reynolds in uniform. Ms. Sundberg had a copy of the search warrant in her hand, and the original search warrant under her arm.\n[65] Upon answering the door with the security latch on, Ms. Sundberg informed Ms. McCartie she had a warrant and demanded Ms. McCartie open the door. Ms. McCartie asked for the warrant. Ms. Sundberg did not give it to her but replied by asserting that Ms. McCartie was obliged to open the door and that, if she did, Ms. Sundberg will enter the house and go over the warrant with her. Ms. McCartie said she was going to call a lawyer and closed the door. About a minute later, Ms. McCartie opened the door again with the security latch in place. Constable Reynolds told her that Ms. Sundberg had a warrant and that Ms. McCartie was obliged to open the door. Constable Reynolds told her that he had authority to break down the door, and that he would do so unless she opened it immediately. Ms. McCartie closed the door again.\n[66] A few minutes later Ms. McCartie unlatched and opened her front door. Accompanied by her daughter, she stepped outside of the house and again asked for the warrant. Ms. Sundberg\u2019s reply was that if Ms. McCartie would go in to the house with her, she would go over the warrant with her. Ms. McCartie declined that invitation. Ms. McCartie then walked with her daughter to their vehicle and drove off. The door was left at least somewhat opened; Judge Gouge does not suggest whether this was intentional or an oversight. There is no suggestion in his reasons that it could have been considered an invitation to enter without showing her the search warrant.\n[67] Both RCMP officers then entered the house to satisfy themselves there were no threats to the investigators\u2019 safety. The CRA Criminal Investigations\u2019 investigators then entered and search the house and seized a number of documents.\n[68] Judge Gouge then considered the requirements of section 29(1) of the Criminal Code which provides:\n\u201cIt is the duty of everyone who executes a process or warrant to have it with him, where it is feasible to do so, and to produce it when requested to do so\u201d\n\u00ab Quiconque ex\u00e9cute un acte judiciaire ou un mandat est tenu de l\u2019avoir sur soi, si la chose est possible, et de le produire lorsque demande lui en est faite \u00bb\n[69] When asked by Judge Gouge why she did not give Ms. McCartie the copy of the warrant in her hand when asked, Ms. Sundberg\u2019s reasons included that she wanted to offer Ms. McCartie the chance to go over the warrant after she was inside the house to induce Ms. McCartie to let her inside the house. That is \u201cshe wanted to use the document as a lever to induce Ms. McCartie first, to open the door and allow Sundberg to enter, second, to identify herself, and, third, to engage in a discussion of the warrant with Ms. Sundberg\u201d. In the circumstances Judge Gouge also wrote \u201cunless and until shown a copy of the warrant Ms. McCartie was under no obligation to open the door\u201d nor to identify herself. He also wrote \u201cMs. McCartie was under no obligation to speak with Ms. Sundberg. Indeed, as a person under investigation, she was wise to decline that invitation.\u201d Ms. Sundberg also said that in her opinion she was not obliged to produce the warrant or give Ms. McCartie a copy until she had executed the warrant, which would not be until she crossed the threshold, which she had not yet done when asked by Ms. McCartie.[8]\n[70] Judge Gouge found that none of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s explanations rendered it impracticable for her to have given Ms. McCartie a copy when she first asked for it. He also gave very short shrift to the Crown\u2019s more technical arguments that to produce it did not mean to provide a copy, that the RCMP had not yet ensured that entering the house was safe, and the possibility that evidence was being destroyed as they spoke outside the home.\n[71] Judge Gouge wrote about the failures of Ms. Sundberg and Constable Reynolds:\n[18] There was a simple, easy and harmless mode of production available to Ms. Sundberg which would not require Ms. McCartie to open her house to strangers. I conclude that such was the mode of production required by the statute in the circumstances.\n[19] Mr. McFadgen cited no authority in support of his third point, and I have found none which discusses when a warrant may be said to have been \u201cexecuted\u201d. None of the dictionaries which I have consulted offer enlightenment.\n[20] In Bohn at paragraph 31, Justice Ryan quoted the following passage with approval:\nThe reason for the requirement that an officer executing the warrant have it available for production, is to allow the occupant of the searched premises to know: (1) why the search is being carried out, so as to enable the occupant to properly assess his or her legal position; and (2) that there is, at least, a colour of authority for the search and that forcible resistance is improper. This last rationale also plays a role in the second procedural requirement for a valid search, that the peace officers announce themselves before entering the premises to be searched.\nThose objectives would be rendered entirely moot if the occupant is not entitled to see the warrant before the searchers cross the threshold. Once the searchers enter the home, the violation of privacy has already occurred and the opportunity to resist an unauthorized intrusion has passed. The purpose of section 29(1) is to entitle the occupant of a house to satisfy herself as to the searcher\u2019s legal authority to enter the house before the occupant is obliged to allow the searcher to enter. The section is perfectly clear. The occupant is not required to accept the searcher\u2019s assertion that she has a warrant and a right to enter. The occupant is entitled to demand production of the warrant, as Ms. McCartie did.\n[21] Section 29(1) imposes a production obligation on a class of persons; i.e. those who execute warrants. That, in itself, does not tell us when such persons must produce the warrant. The time is determined by the final phrase of section 29(1); i.e. \u201c\u2026 when requested to do so\u201d. Ms. Sundberg was plainly a person who executed a warrant. While she was in the course of doing so, Ms. McCartie asked her to produce the warrant. Applying the plain words of the section, Ms. Sundberg was obliged to do so when the request was made. I do not say that a person executing a warrant must always respond instantly to a request for production. Circumstances may render it impracticable to do so. However, the person must comply with the request as soon as it is practicable to do so. In this case, as noted above, it would have been perfectly practicable for Ms. Sundberg to do so immediately upon Ms. McCartie\u2019s first request.\n[22] I conclude that, in this case, Ms. Sundberg failed to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code.\n(Emphasis added)\n[72] Judge Gouge went on to conclude that this was a breach of Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights:\n[23] Section 8 of the Charter provides:\nEveryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\nAs noted above, in Bohn, Justice Ryan said at paragraph 34:\nFailure to produce the warrant on request, without good reason, is in my view, a significant breach of s. 8.\nI am bound to follow that direction unless it has subsequently been overruled by the Supreme Court of Canada. In R vs Patrick 2007 ABCA 308; [2007] AJ No. 1130; [2008] 1 WWR 600; 227 CCC (3d) 525, Justice Ritter said at paragraph 49:\nI do not agree with the analysis in Bohn that failure to comply with s. 29 of the Criminal Code necessarily creates a s. 8 Charter breach. What is protected are unreasonable searches, which depends the reasonableness of the police's grounds after authorization by a judicial officer, rather than procedural niceties.\nJustice Ritter\u2019s judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada: 2009 SCC 17 (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 579. However, the point under discussion here is not mentioned in the Supreme Court of Canada judgment. The basis of the majority judgment was stated by Justice Binnie in the following terms at paragraph 73:\n\u2026 I agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal majority in this case that the appellant had abandoned his privacy interest in the contents of the garbage bags gathered up by the police when he placed them in the garbage alcove open to the laneway ready for collection. The taking by the police did not constitute a search and seizure within the scope of s. 8, and the evidence (as well as the fruits of the search warrant obtained in reliance on such evidence) was properly admissible.\nThat being so, I cannot conclude that, in Patrick, the Supreme Court of Canada overruled Bohn, and I am bound to apply Bohn in this case. I note also that Bohn was followed, on this point, in R vs Fan 2013 BCSC 1406; [2013] BCJ No. 1710 at paragraphs 70 - 74, and that Fan is also an authority binding upon me.\n[24] Accordingly, I am bound to conclude that Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code infringed Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 8 of the Charter, unless the evidence discloses a \u201cgood reason\u201d for that failure. In paragraph 12, above, I identified the reasons given by Ms. Sundberg. In paragraphs 13 - 21, I explained why those were not good reasons. I do not think that they justify her failure to comply with section 29(1).\n[25] As no good reason has been established for Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code, it follows that her conduct infringed Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 8 of the Charter.\n[73] While the Tax Court is not so strictly bound by the BC Court of Appeal, I will not, and have not been asked to, revisit Judge Gouge\u2019s finding of a breach of Ms. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights for any reason. The principals of judicial comity, deference and common sense apply here. As the home was also Mr. McCartie\u2019s home, and housed his property, I accept that his section 8 Charter rights against unreasonable search or seizure were also breached by this squad of CRA Criminal Investigations and RCMP that morning. I was not asked to do otherwise.\n[74] As noted below in McCartie 2015-4, Judge Gouge found that the execution of the search warrant was also a breach of Mr. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights. Also, as noted below in McCartie 2015-4, Judge Gouge quashed the search warrant itself, further rendering the search and seizure to be unlawful and a section 8 Charter breach.\n(vii) McCartie 2015 BCPC 254 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-4\u201d) [75] In this decision, Judge Gouge was dealing with the McCarties\u2019 request for an order excluding certain documents seized from their home under the authority of the search warrant described above. This is the search and seizure found by Judge Gouge in McCartie 2015-3 to have been unreasonable. The exclusion of the seized documents is the remedy that the McCarties both sought as appropriate and just under section 24 of the Charter for the breach of their Charter rights under section 8. Judge Gouge begins by pointing out, very correctly, that he is deciding this in the context of the McCarties\u2019 criminal trial and that the legal principals governing the exclusion of evidence in criminal proceedings differ in some respects from those applicable in civil proceedings for the collection of taxes and civil penalties from the McCarties. He is clear that he expresses no opinion in relation to the admissibility of evidence in any civil proceeding in this Court.\n[76] In his Background, Judge Gouge wrote:\n[4] On a previous application, Mr. & Ms. McCartie sought a judicial stay of this prosecution, on the ground that CRA had infringed their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms by exercising CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers to compel Mr. & Ms. McCartie to disclose information to CRA at a time when CRA\u2019s predominant purpose was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution: R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757. In order to decide that application, it would be necessary to determine the date on which CRA\u2019s predominant objective changed from a civil audit to a criminal prosecution. I was unable to determine that date because: (i) some of CRA\u2019s internal documents have been lost; (ii) some CRA employees omitted to create other documents, which they would normally have prepared and which would have provided insight into CRA\u2019s motives and objectives from time to time. As a result, the Charter breach alleged by Mr. & Ms. McCartie was not proven. However, I concluded that, unless an appropriate remedy were granted, the loss of some CRA documents, and the omission to create others, would result in a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s right (under section 11(d) of the Charter) to a fair trial. In order to prevent that Charter breach, I ordered that the documents procured by CRA during its audit be excluded from evidence: R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No.636.\n[5] It should be noted that I did not conclude that the loss of some CRA documents, or the omission to create other CRA documents, was a breach of the Charter. Rather, I concluded that: (i) those events would result in an unfair trial unless the evidence procured during the audit were excluded from the trial; and (ii) an accused person has a right to a fair trial whether or not the impediment to a fair trial arises from Crown misconduct. The order which I made was a prophylactic against an imminent Charter breach, rather than a remedy for a Charter breach which had previously occurred.[9]\n[6] Mr. & Ms. McCartie then applied to quash the search warrant, on the ground that much of the evidence described in the information to obtain (\u201cthe ITO\u201d) had been procured by CRA during the civil audit. On the hearing of that application, Mr. McFadgen, for the Crown, very properly conceded that all of the evidence procured during the civil audit should be redacted from the ITO, and that the question on the application was whether a search warrant could properly have been issued on the basis of the redacted ITO. Mr. McFadgen and Mr. & Ms. McCarty were able to agree on the appropriate redactions, and presented me with a redacted ITO for consideration. It was immediately apparent that no search warrant could properly have been issued on the basis of the redacted ITO, and I quashed the warrant for that reason.[10]\n[7] Ms. McCartie then applied for a declaration that CRA had infringed her Charter rights because, when CRA investigators attended at the McCartie home to execute the warrant, they refused her request for production of the warrant before they entered her home. I concluded that Ms. McCartie\u2019s complaint was well-founded, and granted the declaration which she sought: R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 233. Mr. Jones, for the Crown, concedes that Mr. McCartie is entitled to the same declaration because, although he was not at home at the time of the search, his Charter-protected privacy rights in his home were infringed by the refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request.\n[8] Two breaches of section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms have been established:\na. The consequence of my decision to quash the search warrant is that the search of the McCartie home was not authorized by law. A search which is not authorized by law is an unreasonable search: R vs Klimchuk 1991 CanLII 3958 (BC CA), [1991] BCJ No. 2872; 67 CCC (3d) 385.\nb. The refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request for production of the search warrant before the investigators entered the house was, itself, a breach of section 8: R vs Bohn [2000] BCJ No. 867; 2000 BCCA 239; 145 CCC (3d) 320.\nThe question on the present application is whether the appropriate remedy for those breaches is to exclude from evidence the documents seized by CRA during the search.\n(Emphasis added)\n[77] Note there is not a published decision, nor was I provided with the transcript of Judge Gouge\u2019s decision to quash the search warrant. Therefore I am left uninformed of the reasons the Crown \"very properly conceded that all of the evidence provided procured during the civil audit should be redacted\" from the Information To Obtain (\u201cITO\u201d) for the search warrant was because of the unresolved Key Date issue, which prevented the Crown from establishing that the evidence was properly collected. Given Judge Gouge\u2019s very serious remedy of quashing the search warrant, I infer that there were significant concerns, including potentially from his in camera hearing on the informer tip and the Key Date, with accepting that the evidence to date established that CRA Criminal Investigations had not yet started looking for evidence for prosecution.\n[78] Section 24(2) of the Charter requires exclusion of evidence obtained in breach of one\u2019s Charter rights if it established that, having regard to all the circumstances, its admission in court proceedings, would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\n[79] Judge Gouge described the principles governing such a determination as follows:\n[10] The governing principles were summarized in R vs Grant 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] 2 SCR 353 @ paragraphs 67 \u2013 71 (underlining added):\nThe words of s. 24(2) capture its purpose: to maintain the good repute of the administration of justice. The term \"administration of justice\" is often used to indicate the processes by which those who break the law are investigated, charged and tried. More broadly, however, the term embraces maintaining the rule of law and upholding Charter rights in the justice system as a whole.\nThe phrase \"bring the administration of justice into disrepute\" must be understood in the long-term sense of maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system. Exclusion of evidence resulting in an acquittal may provoke immediate criticism. But s. 24(2) does not focus on immediate reaction to the individual case. Rather, it looks to whether the overall repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term, will be adversely affected by admission of the evidence. The inquiry is objective. It asks whether a reasonable person, informed of all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the Charter, would conclude that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\nSection 24(2)'s focus is not only long-term, but prospective. The fact of the Charter breach means damage has already been done to the administration of justice. Section 24(2) starts from that proposition and seeks to ensure that evidence obtained through that breach does not do further damage to the repute of the justice system.\nFinally, s. 24(2)'s focus is societal. Section 24(2) is not aimed at punishing the police or providing compensation to the accused, but rather at systemic concerns. The s. 24(2) focus is on the broad impact of admission of the evidence on the long-term repute of the justice system.\n(Emphasis added)\nA review of the authorities suggests that whether the admission of evidence obtained in breach of the Charter would bring the administration of justice into disrepute engages three avenues of inquiry, each rooted in the public interests engaged by s. 24(2), viewed in a long-term, forward-looking and societal perspective. When faced with an application for exclusion under s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society's confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct (admission may send the message the justice system condones serious state misconduct), (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights count for little), and (3) society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. The court's role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. (Underlined by Judge Gouge)\n[80] Judge Gouge went on to consider these three lines of inquiry:\nThe Three Lines of Enquiry\nThe Seriousness of CRA\u2019s Conduct\n[11] In Grant at paragraphs 72 - 75, Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Charron said:\nThe first line of inquiry relevant to the s. 24(2) analysis requires a court to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct. The more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to the Charter violation, the greater the need for the courts to dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence to the rule of law.\n\u2026\nState conduct resulting in Charter violations varies in seriousness. At one end of the spectrum, admission of evidence obtained through inadvertent or minor violations of the Charter may minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law. At the other end of the spectrum, admitting evidence obtained through a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights will inevitably have a negative effect on the public confidence in the rule of law, and risk bringing the administration of justice into disrepute.\n\u2026\n\"Good faith\" on the part of the police will also reduce the need for the court to disassociate itself from the police conduct. However, ignorance of Charter standards must not be rewarded or encouraged and negligence or wilful blindness cannot be equated with good faith \u2026.\n[12] Mr. Jones and Mr. McFadgen urge me to conclude that the CRA investigators proceeded in good faith; i.e. in the belief that they had a valid warrant and that they were not obliged to produce the warrant until they had executed it by crossing the threshold of the McCartie home. \u201cGood faith\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d are polar ends of a spectrum. In placing particular police conduct in that spectrum, it is necessary to consider whether a police officer\u2019s belief that she was acting lawfully was reasonable: R vs Caron 2011 BCCA 56; [2011] BCJ No. 200; 269 CCC (3d) 15 @ paragraphs 38 - 42.\n[13] I accept that this was not a case in which the CRA investigators who executed the search warrant deliberately disregarded Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. The investigators honestly believed that they were entitled to proceed as they did.\n[14] I think that the individual CRA investigators\u2019 belief that the warrant was valid was a reasonable belief. The individual investigators had no reason to doubt the validity of the warrant.\n[15] However, that factor is somewhat attenuated by the Jarvis issue.\n[16] In this case, there is evidence capable of supporting the inference that CRA used its audit powers to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. I discussed the evidence which supports that inference in two previous decisions in this case: R vs McCartie 2014 BCPC 128; [2014] BCJ No. 1227; R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No. 636.\n[17] The question whether, in this case, CRA deliberately used its audit powers to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution cannot be answered because relevant documents have been lost and others which would have been created in the ordinary course of CRA\u2019s business were not created in this case. CRA has not explained the loss of the documents or the omission to create others. For a more detailed exposition of that point, see R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No. 636 @ paragraphs 4 - 32. When I asked Mr. McFadgen for an explanation during the course of that hearing, he replied that \u201c\u2026 the explanation is that the notes were lost\u201d. I have been provided with no information about the efforts, if any, which CRA has made to investigate how records came to be lost or why others, which would normally have been prepared, were not prepared in this case. CRA\u2019s reticence on the issue of the missing documents renders it difficult to assess its corporate good (or bad) faith. I find that regrettable, because a candid explanation from CRA might have done much to encourage public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the system.\n[18] I do not think that the individual investigators\u2019 refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s demand for production of the warrant was reasonable. The investigators\u2019 position was \u201clet us in and we will show you the warrant\u201d. That position was plainly unreasonable. The obvious purpose of section 29(1) of the Criminal Code is to empower the homeowner to demand to see the legal authority for the search before allowing anyone to enter her home.\n[19] I would not describe either of the two Charter breaches in issue as \u201cinadvertent or minor\u201d. Overall, I would assess the state of mind of the individual investigators who executed the search warrant in this case as being toward the \u201cgood faith\u201d end of the spectrum, but not far from the centre.\nThe Impact of the Breach on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused\n[20] CRA conducted a search of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s home which was not authorized by law. During the search of the home, CRA seized, and subsequently searched, Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s computers. In R vs Morelli 2010 SCC 8 (CanLII), [2010] 1 SCR 253 @ paragraph 105, Justice Fish said that \u201c\u2026 it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer \u2026\u201d. I think it necessary to acknowledge that there are a number of types of bodily searches, commonly conducted by police officers, which are more intrusive than a search of a home or personal computer. With that acknowledged, a search of a person\u2019s home or personal computer is a very serious matter.\n[81] Judge Gouge included passages from R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627, including:\n[21] Mr. McFadgen urged me to take into account the following observation of Justice Reilly in R vs Dial Drug Stores Limited 2003 CanLII 23014 (ON SC), [2003] OJ No. 754; 63 OR (2d) 529:\nWith respect to the consequences related to s. 8 of the Charter, McKinlay Transport, supra, makes it clear that taxpayers have very little privacy interest in the materials and records that they are obliged to keep under the [Income Tax Act] and that they are obliged to produce during an audit.\nHowever, it is important to note that the judgment in R. McKinlay Transport 1990 CanLII 137 (SCC), [1990] 1 SCR 627, to which Justice Reilly referred, was not concerned with a criminal investigation, but rather with CRA\u2019s powers to compel production of documents in the exercise of its civil audit powers. At paragraphs 32 - 34 of McKinlay Transport, Justice Wilson said (underlining added):\nAt the beginning of my analysis I noted that the Income Tax Act was based on the principle of self-reporting and self-assessment. The Act could have provided that each taxpayer submit all his or her records to the Minister and his officials so that they might make the calculations necessary for determining each person's taxable income. The legislation does not so provide, no doubt because it would be extremely expensive and cumbersome to operate such a system. However, a self-reporting system has its drawbacks. Chief among these is that it depends for its success upon the taxpayers' honesty and integrity in preparing their returns. While most taxpayers undoubtedly respect and comply with the system, the facts of life are that certain persons will attempt to take advantage of the system and avoid their full tax liability.\nAccordingly, the Minister of National Revenue must be given broad powers in supervising this regulatory scheme to audit taxpayers' returns and inspect all records which may be relevant to the preparation of these returns. The Minister must be capable of exercising these powers whether or not he has reasonable grounds for believing that a particular taxpayer has breached the Act. Often it will be impossible to determine from the face of the return whether any impropriety has occurred in its preparation. A spot check or a system of random monitoring may be the only way in which the integrity of the tax system can be maintained. If this is the case, and I believe that it is, then it is evident that the Hunter criteria are ill-suited to determine whether a seizure under s. 231(3) of the Income Tax Act is reasonable. The regulatory nature of the legislation and the scheme enacted require otherwise. The need for random monitoring is incompatible with the requirement in Hunter that the person seeking authorization for a search or seizure have reasonable and probable grounds, established under oath, to believe that an offence has been committed. If this Hunter criterion is inapplicable, then so too must the remaining Hunter criteria since they all depend for their vitality upon the need to establish reasonable and probable grounds. For example, there is no need for an impartial arbiter capable of acting judicially since his central role under Hunter is to ensure that the person seeking the authorization has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a particular offence has been committed, that there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the authorization will turn up something relating to that particular offence, and that the authorization only goes so far as to allow the seizure of documents relevant to that particular offence.\nThis is not to say that any and all forms of search and seizure under the Income Tax Act are valid. The state interest in monitoring compliance with the legislation must be weighed against an individual's privacy interest. The greater the intrusion into the privacy interests of an individual, the more likely it will be that safeguards akin to those in Hunter will be required. Thus, when the tax officials seek entry onto the private property of an individual to conduct a search or seizure, the intrusion is much greater than a mere demand for production of documents. (Emphasis added). The reason for this is that, while a taxpayer may have little expectation of privacy in relation to his business records relevant to the determination of his tax liability, he has a significant privacy interest in the inviolability of his home. (underlined by Judge Gouge)\nTwo conclusions flow from this passage:\na. Different legal principles apply, and different public-policy issues arise, when CRA is pursuing a criminal investigation than when it is conducting a civil audit.\nb. Even when CRA is conducting a civil audit, different legal principles apply, and different public-policy issues arise, when CRA seeks to enter a private dwelling without the consent of the occupier.\n(Emphasis added)\nI conclude that Justice Reilly\u2019s comments in Dial Drug Stores are of limited, if any, application where CRA is conducting a criminal investigation, or where it seeks to enter a private dwelling without the consent of the occupier.\n[82] McKinlay was only concerned with seizure in civil tax collection proceedings. In the McCarties\u2019 case, the issue arises, as is often the case, in both their tax evasion investigation and civil tax and penalties audit. These were so intertwined by CRA that Criminal Investigations took over the audits and issued the reassessments. It can be noted that the Crown has the burden of proof in both tax evasion and civil penalties proceedings, albeit to different standards, as compared with the burden of proof with respect to the correctness of the amount of tax in dispute in this Court. (The Crown also has the burden in this proceeding on the statute-barred years.)\n[83] It can also be noted that the BC Court found two section 8 Charter breaches; section 8 Charter breaches, unlike sections 7 and 11, are not limited to criminal and penal proceedings.\n[84] Judge Gouge went on to consider the fact that Mr. McCartie\u2019s business records were also stored at their home and wrote:\n[22] Mr. McFadgen points out that the CRA investigators had received information to the effect that Mr. McCartie carried on business from his home. He relies on R vs Roy 2010 BCCA 448; [2010] BCJ No. 1999; 261 CCC (3d) 62 in support of the proposition that a person who carries on business from his home has a lesser expectation of privacy in his home than a person who uses his home solely as a residence. I accept that proposition in relation to home businesses which invite the public to attend at the home for the purpose of transacting business: R vs Contant 2008 QCCA 2514; 253 CCC (3d) 259. However, there is no indication in the evidence that Mr. or Ms. McCartie did so. There are many home businesses which do not invite their customers, or other members of the public, to attend at the residence. Mr. McCartie\u2019s business may have been one of those. In such circumstances, I do not think that the home\/business owner is entitled to any lesser expectation of privacy than anyone else.\n[23] The refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request for production of the warrant had a less serious impact on the privacy rights of Mr. & Ms. McCartie [than the warrantless search and seizure at their home]. However, a Charter breach of that kind was described as \u201csignificant\u201d in Bohn @ paragraph 34. I observe that it has had a material impact on Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s sense of personal security. Simply put, they feel less safe in their home than they did before the search. That is an interest which the Charter seeks to protect.\n(Emphasis added)\n[85] Judge Gouge\u2019s overall assessment was:\n[24] Overall, I would assess the impact of the two Charter breaches in question as, cumulatively, very serious.\n(Emphasis added)\n[86] I believe Canadian taxpayers and benefit recipients can, understandably, be expected to have heightened concerns about their privacy in their own home when CRA and RCMP breached their obligation to produce a copy of the warrant and literally threaten to break down their front door. The fact the search warrant was obtained on the basis of information that should not have been in CRA\u2019s ITO for the warrant can only be expected to add to Canadians\u2019 concerns.\n[87] With respect to the third consideration, Judge Gouge noted:\nSociety\u2019s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits\n[25] This issue is particularly difficult where the offence alleged is tax evasion. Most Canadians accurately report their income and expenses, and voluntarily pay the tax which they owe. They do that because they believe that the overwhelming majority of their fellow citizens do the same. Canadians have observed the very grave consequences which have ensued in some other countries, in which the citizens have lost confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration. Once that confidence is lost, tax evasion becomes commonplace (because individual citizens\u2019 willingness to pay their fair share depends largely on their belief that others do the same), government revenues fall dramatically and a fiscal crisis ensues. Canada has avoided such consequences, at least in part, because most Canadians are confident that both the tax system and its enforcement are fair and reasonable. The maintenance of that public confidence depends on two factors:\na. CRA must diligently and vigorously pursue tax evaders. Public confidence in the fairness of the system depends, in part, on public confidence that those who do not pay their fair share will be identified, relentlessly pursued and appropriately sanctioned.\nb. CRA must proceed fairly and lawfully in its dealings with taxpayers, including those suspected of tax evasion. One cannot maintain public confidence in the fairness of a system if those charged with enforcement of the system conduct themselves unlawfully or unfairly. (Emphasis added)\nThe question is whether, in this case, a greater risk to public confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration would arise from: (i) excluding the evidence, with the attendant risk that the public will perceive that an evader escaped appropriate sanctions; or (ii) admitting the evidence, with the attendant risk that the public will perceive that the court is unwilling to require CRA to comply with applicable laws, designed to protect individual rights from government intrusion.\n[26] At paragraph 83 of Grant, Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Charron said that the \u201c\u2026 importance of the evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case is another factor that may be considered in this line of enquiry\u201d (underlining added). Mr. McFadgen and Mr. Jones inform me that the evidence seized from the McCartie home is of critical importance to the Crown\u2019s case, and that an order for the exclusion of that evidence will probably put an end to this prosecution. Mr. & Ms. McCartie agree that the evidence is very important. It seems to me that this is a knife which cuts two ways. I have in mind that the objective of the enquiry is to reach a result which fosters public confidence in the process. On the one hand, the fact that the evidence is strongly incriminating would cause public concern that its exclusion might allow tax evaders to escape punishment. On the other hand, the significance of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s privacy interest is directly proportional to the importance of the documents seized from them.\n(Emphasis added)\n[88] Judge Gouge\u2019s conclusion is:\nConclusion on the Three Lines of Enquiry\n[27] After careful reflection, I think that receipt of the evidence seized under the search warrant would pose a greater risk of injury to public confidence in the administration of justice and the fairness of the tax system than its exclusion. Applying Grant, I must therefore exclude the evidence.\n[28] Ms. Sundberg, CRA\u2019s lead investigator in this case, acknowledged that, without the documents procured during the audit process, she would have had no reasonable grounds upon which to apply for a search warrant, and would not have done so. If it were proven that CRA procured the audit documents in breach of the constraint imposed by Jarvis, it would be necessary to consider whether the principle of derivative use immunity would support exclusion of the documents seized under the search warrant: R vs RJS 1995 CanLII 121 (SCC), [1995] 1 SCR 451 @ paragraphs 160 - 204. Unless Mr. & Ms. McCartie can prove that CRA misused its audit powers, the question of derivative use immunity does not arise. The loss of CRA\u2019s internal documents, and the omission to create others, is a material impediment to the presentation of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s case on the issue of derivative use immunity.\n[29] By its unexplained and unjustified conduct in relation to its internal documents, CRA has materially impaired Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s ability to defend the charges made against them. The right to a fair trial is both guaranteed by section 11(d) the Charter and fundamental to the preservation of public confidence in the fairness of the justice system: R vs Collins 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 SCR 265 @ paragraph 36. A fair trial of tax evasion cases is also fundamental to the preservation of public confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration.\n[30] Neither a judicial stay of the prosecution nor an order to exclude evidence should be granted if a lesser remedy would suffice to ensure a fair trial: R vs O\u2019Connor [1995] 4 SCR 651 @ pages 465-466; R vs Bjelland 2009 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2009] 2 SCR 651 @ paragraph 19. In this case, a judicial stay of the prosecution is not necessary for that purpose, but an order for exclusion of the evidence seized under the authority of the search warrant is.\nDisposition\n[31] The documents seized under the authority of the search warrant will be excluded from evidence at this trial.\nV. Summary of the BC Court\u2019s Charter breach findings and remedies [89] In summary Judge Gouge found one section 7 breach and two section 8 breaches, as well as a section 11 breach if he allowed the trial to continue and not stay the proceeding. His remedies for the sections 7 and 8 breaches were to exclude evidence from the home and the computers and to exclude evidence from CRA\u2019s second audit.\n[90] In McCartie 2015-2 the BC Court found that CRA\u2019s failures to make notes, and to retain the notes that were made, denied the McCarties the right to a fair trial. A fair hearing is enshrined in section 11 of the Charter. The BC Court also found that the McCarties\u2019 rights under section 7 of the Charter had been breached by CRA\u2019s unacceptably negligent loss of the Coles Notes.[11] The remedy imposed by the BC Court was to exclude from evidence all documents procured by CRA exercising its statutory power as part of the second audit \u2014 i.e. the audit giving rise to the reassessments in dispute in this Court.\n[91] In McCartie 2015-3 and 2015-4 the BC Court found that the failure by the CRA Investigators to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code regarding the production of a copy of a search warrant when asked was a significant breach of section 8 of the Charter regarding unreasonable search or seizure.\n[92] In McCartie 2015-4 the BC Court threw out the search warrant for the search of the McCarties\u2019 home as the ITO could not support the search warrant being issued without the evidence obtained by CRA during the second audit. The resulting warrantless search was another breach of the McCarties\u2019 section 8 Charter rights. The BC Court completed its detailed Grant analysis for both of these section 8 breaches which it described as cumulatively very serious breaches. The section 24 remedy imposed in the BC Court\u2019s proceeding for these two section 8 breaches was to exclude from evidence in that proceeding evidence seized from their home.\nVI. This Voir Dire Proceeding Witness testimony\n[93] Mr. McCartie was the only witness for the appellant in this hearing. As stated above, he only testified to, and was cross-examined on, facts relevant to this stage of the proceeding, and not on the substantive issues applicable to the several penalties assessed under the ITA and GST\/HST provisions, the statute-barred years, or the substantive tax issues.\n[94] The respondent called three witnesses from CRA. The Auditor Ms. Coles, the Auditor Mr. McLachlan to whom the audit file was transferred in 2009, and Mr. Alan Jones, the Team Leader heading Criminal Investigations in Vancouver at the time. Their testimony covered both the evidentiary and procedural aspects of the voir dire, and, as described above, the respondent\u2019s witnesses\u2019 evidence on the substantive merits of the penalties assessed and in dispute in this appeal, along with the substantive tax issues including the statute-barred years. The respondent also called Dr. Angelina Loo, an orthodontist who was one of the persons to whom Mr. McCartie provided services for which he billed and was paid. Virtually all of Dr. Loo\u2019s evidence pertained to the substantive merits of this appeal.\n[95] As noted by Judge Gouge, Mr. McLachlan\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the issues before the BC Court, as he took over the audit in 2009. Similarly, it is of little direct relevance in this voir dire.\n[96] It should also be noted that Mr. Brown, the auditor who completed the earlier audit of the McCarties, transferred to Criminal Investigations, and then returned to Audit from Criminal Investigations to recommend the audits in question leading to the referral to Criminal Investigations, did not testify. As I wrote above with respect to Ms. Sundberg, I will regard Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence in the BC Court and what that court wrote about it, as the most favorable version of events from the respondent\u2019s point of view and from Mr. Brown\u2019s. I also accept Judge Gouge\u2019s assessment of his testimony and I share his doubts about it.\n(i) Mr. McCartie\u2019s evidence [97] Mr. McCartie described the first audit of 2002 and 2003 by Mr. Brown. He noted that Mr. Brown\u2019s penalty report was approved by his Team Leader Mr. Lidster. The McCarties filed objections to the 2002-2003 reassessments, which were largely allowed. Penalties were withdrawn and most of the denied expenses, hundred of thousands of dollars, were allowed by CRA Appeals.\n[98] Mr. McCartie explained that Mr. Brown\u2019s audit led to liens being placed upon their home, even before the reassessments were issued, which in turn led to his bankruptcy.\n[99] Mr. Brown recommended the second audit on November 21, 2007, which is almost immediately upon returning to Audit from Criminal Investigations. Mr. Brown\u2019s T134[12] was accepted by Criminal Investigations for \u201cfull scale\u201d Investigation by Ms. Sundberg.\n[100] During the second audit, at a November 27, 2008 meeting with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar, the McCarties were asked by Mr. Lecznar about their beliefs regarding natural persons and their beliefs about paying income tax. These questions made Mr. McCartie uncomfortable and suspicious of Mr. Lecznar\u2019s motives and purposes for asking such questions as they did not seem consistent with an audit verification of income, expenses, deductions etc., but were about his personal thinking, opinion and belief. He found Mr. Lecznar\u2019s questions were more focussed on an intention to not pay taxes.\n[101] Mr. McCartie said that he and his wife felt compelled to provide some cancelled cheques and invoices (that his wife had partially redacted) at the audit meeting. While asked for, they were also told that they would be compelled by written requirements to if they didn\u2019t provide them. The questionnaire they were asked to fill out also went beyond questions about the records required to be kept under the ITA and GST legislation.\n[102] In December 2008 Ms. Coles and her Team Leader Mr. Lidster met to issue the bank requirements.\n[103] There was a letter to Ms. Coles called a Statement of Facts that purported to be from Mr. McCartie. Mr. McCartie denies sending it, does not know who did, and was unaware of it prior to its production on discovery in the BC Court proceedings. I have no reason at this stage not to believe that, having heard from all of the respondent\u2019s witnesses. If it turns out Mr. McCartie did send it or authorize it to be sent, it would be a voluntary document and there will be no reason for its exclusion on Charter grounds. Its provenance and its relevance can be ultimately determined at the trial stage. For purposes of this voir dire, I accept his explanation.\n[104] Mr. McCartie acknowledged in cross-examination that a Mr. Ho of Paradigm Education attended one of the McCarties\u2019 meetings with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar. Ms. McCartie invited Mr. Ho to observe the meeting and he did not participate. This is not relevant to the Charter issues. Suffice it to say CRA believed both McCarties were de-taxers making natural person claims, and that was based in part on Mr. McCartie having attended some Paradigm seminars, and a Paradigm official attending the one audit meeting as described. In addition, Mr. McCartie signed a $4,800 contract for services to be provided by Mr. Ho or by Paradigm (though Mr. McCartie says it should have only said Mr. Ho) as educator to tutor Mr. McCartie on the Charter and the Bill of Rights. This is one of the documents that were seized by CRA when the McCarties\u2019 home was searched.\n[105] Mr. McCartie testified that Ms. McCartie let Criminal Investigations and RCMP in the house before she left on the day they searched the McCarties\u2019 home. However, Mr. McCartie was not present at that time. He said he wasn\u2019t sure and did not know for certain. Judge Gouge\u2019s decisions do not mention this and it would have been relevant to what he was deciding. I conclude Mr. McCartie is wrong on this point and I accept that Ms. McCartie left the home before the RCMP and CRA chose to enter after she and her daughter left.\n[106] I do have some credibility concerns with Mr. McCartie saying that his tutoring by Mr. Ho was separate from Mr. Ho\u2019s role at Paradigm. I note this even though the courses are not relevant at this stage. I do not have credibility concerns on matters that are relevant at this stage.\n[107] I also have some reliability concerns that on several occasions Mr. McCartie was very categorical and certain about some things that, when presented with evidence to the contrary, he had to acknowledge he should have been less certain about than he had been.\n[108] The issue of Mr. Ho not Paradigm being the tutor under contract as educator is not one that Mr. McCartie would back down from, even when faced with questions from me and in cross-examination asking why his contract with Mr. Ho referred to Paradigm a number of times, and each page of the contract was printed on Paradigm letterhead with Paradigm footers and described their standard payment plans as a percentage of the tax savings.\n(ii) Annette Coles\u2019 evidence [109] Ms. Coles has a CPA designation and is a team leader in Audit at CRA. She had been an auditor in the years in question, having started at CRA as an auditor in 2005. Ms. Coles has never worked in Criminal Investigations.\n[110] Ms. Coles testified that she issued the Requests for Information \u201cRFIs\u201d to the financial institutions since that is the normal step to follow when unable to obtain all of the information from taxpayers directly.\n[111] She had no involvement in the decision to refer the audit file to Criminal Investigations, and no involvement with what was referred to Criminal Investigations or what documents Audit made available to Criminal Investigations.\n[112] Ms. Coles transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan when she was transferred within Audit from General Income Tax Audit to GST Refunds Return Audits. At the time she transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan she had not come to any conclusion regarding the audit as it was still very much in the information gathering stages. She had not used or relied on any banking information and records to come to any decision or conclusion about Mr. McCartie\u2019s income.\n[113] Ms. Coles confirmed that the lost Coles\u2019 Notes would have included her detailed chronology of the steps she took and the events that occurred in the course of the audits she was attending to.\n(iii) Mr. McLachlan\u2019s evidence [114] Mr. McLachlan has been with CRA for over 30 years as an Excise Tax auditor throughout, which included some responsibilities as a generalist in Tax and in GST Audit. He did not complete the CGA program he started in the 1970s.\n[115] Mr. McLachlan confirmed that the audit files were transferred to him in 2009. He said that he can not recall why the McCarties were selected for audit. As part of the McCarties\u2019 audits that he took over from Ms. Coles, he reviewed Mr. Brown\u2019s earlier audit of 2002-2003. He started work on it around June of 2009 a few months after it was transferred to him. He worked about 200 hours on the file before the March 2010 referral by him and his team leader to Criminal Investigations. After completing his review of Ms. Coles\u2019 file at that time, he came to \u201can inconclusive conclusion\u201d as there were many items in the bankruptcy that CRA could not explain. He never contacted or dealt with Mr. McCartie during the audit. He processed the file as transferred to him by Ms. Coles along with any records received from the banks to the RFIs that were received thereafter. He said that he does not particularly recall why the audit was transferred to Criminal Investigations even though he was the person who recommended to his team leader that it be transferred to Criminal Investigations.\n[116] Mr. McLachlan said he does not know what documents were taken from the searching and seizure of his desk. He was working from home at that stage. He said he does not know why his desk was searched. He said this was the only time in his CRA career that he had a search of his desk or anything seized from his files.\n[117] Mr. McLachlan does not recall if the Laurentian and ResMor bank records were received in response to an RFI sent by Ms. Coles. He testified that they could have been seized from Ms. McCartie\u2019s computer at the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. Mr. McLachlan said he did not rely on them as part of his audits. He did not think they were relevant so they did not go in the audit file, but would have remained at his desk awaiting shredding at the completion of the audits but for the seizure. He testified documents received from taxpayers or others that an auditor does not think are relevant (even if a taxpayer does) do not get placed in the audit file but are kept separately \u201con hold\u201d and shredded at the conclusion of the audit. CRA audit procedures required that anything relevant to the assessment in the audit be inserted in the Audit package, and nothing more. The relevance of documents for these purposes is determined by the auditor who may find to be irrelevant documents that are provided by or on behalf of a taxpayer who believes they are relevant. It should have been described in the T-2020. Mr. McLachlan\u2019s working papers and summaries of unreported income, allow for expenses and GST payable on those expenses. They were based entirely on the RFIs and documents received in response to them. His summaries were forwarded to Criminal Investigations along with anything Ms. Coles may have prepared when she worked the file.\n[118] The only expenses Mr. McLachlan allowed in his audit work were those documented by cheques drawn on the CIBC account, and not any that might have been payed otherwise or by cheque on another of the McCarties\u2019 banks to which CRA had issued RFIs. Mr. McLachlan agreed that Mr. McCartie was correct that this was \u201can incomplete audit\u201d and CRA had not accounted for expenses to the full extend audit procedures provided for.\n(iv) Angelina Loo\u2019s evidence [119] Dr. Loo is an orthodontist. She met Mr. McCartie when they both attended the same \u201ccourse\u201d on natural persons. Sometime after that, Dr. Loo hired Mr. McCartie to design her practice\u2019s website for a fixed fee.\n[120] Dr. Loo was later contacted by Ms. Sundberg of Criminal Investigations to obtain copies of the invoice she received for that work along with her cheque by which she paid it. Dr. Loo provided these. Other evidence confirms that these were used by Criminal Investigations in its investigation prior to the assessments in question being issued by Criminal Investigations.\n[121] I see no reason on these facts to consider excluding the documents obtained by CRA from Dr. Loo from being relied on by the respondent in this proceeding.\n(v) Alan Jones\u2019 evidence [122] Mr. Jones is a CPA and has worked at CRA for over 20 years. In the period in question, he was the team leader of Criminal Investigations in Vancouver. He had been in Criminal Investigations since 2002 and was its team leader since 2005. Mr. Jones explained that in about 75% of cases, an investigation starts with a referral from Audit.\n[123] He was the team leader for the McCarties\u2019 audits and Ms. Sundberg was the lead investigator. He would have reviewed all of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s working papers and any reports she would have prepared. He gave Ms. Sundberg guidance on the investigation. He had regular meetings with her regarding the investigation\u2019s direction and progress.\n[124] All six of the senior Investigators reported to him and he oversaw their work and all of their investigations. He was involved in reviewing all of their work including primary reports, ITOs, search warrants, audit reports and prosecution reports. He reviewed everything that came in to Ms. Sundberg\u2019s possession, the whole audit file and all documents from production orders.\n[125] Mr. Jones testified that Audit had only reviewed Mr. McCartie\u2019s 2005 to 2007 years and that, after it was referred to Criminal Investigations, Criminal Investigations expanded their investigation audit to add 2008 and 2009.\n[126] Mr. Jones confirmed that Criminal Investigations had Mr. Brown\u2019s initial audit file of 2002-2003 and reviewed it. It is not entirely clear how, when or why it first came into Criminal Investigations\u2019 possession. He also confirmed that during the period Mr. Brown was in Criminal Investigations, being after he completed the initial audit of the McCarties and before he returned to Audit from Criminal Investigations and recommended the audits in question, Mr. Brown reported to Mr. Jones as his team leader as one of his Investigators.\n[127] Mr. Jones was present at the McCarties\u2019 home for the execution of the search warrant and throughout the search. He said that he does not recall if he was present for the search of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s desk.\n[128] With respect to the search and seizure at the McCarties\u2019 home, Mr. Jones testified that he and his whole Criminal Investigations\u2019 team of six or seven Investigators attended the execution of the search. They were supplemented by some Auditors and perhaps some Collections staff. Mr. Jones did not suggest that Ms. McCartie let the RCMP or the CRA into their home. He is clear that she opened the door and left the premises altogether, and only at that time did their search begin. He confirmed that he knew Ms. McCartie was not given the search warrant when she asked, or at all, but that a copy was left on the McCarties\u2019 dining room table at the end of the day.\n[129] This Court had the benefit of Mr. Jones\u2019 testimony on behalf of the Crown. Mr. Jones did not say he was at anytime unaware of the Criminal Code\u2019s requirement to provide a taxpayer a copy of the search warrant when asked. He did not say that his Criminal Investigations unit Investigators were not appropriately trained on executing search warrants, including that requirement. Mr. Jones did not defend or try to explain away what his two Investigators, Ms. Sundberg and Mr. Stenchman, did and didn\u2019t do when first executing the search warrant prior to the search of the home being conducted. He did not say his Investigators were following RCMP Constable Reynold\u2019s lead. Mr. Jones said that he was unaware of, and did not see or hear, what happened at the door even though he was at the property. I infer from this that, in fact, Mr. Jones and all of his Investigators present at the McCarties\u2019s home were aware of the requirements.\n[130] This testimony, that Judge Gouge did not have, leads me to conclude that the section 8 Charter breach of conducting the search without complying with the Criminal Code requirement that Ms. McCartie be given a copy of the search warrant when she asked for it was more severe and more deliberate, and on the opposite side of the centre line between good faith and bad faith, than Judge Gouge \u201caccepted\u201d in McCartie 2015-4.\n[131] Mr. Jones was clear in his testimony that none of the documents seized from the home assisted Ms. Sundberg with the assessments of tax as the only information used for the tax assessments came from the bank records received from the banks in compliance with the RFIs and production orders issued by CRA to the banks. Documents seized from the home were relied on to assess the penalties and to open the statute-barred years, along with the information from Ms. Sundberg\u2019s interviews with Dr. Loo and other third parties.\nVII. Law and analysis [132] This Court can, if appropriate, impose a section 24 Charter remedy in respect of the identified Charter breaches, including breaches under sections 8 and 11 regarding the BC criminal proceedings.\n[133] This is supported by the wording of section 24 itself. This is also supported by O\u2019Neill Motors Limited, 1998 CanLII 9070 (FCA), Donovan [2000] 4 FC 373, Warawa 2003 TCC 756 (affirmed 2005 FCA 34) and Canada v. Jurchison, 2001 FCA 126.\n[134] Cases such as Romanuk 2013 FCA 133, Piersanti 2014 FCA 243, Bauer 2018 FCA 62, Brooks 2019 TCC 47 (affirmed 2019 FCA 293) and SPE Valeur 2019 TCC 174, holding that a taxpayer cannot complain in the Tax Court of a section 8 or section 11 breach, are cases where no criminal proceeding had occurred in which the breach was raised and the breach determined to have occurred.\n[135] For example, in Warawa J.A. Sharlow was dealing with an appeal from J. Beaubier\u2019s decision in this Court that involved somewhat similar facts to this case. Mr. Warawa had been found in his related criminal proceeding to have had his Charter rights breached leading to the criminal trial not proceeding. Neither Justice Sharlow nor Justice Beaubier\u2019s reasons suggest a section 24 remedy could not be granted in this Court for the section 7 breach.\n[136] It is clear that this Court must reweigh the factors and the appropriate relief, if any, for Charter breaches under section 8 or 11 in a related criminal proceeding.\n[137] The parties do not disagree with this, although the respondent maintains that Mr. McCartie obtained a full remedy in the BC Court and no further remedy is warranted in this civil Tax Court proceeding. At times it did appear that the respondent did want to disagree in oral argument, but resiled when questioned.\n[138] Section 24 of the Charter requires that a Grant-type analysis be conducted. As described by Judge Gouge in McCartie 2015-4 above, a court must conduct a Grant analysis to determine what remedy, if any, is appropriate under section 24 of the Charter in respect of identified Charter breaches. This is required whether or not the breaches occurred in the proceeding considering the remedy. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Reilly 2021 SCC 38 has more recently described the Grant analysis considerations and weighing.\n[139] The parties do not disagree with how Judge Gouge approached and applied the Grant analysis in the BC Court proceedings. While the respondent Crown may not have agreed with the result of Judge Gouge\u2019s application, no appeal was taken.\n[140] The weighing of competing interests in a criminal proceeding for tax evasion may be different than in a civil tax proceeding involving the same circumstances, as regards the quantum of tax, the reopening of statute-barred years, and even the gross negligence penalties for tax offences under the ITA.\nVIII. The Grant Analysis and Conclusions [141] This is not a case in which the Grant analysis is easy or straightforward. Canadians rightly expect fellow taxpayers to pay their taxes and for there to be consequences for those who choose not to. Canadians also rightly expect law enforcement officers executing search warrants or collecting evidence to support an investigation of potential criminal wrongdoing, to be knowledgeable of, and to respect, at least the basic straightforward rules applicable when doing so.\n[142] I agree with Judge Gouge\u2019s considerations, his weighing of the competing considerations, and with the remedy he chose to impose in his court. The question that I must decide is what if any remedy should be imposed in this Tax Court proceeding.\n[143] In conducting the Grant analysis in this Court, I am mindful of the fact that the amounts in dispute in the Court are composed of three separate issues. These are the substantive issues to be ultimately decided in this proceeding:\n1) the amount of tax that should be paid and interest thereon;\n2)whether the statute-barred years are subject to being reopened after the normal reassessment period under the ITA, which requires the respondent show that a taxpayer has made a misrepresentation attributable to carelessness, neglect or wilful default, or has committed fraud; and\n3) the gross negligence penalties and whether the threshold for them applying has been met under the ITA, which requires the respondent show that the taxpayer has made a false statement in a return knowingly (including being wilfully blind) or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[144] With respect to the first issue, the quantum of the taxes owing, I think Canadians\u2019 expectations that their fellow Canadians pay their taxes owing as required by the ITA and HST legislation, weigh much more heavily in this Court and may be less easily displaced by other considerations in proceedings in this Court. I believe that is the case as I weigh the Grant factors in this tax appeal.\n[145] In the circumstances I conclude that the only evidence that the respondent should be precluded from relying on in this Court to establish the amount of tax (income tax, GST or HST) owing by Mr. McCartie is the evidence, if any, first collected from the search and seizure of the McCarties\u2019 home. This is not to suggest such is always or generally expected to be the case in respect of an unlawful search of a home as part of a parallel, related tax evasion proceeding. I find that the particular circumstances of the search of the McCarties\u2019 home in this case, combined with the existence of several other Charter breaches in this case, when weighed appropriately, lead to this being the appropriate section 24 remedy in Mr. McCartie\u2019s case. I also find it appropriate that the respondent\u2019s assumptions of fact when reassessing set out in its reply not have the benefit of being presumed to be correct and to subject the taxpayer to an initial burden to demolish them on a prima facie basis, to the extent that Hickman Motors principle remains.\n[146] A consideration of the Grant factors leads me to a similar conclusion with respect to the issue of the respondent\u2019s ability to maintain its assessments of otherwise statute-barred years, that it has reassessed after the normal assessment period had expired. The ITA allows such reassessments in circumstances where a taxpayer has made a misrepresentation in their tax return due to carelessness or neglect. The tax consequences of such an assessment being permitted to be made is that the taxpayer is assessed for the taxes, and interest thereon, on the amount that they should have reported correctly in their return. Those are the amounts Canadians are expected to pay, and that Canadians expect their fellow Canadians to pay. This weighing of the Grant factors again leads me to the conclusion that only the evidence first collected by the respondent from the search of the McCarties\u2019 home should be excluded in this Tax Court proceeding given the particular circumstances of the search of the McCarties\u2019 home and the existence of the other Charter breaches. The respondent has the burden of proof with respect to reassessing statute-barred years under the ITA or any comparable GST or HST requirement.\n[147] Given the state of the evidence on the voir dire, and in particular the absence of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s testimony, I am not deciding the issue at this time of what evidence, if any, was first obtained during the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. This issue can be dealt with if a dispute arises as this tax appeal moves forward.\n[148] Although the audit of Mr. McCartie\u2019s 2008 and 2009 years was initiated by Criminal Investigations, I do not think that, on the facts in question in this case and weighing the Grant considerations, it would be an appropriate remedy to allow Mr. McCartie\u2019s appeal of those two years.\n[149] Miss Sundberg, her Team Leader Mr. Jones, and all of their colleagues who prepared for and attended the search of the McCarties\u2019 home, failed to properly execute the search. The same is true of Corporal Reynolds and perhaps his RCMP colleague in attendance. While I defer to Judge Gouge who heard testimony from Ms. Sundberg and Corporal Reynolds as regards these two not intentionally failing to comply with the requirements to properly execute a search warrant, or threatening to break down a door instead of providing a copy of the search warrant when asked as required, I have great difficulty believing the entire Criminal Investigation\u2019s unit in Vancouver, including its Team Leader Mr. Jones, could have been unaware of such a requirement and prepared the Criminal Investigation\u2019s unit accordingly for this attendance and for execution of search warrants generally. While I did not hear from Ms. Sundberg or Sergent Corporal Reynolds, I did hear from Mr. Jones.\n[150] Penalties under the ITA and GST\/HST legislation are penalties, intended to punish Canadians for their choice to not comply with the statutory requirements of our tax legislation intentionally or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence. They clearly do not engage sections 8 and 11 of the Charter, and therefore civil penalty proceedings under our tax legislation can not, on their own, result in breaches of those two Charter sections, resulting in a remedy therefor under section 24. However, this is not such a case. In Mr. McCartie\u2019s case the BC Court has properly found these two sections of the Charter were breached. Judge Gouge imposed a section 24 remedy in the BC Court proceeding. The question in this Court is whether any further section 24 remedies are appropriate in this Court for all of the Charter breaches against Mr. McCartie found by the BC Court to have occurred \u2014 including sections 8 and 11. That requires a separate weighing of the Grant factors by this Court in respect of the civil penalties than in respect of the quantum of tax and reassessing after normal reassessment period.\n[151] While I agree with Judge Gouge\u2019s Grant analysis, he found that Ms. Sundberg and the RCMP actions were unintentional and bona fides. I accept that. However, I believe that Canadian taxpayers might strongly doubt that as they reasonably expect CRA\u2019s law enforcement officers and RCMP officers executing search warrants, especially on an individual\u2019s home, to be familiar with the basic aspects of execution and to be properly trained in such matters. I base this on decades of experience in dealing with Canadian taxpayers of all sorts from across this country\u2014French, English and those Canadians who need the use of translators in other languages, from those Canadians who only access social benefits from CRA, employees who receive paycheques, small and medium businesses and their owners, through to Canada\u2019s major financial institutions, big pharma and Canadians who own them and who are prosperous. I would expect the majority of Canadian taxpayers, if asked, would make it very clear that they would have trouble accepting that CRA Criminal Investigators executing search warrants were unaware of taxpayers\u2019 rights to a copy of the search warrant as required by the Criminal Code provision authorizing search warrants. It would bring the Canadian judicial system including this Court, and including CRA\u2019s administration and enforcement of the ITA, into disrepute to think that, even if not done in bad faith, CRA\u2019s officials and RCMP enforcing search warrants are not appropriately trained on such a basic and necessary right of all Canadians to fundamentally coexist and together fund the operation of this country and distribute its social programs and its fiscal and economic programs.\n[152] All Canadians challenging a CRA decision must engage with CRA. An objection to CRA is required before taxpayers can appeal to this Court. Many Canadians do go on to initiate proceedings in this Court. The Tax Court deals with alleged detaxers\u2019 tax and penalty obligations very often, relatively consistently and effectively, and in published decisions. The Federal Court of Appeal does so as well. Canadians know this. Similarly, CRA appears readily able to identify and pursue alleged detaxers in accordance with the ITA and the Criminal Code without breaching taxpayers\u2019 Charter rights. I do not believe this will be eroded in any material way if this Court finds that Mr. McCartie is entitled to a remedy in this Court as a result of the breaches of his and his family\u2019s Charter rights by CRA and the RCMP assisting it.\n[153] On the other hand, it is not often that a taxpayer brings to the attention of this Court, and has very convincing evidence to show, that CRA investigators blatantly breached their Charter rights on multiple occasions in this pursuit, even when searching their homes with the RCMP at CRA\u2019s side, and despite a clear and straightforward provision of the Criminal Code\u2019s warrant provisions. In such circumstances, confronted with this, I believe it is necessary that I recognize the importance that this Court clearly impose consequences in the form of section 24 remedies to avoid Canadians losing faith in their Canadian justice system\u2019s commitment and obligation to ensure that our shared tax burden is both lawfully shared by taxpayers, and lawfully administered and collected by our revenue authorities in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation and all other applicable law. This can be expected to help keep cases such as this rare and exceptional.\n[154] Transfers of CRA staff between Audit and Investigations are understandable. However, Canadians might expect there to be an ethical wall to prevent Investigators being involved in investigations into taxpayers they had previously been involved with in Audit or any other department, and certainly to prevent Auditors who had been in Investigations from initiating an audit or taking audit measures in respect of taxpayers they had previously investigated or had previously audited before being in Investigations. This case demonstrates how this can erode the Canadian public\u2019s confidence in CRA and law enforcement, and the public\u2019s credibility of the testimony in our courts of law enforcement officers. This would be particularly problematic in our taxation system which is built and dependent upon a self-assessment regime.\n[155] I find that the appropriate section 24 remedy in this Court with respect to income tax, GST and HST penalties is that the respondent not be allowed to rely on any evidence collected from the second audit or collected from the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. These are the same such remedies as Judge Gouge determined to be appropriate with respect to the penal proceedings.\n[156] I am satisfied that these remedies under section 24 of the Charter constitute the satisfactory and appropriate remedies in respect of the events complained of that were related to, and gave rise to, the Charter breaches, without the need to consider the Canadian Bill of Rights due process right to the enjoyment of property and its right to the principles of fundamental justice, or to the principles of procedural fairness in Canadian courts.\n[157] The Appellant is entitled to costs on this hearing.\n[158] The parties shall have 30 days from the date hereof to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the parties shall have a further 30 days to file written submissions on costs. Each party will have a further 15 days thereafter to file any responding submissions. Any such submissions shall not exceed 15 pages in length initially, and 10 pages for responding submissions. If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received from the appellant, costs shall be awarded in the amount set out in the Tariff to the Rules of the Tax Court of Canada (General Procedure).\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of February 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 16\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2016-2716(IT)G , 2016-2717(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCOLIN MCCARTIE AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nVancouver, British Columbia\nDATE OF HEARING:\nSeptember 20 to 23, 2021 and October 13 to 15, 2021\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Patrick Boyle\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 6, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nEric Brown\nJamie Hansen\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\nAPPENDIX A - McCartie 2015-1\nBACKGROUND\n[1] This prosecution has a long and complex procedural history. For detailed summary, the reader may refer to a decision which I rendered on May 29, 2014: R vs McCartie 2014 BCPC 128; [2014] BCJ #1227. In brief:\na. Mr. & Ms. McCartie are charged with tax evasion.\nb. Some of the evidence which the Crown proposes to tender against them was obtained by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) from Mr.& Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers under the Income Tax Act. Crown counsel inform me that that evidence is crucial to the Crown\u2019s case.\nc. Relying on R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757, Mr. and Ms. McCartie seek to exclude that evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained from them by compelled disclosure under CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers at a time when the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s enquiries was to obtain evidence for use in a criminal prosecution. In order to rule on that issue, it would be necessary for me to determine the date upon which the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s enquiries changed from a civil audit to a criminal investigation (\u201cthe Key Date\u201d).\nd. The first CRA audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie was conducted by Mr. Brown, in 2004 \u2013 2005. After he issued his audit report, Ms. Karen Etches of CRA\u2019s Investigations Department asked to meet with Mr. Brown to discuss the audit. The sole function of the Investigations Department is to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Brown met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, another member of the Investigations Department. No decision to prosecute was taken at that time. However, Mr. Brown recommended a second audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Ms. Annette Coles was assigned to conduct that audit. In the course of that duty, Ms. Coles exercised CRA\u2019s statutory power to compel Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers to disclose the documents in question.\ne. Ms. Coles\u2019 practice was to make detailed notes of her meetings with other CRA staff. She believes that she followed that practice in this case. It is reasonable to think that her notes might shed light on the intentions and purposes of other CRA staff with whom she met during the course of her audit, and so might assist in determining the Key Date. However, her notes have been lost.\nf. Mr. Gibson, who was Crown counsel at an early stage of this prosecution, informed Mr. & Ms. McCartie by letter that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes appear to have been lost as a result of a computer malfunction, and that no further information on that subject is available.\ng. Mr. & Ms. McCartie submit that the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes impairs their ability to establish the Key Date (the onus of proof of which lies upon them)[13], and so impairs their ability to make full answer and defence. They seek a judicial stay of proceedings, relying on Regina vs La 1997 CanLII 309 (SCC), [1997] 2 SCR 680. In considering that issue, I must decide whether it should be inferred that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes were lost as a result of \u201c\u2026 an unacceptable degree of negligent conduct \u2026.\u201d on the part of CRA: R vs La @ paragraph 22. The very brief statement in Mr. Gibson\u2019s letter is insufficient to allow me to decide that question.\nh. Mr. Preshaw, who succeeded Mr. Gibson as Crown counsel, undertook to call any Crown witnesses whom the court considers to be necessary on this issue. I am obliged to decide whether the Crown must call Mr. Gibson to identify his sources of information and to elaborate upon the statement in his letter.\nAPPENDIX B - McCartie 2015-2\nTHE ISSUE\n[1] Mr. & Ms. McCartie are charged with tax evasion. On this application, they seek a judicial stay of the prosecution, on the ground that, in the circumstances prevailing, it is not possible to provide them with a fair trial, to which they are entitled by section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms.\n[2] The following are the pertinent circumstances:\na. The Crown\u2019s case depends upon certain documents procured by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) from Mr. & Ms. McCartie and their bankers by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers.\nb. Mr. & Ms. McCartie assert that, at the time that the statutory audit powers were exercised, CRA\u2019s primary objective was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. If that assertion is proven, the documents in question ought to be excluded from evidence: R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757.\nc. Mr. & Ms. McCartie carry the onus of proving the motives and intentions of certain members of CRA\u2019s staff.[14] They can discharge that onus only by successful cross-examinations of those individuals.\nc. Ms. Coles, the CRA auditor who exercised CRA\u2019s statutory powers to procure the documents, made notes of her meetings with other CRA staff and with Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Those notes might shed light on the motives and intentions of other CRA staff at relevant times. The notes have been lost.\nd. Other CRA staff did not make notes of certain key meetings. If they had, the notes might shed light on the motives and intentions of those who attended the meetings.\n[3] The questions are whether the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes and the omission by other CRA staff to make notes materially affect the fairness of the trial and, if so, what remedy ought to be granted.\nTHE EVIDENCE THUS FAR\n[4] Two separate CRA departments were involved in the matter: (i) the Audit Department, which conducts audits to determine the civil liability of taxpayers; and (ii) the Investigations Department, which conducts criminal investigations of tax evasion and directs prosecutions for such offences. The Investigations Department was formerly known as the Enforcement Department.\n[5] In July, 2004, Mr. Jason Brown was working as an auditor in the Audit Department. He was assigned to audit the tax returns of Mr. & Ms. McCartie for the years 2002 and 2003. He disallowed certain business expenses which they had deducted from gross income and issued a notice of re-assessment. He also imposed penalties under section 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, which provides:\n\u2026\nWhen Mr. Brown imposed the penalty, he prepared a penalty report for inclusion in the Audit Department file.\n[6] In his oral evidence, Mr. Brown denied that he suspected Mr. or Ms. McCartie of fraud or tax evasion. However, three passages in his penalty report cast some doubt on his evidence.\na. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nThe taxpayers\u2019 records were inadequate for income tax purposes. Furthermore, some of the expense receipts were not even incurred by the taxpayer.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr. Brown characterized that statement as an assumption, rather than an assertion. The document does not support that characterization.\n(Emphasis added)\nb. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlong with the egregious amounts of personal expenses being deducted, there were many other problems with the records. Some of the cash expenses were already recorded.\nIn answer to Mr. McCartie\u2019s question during cross-examination, Mr. Brown confirmed that this passage was intended to convey Mr. Brown\u2019s suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie had double-reported, or claimed twice, certain expenses.\nc. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlso, the taxpayer deducted two receipts from the same restaurant bill.\n[7] Mr. Brown completed his audit in March 2005. About two months later, he was approached by Ms. Etches, who was then the Assistant Director of the Investigations Department. Ms. Etches asked Mr. Brown to meet with her to discuss Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s file. Mr. Brown believes that it is the practice of the Investigations Department to review all penalty reports, and that it was his penalty report which brought Mr. & Ms. McCartie to Ms. Etches\u2019 attention. Mr. Brown met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, another staff member in the Investigations Department. In his oral evidence, Mr. Brown described the meeting in the following terms:\n\u2026 [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] were asking me questions about possibly conducting an investigation and I told them that this is mostly just personal expenses and unsupported expenses, and I don\u2019t think that this would warrant a -- a full-on investigation. I just felt that it was just a -- that [Mr. & Ms. McCartie] were just negligent.\n* * *\nAnd then [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] said okay, and I guess they decided not to go forth with it.\n* * *\n\u2026 [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] said right there in the -- in the interview, they said \u201cOkay, well, we really thought it was just a bigger issue than it really is\u201d.\n[8] No documentary record of the meeting has been disclosed, and it may be that none ever existed.\n[9] Mr. Brown was transferred to the Enforcement Department for the period from February to September, 2007. He returned to work in the Audit Department in September or October, 2007.\n[10] In November, 2007, Mr. Brown completed and submitted a document, on CRA Form T-133, entitled \u201cTax Lead or Project Information\u201d, the purpose of which was to recommend a further audit of Ms. & Mr. McCartie, in relation to their tax returns for the years 2005 - 2006. In that document, Mr. Brown said:\nGeodiscovery Interactive Inc is owned by Annie McCartie although day-to-day operations are performed by Annie\u2019s spouse, Colin.\nAnnie and Colin reported a total income of $28,035 from April 2005 to December 31, 2006. However, according to income and expense statements provided to trustee, they have personal expenditures of between $4000 and $5000 per month, or between $84,000 and $105,000 from April, 2005 to December 31, 2006.\nThe only known source of revenue is Annie\u2019s company, Geodiscovery Interactive Inc in 2006. Geodiscovery reported $145,000 in subcontracts on gross sales of $165,000, and no T4A\u2019s issued. Was this $145,000 paid to Colin? Between Colin and Annie, they only reported gross income of $1635 in 2006.\nColin and Annie were previously audited and reassessed for a large amount of expenses that were deducted. In 2004, Colin declared bankruptcy and was absolved of his tax debt.\nIn June, 2007 (outside audit period) the McCarties sold their house for $365,000 and purchased a new house for $540,000. Where\u2019s all this money coming from?\nPossible net worth.\n[11] As a result of that document, Mr. Ian Chabot, an auditor in the Audit Department, was assigned to conduct an audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s tax returns for the years 2005 \u2013 2007. Mr. Chabot fell ill before making any significant progress in the audit, and Ms. Annette Coles was assigned to replace him.\n[12] Ms. Coles, accompanied by another CRA auditor, Mr. Lecznar, met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie in November, 2008. As a result of information provided by Mr. & Ms. McCartie at that meeting, Ms. Coles exercised CRA\u2019s statutory powers to require Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers to produce to her copies of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bank records. The bankers provided her with the copies demanded, as they were obliged to do. Mr. Gibson, who was Crown counsel at the inception of this prosecution, informed me that those documents are essential to the Crown\u2019s case. Statutory demands were issued to the banks in December, 2008 and the documents were provided to CRA in January \u2013 February, 2009.\n[13] Ms. Coles was re-assigned in or about March, 2009, and was replaced as the auditor of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns by Mr. McLachlan. Mr. McLachlan reviewed the bank documents, and formed the conclusion that they would support a prosecution for tax evasion. He made that recommendation, which was accepted. On the basis of that recommendation, the Investigations Department launched a criminal investigation, obtained a search warrant and seized Mr. McLachlan\u2019s file (which contained the bank records). This prosecution ensued.\n[1] In McCartie v. HMQ, 2018 TCC 185, Justice Bocock decided at the first phase of a Rule 58 motion that these issues were best left to the trial judge.\n[2] It would have been preferable had the parties communicated their agreement to the Court in advance so that the measures in place regarding Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evasion and non\u2011appearance for that morning could have been stepped down.\n[3] Judge Gouge had read the tax lead documents and would have been fully aware of their date and contexts, and perhaps their identity. Informer privilege precluded the McCarties having this information.\n[4] The possibility of amicus curiae was also considered, but was found to be precluded by valid precedent.\n[5] Note Mr. Brown omits that those reassessments had been largely vacated on objection to CRA Appeals.\n[6] This is separate and distinct from Mr. Brown's T-133 Tax Lead.\n[7] The term voir dire hearing is used by me to identify the BC Court\u2019s voir dires and related procedural applications, separate from the trial days upon which some of the evidence is drawn by Judge Gouge.\n[8] Note Ms. Sundberg knew that crossing the threshold would constitute executing the warrant.\n[9] It is important to note that Judge Gouge appears to be misremembering or somewhat inexact in his paragraph 5 regarding his earlier decision in McCartie 2015-2. This is perhaps understandable given the complex, lengthy and circuitous nature of the proceedings. It is clear that, prior to addressing the Trial Fairness aspects in McCartie 2015 -2, Judge Gouge concludes (paragraphs 12, 47-48) that \"there has been a breach of Mr. and Ms. McCartie's right under section 7 of the Charter\" by virtue of the Coles Notes having been \"lost deliberately or by unacceptable negligence\" on the part of CRA. Section 7 is the right to fundamental justice. This finding of a Charter breach was a precursor to his Trial Fairness and Remedy analyses. Judge Gouge also refers to and considers the Coles Notes and any other lost notes in his paragraphs 63, 65 and 66 under his Remedy section that results in the exclusion from evidence of the documents procured by CRA in the 2005\u20112007 second audit.\n[10] There appears to be no reported decision. I was not told by either party if Judge Gouge gave reasons, much less what his reasons were. Judge Gouge's wording describes it here as resulting from the Crown's concession, and not just from Judge Gouge's order excluding from evidence the documents procured by CRA in the second audit. It can be noted that Judge Gouge and the Crown had information not disclosed to the McCarties or to me from their in camera hearing regarding the Key Date.\n[11] See paragraphs 47-48\n[12] Referral to Criminal Investigations-Tab 16 Appellant's Book of Documents\n[13] Note that elsewhere, and in later decisions, Judge Gouge is clear he has not decided the issue of who bears the onus regarding when CRA's predominant purpose changed from a civil audit to a criminal investigation. See especially McCartie 2013-1, 2013-2.\n[14] see footnote 13, (immediately preceding footnote) Supra\n",

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 17\nDate: 20240207\nDocket: 2022-2644(GST)I\nBETWEEN:\nKEYVAN AHMADI,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Keyvan Ahmadi, appeals the denial by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) of his application for a GST\/HST New Housing Rebate under the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cETA\u201d) with respect to a property he purchased in Toronto in 2010 (the \u201cRebate Property\u201d).\n[2] Parliament has imposed several conditions for that rebate, one of which is in paragraph 254(2)(b) of the ETA (emphasis added):\n254(2) Where\n\u2026\n(b) at the time the particular individual becomes liable or assumes liability under an agreement of purchase and sale of the complex or unit entered into between the builder and the particular individual, the particular individual is acquiring the complex or unit for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual, \u2026\n[3] In the Reply, the Crown pleaded that the Minister made the following assumptions of fact in denying the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate to the Appellant (emphasis added):\n(a) the Appellant signed an agreement of purchase and sale with a builder on December 1, 2010, with respect to the Rebate Property;\n(b) the purchase price of the Rebate Property was $415,046.10, exclusive of GST\/HST;\n(c) the Appellant took possession of the Rebate Property on September 19, 2014;\n(d) the Rebate Property was listed for sale and sold to a third party in December of 2014 for a purchase price of $448,000;\n(e) at the time the Rebate Property was purchased, the Appellant did not intend that either he or a qualified relation of the Appellant would occupy the Rebate Property as a primary place of residence;\n(f) the Appellant reported no employment income for the years between when the Rebate Property was purchased in 2010 to when the appellant moved into the Rebate Property in 2014; and\n(g) in December of 2014, the Appellant moved from the Rebate Property to his parents\u2019 house located at 539 Elgin Mills Road West, Richmond Hill ON, L4C 4M3.\n[4] The Crown was the only party to produce any documents at the hearing. The Crown\u2019s documents included:\nExhibit R-1: Mortgage agreement dated October 28, 2014 signed by the Appellant for a loan of $354,240 payable monthly at a 4.25% fixed interest rate for a year ($1,734.95\/month).\nExhibit R-2: Statement of adjustments dated September 19, 2014 indicating a purchase price of $442,800 and that the purchasers were Keyvan Ahmadi and Peyman Ahmadi.\nExhibit R-3: Income tax return information for the 2010 taxation year indicating the Appellant\u2019s total reported income of $14,426.\nExhibit R-4: Income tax return information for the 2014 taxation year indicating the Appellant\u2019s total income of $3,968.\n[5] This appeal turns on whether the Appellant adduced sufficient evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he intended to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence when he entered into the agreement of purchase and sale in 2010. Notwithstanding his oral assertion that intended to do so, I conclude that the Appellant\u2019s evidence falls short of the mark for the following reasons:\nThe Appellant would not have been able to afford the annual mortgage payment of $20,820 on a reported income of less than $15,000 in 2010;\nIn response to that concern, the Appellant explained that his actual 2010 income exceeded the amount of income reported for that year as he did not disclose his cash income on that return. The Court was not reassured by this explanation. On the contrary, it only diminished the Appellant\u2019s credibility;\nThe Appellant\u2019s testimony that his parents helped him purchase the Rebate Property was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal in which he alleged that his partner at the time helped him purchase the Rebate Property;\nThe Appellant\u2019s testimony that his parents no longer helped him with the ongoing expenses of the Rebate Property after they separated was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal in which he alleged that his partner no longer helped him with the ongoing expenses of the Rebate Property after they broke up;\nAlthough the mortgage document does not bear his brother\u2019s signature, the Appellant maintained that his brother co-signed the mortgage;\nThe Appellant became evasive when asked to identify his own signature on the mortgage document admitting only that it might have been a \u201cpartial signature\u201d; and\nThe Appellant could not recall when he moved into the Rebate Property \u2212 not even which season it was at the time.\n[6] In summary, the Appellant\u2019s evidence about his intention to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence lacked credibility and was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal. In such circumstances, it is significant that the Appellant\u2019s evidence was unsupported by documentary evidence or evidence from a third party. The Appellant has simply failed to prove sufficient facts to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he intended to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence when he entered into the agreement of purchase and sale. His appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 18\nDate: 20240214\nDocket: 2016-2036(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nEDWARD DEMCHYNSKI,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\n[1] Using the net worth method, the Minister assessed the Appellant for failing to report substantial income on his income tax returns for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years. He was also assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).\n[2] The Appellant; his spouse, Shannon Demchynski; and the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) auditor, Joanne Douglas, who conducted the audit of the Appellant, testified during the hearing.\n[3] I found Ms. Douglas to be a credible witness. I did not find either the Appellant or Mrs. Demchynski to be a credible witness.\n[4] Mrs. Demchynski briefly testified with respect to her family\u2019s lifestyle. As I will discuss, this testimony was shown on cross-examination to be misleading.\n[5] I found the Appellant not to be forthcoming with respect to his contracting business and his family\u2019s lifestyle. He was very evasive during cross-examination with respect to these two topics.\n[6] Under cross-examination, he either could not recall damaging testimony that he provided under oath during his examination for discovery or directly contradicted such damaging testimony.\n[7] In many instances, the objective evidence before me contradicted the Appellant\u2019s testimony. This included his testimony with respect to his hours worked for his employer, his primary source of income, the nature of his contracting business and his family\u2019s lifestyle. He was not a credible witness.\nThe Appellant\u2019s sources of income\n[8] The Appellant testified that he worked full time for the town of The Pas at a hockey rink cleaning the ice surface. In the summertime, he cut grass for the town. He testified that he carried on a \u201cside\u201d endeavour or business of performing carpentry work and \u201chome repairs and stuff for people.\u201d He noted that he carried on the business on his days off from his job with the town and on weekends when he could.\n[9] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony on his sources of income. In my view, it was an attempt to downplay his principal source of income, namely, the carrying on of a business as a contractor. His testimony that he carried on a part\u2011time business of performing carpentry work and home repairs was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court. His testimony on this point seriously damaged his credibility.\n[10] In an attempt to support the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he worked full time for the town of The Pas, the Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the Appellant the following leading questions with respect to a pay stub of the Appellant that the Appellant filed as Exhibit A-72:\nQ Okay. I want you to go to Volume 7, Tab 72, please.\nA Okay.\nQ So I \u2013 I\u2019m just going to talk you through it. I think we can all read this. Is \u2013 this is a pay stub?\nA Yes, it is.\nQ And this \u2013 and it says \u2013 it\u2019s dated, basically, end of December 23, and it\u2019s got year to date. So is it fair to say this would be the \u2013 the last pay stub for the \u2013 for the year for 2011?\nA Yes, it would be.\nQ Okay. And are the \u2013 do these numbers look accurate?\nA I would say so.\nQ So \u2013 and just on the bottom, sir, it says 2,155.27. So for the Town of The Pas \u2013 by the way, does this pay stub reflect what you just told the Court? This is Zamboni and cutting grass, et cetera?\nA Yes, it would be.\nQ Okay. And at the bottom, it says two-thousand-one-five-five-point-two-seven. Did you work almost 2200 hours for the Town of The Pas that year?\nA Yes, I would have. I worked full-time.\n[11] The issue with counsel\u2019s questions and the Appellant\u2019s answers is that the 2,155.27 referred to by counsel does not represent the hours that the Appellant worked in 2011 but rather represents his gross pay of $2,155.27 for the two-week pay period ending on December 23, 2011.\n[12] An estimate of the hours that he worked can be determined from the pay stub. The first line of numbers under the title \u201cEarnings\u201d shows year-to-date regular employment income of $31,598.19 at a rate of $21.51 per hour. The Appellant testified that the town paid him roughly the same hourly rate throughout the year. This means that he worked 1,469 regular hours during the 2011 year.\n[13] His total compensation from the town of The Pas was lower in 2009 and 2010.\n[14] This evidences that his job for the town of The Pas was more of a part-time or seasonal job. Since he worked at a hockey rink, I assume that the Appellant\u2019s job with the town of The Pas was a seasonal job that he worked mainly during the hockey season.\n[15] The Appellant provided limited evidence with respect to his contracting business. Exhibit A-57 contains invoices that the Appellant issued in respect of his contracting business. The invoices are identified as quotations; however, the Appellant testified that these were actually the invoices that he issued to customers.\n[16] The Appellant provided all of these invoices, except for an invoice for $45,000 issued in August 2010,[1] to Ms. Douglas during the audit.\n[17] Exhibits A-14, A-17 and A-22 summarize the invoices provided to Ms. Douglas. The invoices, plus the invoice at Exhibit R-61, evidence that the Appellant had gross income (including any GST that he charged) from his contracting business of at least $250,559 in 2009, $451,356 in 2010 and $209,692 in 2011. However, the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued in respect of the Appellant\u2019s contracting business.\n[18] It can be seen from the summaries and the actual invoices that each of the invoices has a quotation\/invoice number. These numbers evidence that the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued by the Appellant. For example, for the 2009 taxation year, the Court was only provided with 8 of the 34 invoices issued with quotation\/invoice numbers between 108151 and 108185.[2] The summary at Exhibit A-17 evidences that the Court was only provided with 4 of the 12 invoices issued in the 2010 taxation year with quotation\/invoice numbers between 108186 and 108198. The summary at Exhibit A-22 evidences that the Court was provided with 12 invoices in respect of the 2011 taxation year. Exhibit A-22 shows that the Appellant used two sets of invoices in 2011. One set consisted of invoices that were numbered between 186159 and 186191. The second set consisted of invoices that were numbered between 254108 and 254128. Clearly, the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued in 2011.\n[19] This factual finding is supported by Ms. Douglas\u2019s analysis of amounts deposited into the Appellant\u2019s bank accounts. For each of the years at issue, Ms. Douglas reviewed the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and credit card statements to determine the amount of deposits that the Appellant made into each of these accounts. She then deducted what she could identify as \u201cnon-business income deposits\u201d such as interest, bank charges, child tax benefits, transfers between accounts, the Appellant\u2019s income from employment, Mrs. Demchynski\u2019s income from employment, income tax refunds, and merchandise returns. The result was assumed to be deposits from business receipts.[3]\n[20] Using this method, Ms. Douglas estimated that the Appellant received gross business income (including any GST that he charged) of $352,590 in 2009, $614,050.99 in 2010 and $327,325.07 in 2011. Over the three years, this equals $1,293,966.06 of gross business income. The $1,293,966.06 exceeds the $911,607 of gross business income shown on the invoices provided by the Appellant by $382,359.06. This constitutes additional evidence that the Appellant did not provide the Court with copies of all of the invoices that he issued to customers during the relevant years.\n[21] The Appellant testified that his clients included insurance companies and individual homeowners. His work for one insurance company included building a home that had been damaged by a fire.\n[22] The Appellant testified that he only charged GST on the invoices issued to the insurance companies. He did not charge GST on the invoices issued to the individual homeowners. The insurance companies informed him that his invoices had to include GST.\n[23] The Appellant did not remit any of the GST that he collected from the insurance companies. At some point, he pleaded guilty to a criminal offence for failing to remit GST.\n[24] The Appellant testified that he had a quote book that contained the quotes (invoices) for each job and the receipts for expenses incurred to complete the job. He did not provide the quote books to the CRA or file them as evidence with the Court. The Appellant testified that he \u201cthrew\u201d the quote books out before the CRA began to audit the relevant years. The audit began on January 2, 2013, only 8 months after he filed his tax return for the 2011 taxation year. Under subsection 230(4), the Appellant was required to keep for six years all records and books of account for each of his taxation years, together with every account and voucher necessary to verify the information contained in his records and books. The Appellant did not comply with this provision.\n[25] The evidence before me leads to a factual finding that that Appellant carried on a substantial contracting business during each of the relevant taxation years. Further, the dates on the invoices provided to the Court indicate that the business was carried on throughout each year.\n[26] On the basis of the evidence before the Court, I have concluded that the Appellant carried on a full-time business of acting as a contractor and was employed on a part-time\/seasonal basis to clean the ice at the hockey rink and mow lawns.\n[27] The Appellant had two other sources of income. One was rental income in 2010 and 2011 from two rental properties that he constructed in 2009 and 2010. I will discuss each of these properties when discussing the net worth calculation.\n[28] The other source of income was from the sale of land in 2010. In 2003, the Appellant purchased 39 acres of land for $50,000. He subsequently subdivided the land into a number of lots. The Appellant built a family home on one of the lots, gifted some of the lots to family members and sold the remaining lots to third parties.\n[29] In 2005, he sold four of the lots to third parties for consideration of $74,000. He sold one lot in 2007 for consideration of $22,000 and one lot in 2008 for consideration of $10,000. In 2010, he sold two lots for consideration of $48,000.\nIncome reported on Appellant\u2019s income tax returns\n[30] In his tax return for 2009, the Appellant reported employment income of $28,217.75, gross business income of $45,180 and a loss from this business of $651.[4]\n[31] In his tax return for 2010, the Appellant reported employment income of $31,813.76, net rental income of $13,810, gross business income of $45,814 and a loss from this business of $1,291.58.[5]\n[32] In his tax return for 2011, the Appellant reported employment income of $49,593.14, net rental income of $10,312.21, gross business income of $54,255.80 and a loss from this business of $12,324.19.[6]\nCRA\u2019s determination of the Appellant\u2019s income\n[33] As I noted in Berezuik v. The Queen, 2010 TCC 296, at paragraph 16:\n\u2026 The net worth analysis is a method of last resort. The method should only be used where, due to a lack of reliable records, approaches that are more conventional cannot be used. However, as this Court has noted on numerous occasions, it is open to the Minister under subsection 152(7) to use the net worth method whenever he considers it appropriate. It is not the role of this Court to question the use of the net worth method by the Minister to assess the Appellants; rather I must, based upon the evidence before me, determine the correctness of the assessments at issue.\n[34] Ms. Douglas noted that the audit of the Appellant occurred because of a lead obtained from a CRA collector who was doing field work in the town of The Pas. The collector obtained information that the Appellant was working for cash and not reporting income from his contracting business, the sale of lots or the rental properties.\n[35] Ms. Douglas explained why she used the net worth method to determine the Appellant\u2019s income.\n[36] After her initial meetings with the Appellant and his spouse, she determined that the Appellant had no books and records for his contracting business. There was no ledger to show revenue accounts or expenses. She had no records to verify.\n[37] The only information that the Appellant provided to Ms. Douglas was a grocery bag full of receipts for 2011. He provided no receipts for 2009 or 2010.\n[38] Ms. Douglas, after being informed by the Appellant that his gross income was around $54,000, quickly reviewed the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and noticed that bank deposits far exceeded the $54,000. As discussed previously, deposits were well in excess of $1 million over the three-year period.\n[39] This is a classic situation where the CRA, on account of the lack of books and records and the unexplained deposits that appeared on the taxpayer\u2019s bank statements, was forced to use the net worth method to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income. This was the only method available to Ms. Douglas to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income.\n[40] Ms. Douglas performed a fairly standard net worth calculation for the Appellant. The components of the calculation are as follows:\n-First, she determined the Appellant\u2019s total assets as at December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Ms. Douglas divided the assets into two groups: business assets and personal assets.\n-She then determined the Appellant\u2019s total liabilities at the end of each of the years. The liabilities were divided into business liabilities and personal liabilities.\n-The increase or decrease in the Appellant\u2019s net worth was then calculated.\n-Ms. Douglas then made a number of positive adjustments to the calculated increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth for each year. The most significant positive adjustment was the addition of substantial personal expenditures.\n-Next, Ms. Douglas made negative adjustments to the calculated amount in respect of income tax refunds and child tax benefits.\n-Ms. Douglas then compared the number arrived at after making the adjustments to the income reported by the Appellant and his spouse on their income tax returns. The difference was treated as unreported business income.\n-Ms. Douglas\u2019s final step was to reduce the calculated unreported business income to take into account the fact that the two rental properties shown on the assets schedule for the Appellant had been double counted. I will discuss this double counting shortly.\n[41] After removing the double counting of the rental properties, Ms. Douglas concluded, on the basis of the net worth analysis, that the Appellant had understated his business income in each of the relevant taxation years as follows:\n- 2009 taxation year \u2013 $311,509\n- 2010 taxation year \u2013 $440,216\n- 2011 taxation year \u2013 $142,184\n[42] The Respondent notes in his Reply that on account of a processing error, the Appellant was only assessed to increase his business income by $306,916, $434,212 and $134,984.\n[43] Since the Respondent used the net worth method to calculate the unreported business income of the Appellant, he assumed that the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth each year and the amount that the Appellant spent on personal expenditures were funded by income that the Appellant had earned in each of the years.\n[44] The Respondent made a concession at the commencement of the hearing with respect to the amount of personal expenditures incurred by the Appellant in each of the relevant years. The Respondent conceded that the amount of personal expenditures should be reduced by $7,007.46 in 2009, $23,101.65 in 2010 and $16,503.74 in 2011. The Respondent concluded that such expenditures were business expenses of the Appellant. As a result, my judgment will reduce the Appellant\u2019s unreported business income by the amounts conceded by the Respondent.\n[45] Ms. Douglas provided detailed evidence regarding the calculations that she performed with respect to the net worth calculation. After taking into account all of the adjustments that she made, I am satisfied that her calculations contain no material errors.\n[46] Schedule I of the net worth calculation shows the Appellant\u2019s assets increasing from $428,592 at December 31, 2008 to $718,410 at December 31, 2009\u2013an increase of $289,818. However, Ms. Douglas subsequently reduced this amount by $145,000 to take into account her double counting of the asset shown on Schedule I as \u201cApartment Block \u2013 3 plex at 213 Crossley\u201d (the \u201cThree-plex\u201d). The double counting occurred when the Three-plex was included twice in Schedule I: once as \u201cUCC per Schedule 1a \u2013 CCA\u201d and a second time as \u201cApartment Block \u2013 3 plex 213 Crossley\u201d.\n[47] The Appellant testified that the Three-plex was a three-plex rental unit that he had built in 2009. The $145,000 reduction for the double counting is shown on Schedule V under the heading \u201cDeduct: Known audit adjustments, Other \u2013 Apartment blocks\u201d. The result of this reduction is that the Respondent calculated the Appellant\u2019s income for 2009 on the basis that his assets had increased by $144,818.[7]\n[48] All of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets in 2009 was due to the addition of the $145,000 Three-plex. There was no material change in any of the Appellant\u2019s other business or personal assets. In addition, there was no material change in the Appellant\u2019s liabilities in 2009.\n[49] Schedule I of the net worth calculation shows the Appellant\u2019s assets increasing from $718,410 at December 31, 2009 to $1,080,932 at December 31, 2010\u2013an increase of $362,522. However, Ms. Douglas subsequently reduced this amount by $194,500 to take into account her double counting of the asset shown on Schedule I as \u201cAoartment [sic] Block \u2013 4 plex at 235 Crossley\u201d (the \u201cFour\u2011plex\u201d). Similar to the double counting of the Three-plex, the double counting with respect to the Four-plex occurred when the Four-plex was included twice in the asset schedule: once in the amount shown as \u201cUCC per Schedule 1a \u2013 CCA\u201d and a second time as \u201cAoartment [sic] Block \u2013 4 plex 235 Crossley\u201d.\n[50] The Appellant testified that this was a four-plex rental unit that he had built in 2010. The $194,500 reduction is shown on Schedule V under the heading \u201cDeduct: Known audit adjustments, Other \u2013 Apartment block\u201d. The result of this reduction is that the Respondent calculated the Appellant\u2019s income for 2010 on the basis that his assets had increased by $168,022.[8]\n[51] Ms. Douglas\u2019s calculations actually understated the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets by $19,500. The $194,500 reduction for the double counting in the 2010 calculation is composed of her calculation of the cost of the Four-plex ($175,000) plus the cost of the land that the Appellant purchased in 2010 to build the Four-plex on ($19,500). However, Ms. Douglas did not double count the cost of the land; she only double counted the cost of the Four-plex itself.\n[52] Regardless, all of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets in 2010 was due to the addition of the land at 235 Crossley and the construction of the Four-plex on the land. There was no material change to the Appellant\u2019s liabilities in 2010.\n[53] The Appellant\u2019s assets at the end of 2011 were approximately the same as his assets at the end of 2010. The only difference was the sale of an undeveloped lot that he had owned for a number of years. There also was no material change in his liabilities in 2011.\n[54] In summary, all of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth in 2009, 2010 and 2011 was due to the construction of the Three-plex and the Four-plex and the acquisition of the land for the Four-plex.\n[55] Counsel for the Appellant argued that even after the adjustments were made by Ms. Douglas, there had been a double counting of the Three-plex in 2010. The above analysis shows that there was no double counting of the Three-plex after Ms. Douglas made her adjustments. The increase in net worth during the relevant periods corresponds with the only assets added during these periods, namely the Three\u2011plex and the Four-plex. The Appellant\u2019s liabilities had no impact on the change in his net worth since they remained relatively constant throughout the relevant periods.\n[56] The amounts shown as personal expenditures in Schedule III of the net worth calculation comprise over 90% of the adjustments made to the calculated change in net worth for each of the relevant years. In fact, the total of the increase in net worth caused by the addition of the Three-plex and the Four-plex and the total of the personal expenditures exceeds the total of the calculated unreported business income in each year. In other words, any calculated unreported income for the relevant years is solely dependent on the addition of the Three-plex, the addition of the Four-plex and the calculated personal expenditures. There are no other material numbers in the net worth calculation.\n[57] I will first address the inclusion of the Three-plex and the Four-plex in the calculation of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth in 2009 and 2010.\n[58] The Appellant testified that he built the Three-plex and the Four-plex as rental properties.\n[59] The Appellant built the Three-plex at 213 Crossley Avenue in The Pas in 2009. The Appellant accepts that he acquired the land at 213 Crossley Avenue sometime before December 31, 2008, at a cost of $14,000.\n[60] The Appellant built the Four-plex at 235 Crossley in The Pas in 2010. The Appellant accepts that he acquired the land at 235 Crossley in 2010 at a cost of $19,500.\n[61] Ms. Douglas testified that during the audit, the Appellant informed her that he built the Three-plex in 2009 at a cost of between $140,000 and $150,000. She then, in her words, \u201csplit it down the middle\u201d and chose a 2009 construction cost of $145,000.\n[62] Similarly, the Appellant informed Ms. Douglas that he built the Four-plex in 2010 at a cost of between $170,000 and $180,000. She once again \u201csplit it down the middle\u201d and chose a 2010 construction cost of $175,000.\n[63] The Appellant did not provide the Court with reliable objective evidence that would demolish the Respondent\u2019s assumption that the cost of the Three-plex was approximately $145,000 and that the cost of the Four-plex was approximately $175,000.\n[64] Exhibit A-53 contains 175 pages of invoices that the Appellant testified related to the construction of the Three-plex. Exhibit A-54 contains approximately 400 pages of invoices that the Appellant testified related to the construction of the Four-plex.\n[65] The majority of the invoices in Exhibits A-53 and A-54 are for less than $500, and many are for less then $100. None of the invoices show the purchased materials being delivered to 213 or 235 Crossley Avenue.\n[66] I was not provided with a ledger or any schedule showing the costs of the various components of either building. Further, I was not provided with any objective evidence tying the invoices into the costs incurred to construct the Three\u2011plex and the Four-plex. I have no way of knowing whether the invoices include all of the costs of the Three-plex and Four-plex or whether they even relate to the construction of the two buildings. Some or all of the invoices could have related to the Appellant\u2019s contracting business.\n[67] The self-serving evidence of the Appellant alone, whom I found not to be a credible witness, is not sufficient for me to conclude that the invoices represent the total cost of the Three-plex and Four-plex or that all invoices relate to the construction of the two buildings.\n[68] The Appellant was asked during his examination-in- chief how he funded the construction of the two buildings. He stated the following:\nI \u2013 I did have some lots, and I sold the lots, and they were \u2013 so some of the money come from there. I borrowed some money from my mother-in-law, I borrowed money from my brother-in-law, I borrowed money from my dad, and when the threeplex \u2013 when \u2013 once the first building was up, the threeplex and we were getting rent from it, all of my rent \u2013 so I would get roughly about $3,000 a month, and then all that money from the rent would go straight into be \u2013 buy \u2013 buying material for the fourplex. And that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 and then \u2013 I was short money, so I would borrow money.[9]\n[69] The Appellant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his testimony during his discovery by the Respondent\u2019s counsel. When asked during his discovery examination how he funded the cost of the Three-plex and the Four-plex, he stated that he used his line of credit. During his cross-examination before the Court, he stated that he did not recall telling counsel during his discovery that he had used his line of credit.[10] This is one of many examples of instances where the Appellant\u2019s testimony before the Court contradicted his sworn testimony during discovery. These contradictions seriously damaged his credibility.\n[70] When asked whether he had any loan agreements with his family members the Appellant stated that he believed he had one with his mother-in-law.\n[71] The Appellant acknowledged that Ms. Douglas asked him to provide loan documents. He noted that the loans were just verbal; there were no documents. He also acknowledged that he could not show Ms. Douglas deposits on his bank statements that represented amounts received as loans.\n[72] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s verbal evidence that he received loans from family members. It is not supported by the objective evidence, particularly the fact that his bank statements do not show amounts received as loans being deposited into his account.\n[73] It is also damaging to the Appellant that he did not call a family member to testify that he or she made loans to the Appellant.\n[74] I have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before me, that the Appellant self\u2011funded the construction of the Three-plex and the Four-plex. The net worth calculation is consistent with this assumption.\n[75] With respect to rental income from the Three-plex, the Appellant\u2019s income tax return for 2009 showed no revenue from the Three-plex. His tax return for 2010 shows gross rental revenue of $17,970 and net income after expenses of $13,810. The Appellant may have used all or a portion of the $13,810 to pay for costs incurred to construct the Four-plex. In fact, the net worth calculation credits him for this income by reducing his unreported income by the amount of income (including rental income) reported on his 2010 tax return.\n[76] With respect to the line of credit, the Appellant acknowledged during his cross-examination that he could not have used the line since the balance in the line of credit was around $125,000 from December 2008 to the end of 2011. The $125,000 was the maximum amount that the Appellant was entitled to borrow under the line of credit.\n[77] For the foregoing reasons, I have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before the Court, that the Respondent has properly accounted for the Three-plex and the Four-plex when calculating the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth.\n[78] I will now address the positive adjustment made to the net worth calculation in respect of personal expenditures. In assessing the Appellant, the Minister assumed that the Appellant incurred personal expenditures of $220,013, $329,499 and $206,804 in his 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years, respectively.\n[79] Ms. Douglas explained that she used a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d analysis to determine the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures. This involved her reviewing the Appellant\u2019s bank statements, credit card statements and any of his other financial statements. She identified any withdrawals on the statements and categorized each withdrawal as a business expense, a personal expense or a transfer. Transfers were transfers between various accounts and were not included in the calculation of the Appellant\u2019s personal expenses or business expenses.\n[80] She then tried to group the personal expenses into 13 specific categories such as food, shelter, household operations, and clothing. Any withdrawals that she could not identify as business expenses or as expenses related to one of the 13 personal categories were included in miscellaneous personal expenses.\n[81] Ms. Douglas prepared detailed spreadsheets showing how she categorized each withdrawal noted on the Appellant\u2019s bank and credit card statements.[11] These spreadsheets were provided to the Appellant.\n[82] Ms. Douglas testified that she made the following assumptions when analyzing the bank statements and other financial records of the Appellant:\n-All expenses that were evidenced by invoices from one of his suppliers of building materials, such as Northern Building Supply, Home Hardware, and Timber Mart, were classified as business expenses. She did not try to determine if any of these invoices were in respect of personal expenditures.\n-She did not try to distinguish between business expenses incurred in respect of the Appellant\u2019s contracting business and business expenses incurred in the construction or maintenance of the two rental properties.\n-If the Appellant provided a cheque with respect to a specific withdrawal, then the cheque would be used to classify the withdrawal. If the cheque was payable to one of the suppliers of building materials or equipment, then the withdrawal was classified as a business expense. The withdrawals evidenced by the remaining cheques were placed in the appropriate personal expenditure category. For example, if the cheque was made payable to IGA, the withdrawal was included in the food category.\n-After discussing with the Appellant the items that he purchased at Costco, Ms. Douglas decided that any payments to Costco over $300 would be classified as business expenses, while payments under $300 would be classified as personal expenses.\n-Ms. Douglas decided that any cash withdrawals over $800 were business expenses. This was based on the assumption that the Appellant\u2019s bank limited the maximum amount of a single transaction on his debit card to $800. As a result, the Appellant was required to withdraw cash to purchase goods or services that cost in excess of $800.\n[83] Exhibits R-53, R-54, R-55, R-58, R-63 and R-64 evidence that Ms. Douglas examined over 1,300 pages of invoices from the Appellant\u2019s suppliers of building materials. Exhibits R-26, R-27 and R-28 contain Ms. Douglas\u2019s spreadsheets summarizing the withdrawals that she identified as business expenses. These spreadsheets show that Ms. Douglas identified 33 suppliers of business materials and services in 2009 and 35 in 2010 and 2011.\n[84] Exhibit R-23 contains a summary of Ms. Douglas\u2019s analysis of the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and other financial statements; it shows the following:\n-In 2009, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $386,083 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $166,070 were business expenses and $220,012 were personal expenses.\n-In 2010, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $635,145 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $305,646 were business expenses and $329,498 were personal expenses.\n-In 2011, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $389,049 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $182,246 were business expenses and $206,804 were personal expenses.\n[85] Ms. Douglas categorized a substantial amount of the personal expenses as miscellaneous expenditures: $148,348 in 2009, $244,364 in 2010 and $146,813 in 2011.\n[86] During his examination-in-chief of the Appellant, counsel for the Appellant noted that the Appellant is not disputing any of the personal expenditures other than the miscellaneous expenditures.[12] This concession in and of itself results in the Appellant having significant unreported income in 2009 and 2010. If I remove the miscellaneous personal expenses from the net worth calculation, the calculation results in $163,161 of unreported income in 2009 and $195,852 of unreported income in 2010.\n[87] Although the Appellant does not accept the amounts calculated for miscellaneous expenditures, he has produced no evidence to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption that the Appellant incurred the personal expenditures set out in Schedule IV to the Reply, which includes the miscellaneous expenditures. This is an assumption that the Minister made when assessing the Appellant. The Court must accept this assumption unless the Appellant presents evidence to \u201cdestroy\u201d it.\n[88] The Appellant has produced no such evidence. He testified that his position is that all expenses categorized as miscellaneous expenditures were in fact business expenses. He also testified that even though he was provided with Ms. Douglas\u2019s detailed calculation of the specific withdrawals that she classified as miscellaneous expenses, he did not inform the Respondent of any specific items that he disagreed with or provide him with any evidence to show that a specific item that Ms. Douglas classified as a miscellaneous personal expense was in fact a business expense. More importantly, the Appellant did not provide such evidence to the Court. The Court received no evidence from the Appellant with respect to any of the specific withdrawals that the Respondent classified as miscellaneous expenses. In such a situation, the Court accepts the Minister\u2019s assumption with respect to the amount of the miscellaneous expenditures.\n[89] Further, I have concluded, on the basis of Ms. Douglas\u2019s testimony and her working papers, that she took a fair and reasonable approach to calculating the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures using the information provided to her by the Appellant. She clearly spent a significant amount of time analyzing the Appellant\u2019s bank accounts, credit card statements and line of credit statements and provided the Appellant with numerous opportunities to clarify the nature of the various withdrawals.\n[90] Based on the foregoing, I accept the Minister\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures for each of the relevant years.\n[91] For the foregoing reasons, I also accept the Minister\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s unreported income. The calculations undertaken by Ms. Douglas are supported by the evidence before the Court and provide the only reliable evidence of the Appellant\u2019s income during the relevant years.\nAppellant\u2019s argument with respect to lifestyle\n[92] While my conclusion disposes of the appeal as it relates to unreported income, I will address the Appellant\u2019s main argument.\n[93] As discussed, the Appellant did not provide any reliable evidence to challenge Ms. Douglas\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s unreported net income. The Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that the Appellant\u2019s frugal lifestyle simply does not support the assessed amounts.\n[94] Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Appellant\u2019s family\u2019s primary sources of income were the income that the Appellant received from working full\u2011time as a Zamboni driver for the town of The Pas and the income that Mrs. Demchynski received from working as a housekeeper at a care centre. Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Appellant\u2019s lifestyle does not reflect the lifestyle of someone who had earned the unreported income determined by the net worth calculation. He also noted that there were no \u201cassets of extravagance\u201d in the net worth calculation.\n[95] The Appellant\u2019s argument is predicated on the assumption that the Appellant\u2019s family\u2019s primary source of income was the $21.51 per hour that he was paid by the town and the $15 per hour that Mrs. Demchynski earned working at the care centre. Counsel also relied heavily on the testimony of Mrs. Demchynski and the Appellant that the family lived a frugal lifestyle.\n[96] The nature of the lifestyle that a family leads has little relevance to the determination of whether they had unreported income. More importantly, the evidence before the Court contradicts the factual foundation of the Appellant\u2019s argument.\n[97] Firstly, I have found, as a question of fact, that the Appellant\u2019s primary source of income was his contracting business\u2013a business that had gross receipts well in excess of $1 million during the relevant period.\n[98] Secondly, the evidence before me is that the Appellant\u2019s family did not live a frugal lifestyle.\n[99] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s and Mrs. Demchynski\u2019s testimony during their examination-in-chief that they lived a frugal lifestyle. Their testimony was destroyed on cross-examination.\n[100] After numerous questions from counsel for the Respondent and frequent references to prior inconsistent statements made by the Appellant during his discovery examination, the Appellant finally admitted that he had spent a good deal of time at a time-share that the family owned in Las Vegas. I have concluded, on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s demeanour and his answers to counsel\u2019s questions during cross\u2011examination, that the evidence that he provided during his discovery is the most reliable evidence of the time that the family spent in Las Vegas, being eight weeks per year. In addition, I have concluded, on the basis of the cross\u2011examination, that the Appellant\u2019s interest in the time-share entitled him to stay four weeks per year at the time-share. He spent an additional $10,000 per year to purchase the additional four weeks per year that his family spent in Las Vegas at the time-share. This is not a frugal lifestyle.\n[101] The Appellant acknowledged on cross-examination that he purchased a home in Las Vegas in 2013. After he purchased the home, he retained the interest in the time-share. While I acknowledge that 2013 is outside of the relevant period, the fact that he purchased the home in 2013 is consistent with the evidence before me that he spent significant time in Las Vegas.\n[102] The Appellant\u2019s testimony with respect to Las Vegas is one of numerous instances where he attempted to hide from the Court his actual lifestyle. His evidence on this point seriously damaged his credibility.\n[103] As discussed previously, during the relevant period the Appellant built a Three\u2011plex and a Four\u2011plex at a cost of at least $320,000. There is no evidence before the Court that the Appellant borrowed any monies to fund the construction of the two complexes. They were self-funded. This may not be an \u201casset of extravagance\u201d, but the self-funding of this acquisition during the relevant period is not consistent with the income that the Appellant reported on his income tax returns.\n[104] Regardless of the Appellant\u2019s actual lifestyle, I have accepted Ms. Douglas\u2019s net worth calculation. It is the only reliable evidence before me of the Appellant\u2019s income during the relevant periods.\nPenalties under subsection 163(2)\n[105] Subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty on every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a tax return.\n[106] The Federal Court of Appeal noted in Wynter v. Canada,[13] that the knowledge requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer had an actual intent to make a false statement or the taxpayer is wilfully blind. The court explained that:\nA taxpayer is wilfully blind in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth. The concept is one of deliberate ignorance. \u2026\n\u2026 wilful blindness pivots on a finding that the taxpayer deliberately chose not to make inquiries in order to avoid verifying that which might be such an inconvenient truth. The essential factual element is a finding of deliberate ignorance, as it \u201cconnotes \u2018an actual process of suppressing a suspicion.\u2019\u201d\n[107] The Federal Court of Appeal noted that gross negligence is distinct from wilful blindness. Gross negligence \u201c\u2026 arises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable taxpayer. \u2026\u201d[14]\n[108] Under subsection 163(3), the Minister has the burden of establishing the facts that justify the assessment of a penalty under subsection 163(2).\n[109] For the following reasons, I find that the Appellant knowingly made false statements in his income tax return for each of the relevant years. Specifically, he knowingly understated his income from his contracting business and failed to report his income in 2010 from the sale of the vacant lots.\n[110] In each of the relevant years, the Appellant\u2019s tax returns significantly understated his income from his contracting business.\n[111] In his 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns, the Appellant reported gross sales from his contracting business of $45,180, $45,814 and $54,225.80 respectively.[15] These numbers are clearly incorrect since, as discussed previously, the Appellant\u2019s gross income from his contracting business in 2009, 2010 and 2011 was at least $250,559, $451,356 and $209,692 respectively and appears to have been significantly higher.\n[112] With respect to expenses, the Appellant claimed, in his tax returns for 2009, 2010 and 2011, expenses in respect of his contracting business of $45,831, $47,105 and $66,549.99 respectively. The expenses shown on his statement of business or professional activities filed with his income tax return were composed of supplies; subcontracts; legal, accounting and other fees; telephone and utilities; fuel costs; salaries, wages and benefits; capital cost allowance; registration, repairs and gas for equipment; and interest.[16]\n[113] The Appellant then reported losses from his contracting business in his 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns of $651, $1,291.58 and $12,324.19 respectively.[17] The reporting of these losses constitutes a false statement. In each of these years, the Appellant realized a substantial profit from his contracting business. These profits constituted most of the unreported income of the Appellant.\n[114] The Appellant signed each of these tax returns, certifying that the information in each of the returns was correct, was complete, and fully disclosed all of his income. He testified that he reviewed the returns before they were filed.\n[115] The Appellant first testified that the gross revenue that appears on the income tax returns is actually his net profit from each job. He testified that he provided the accountant who prepared his tax returns with the net profit from his contracting business as opposed to the gross income and actual expenses from the business.\n[116] However, on cross-examination, counsel for the Respondent pointed out to the Appellant that he claimed on the statement of business or professional activities filed with his return a number of expenses in respect of his contracting business, such as supplies, subcontracts, salaries and wages, and equipment expenses. The Appellant then claimed that he was not sure how his income from his contracting business was reported on his tax return.\n[117] I have concluded, on the basis of the fact that each of the statements of business or professional activities that the Appellant filed with his income tax returns shows an amount for gross income and detailed expenses, that the statements are intended to report what they show, namely the gross income from the Appellant\u2019s contracting business and the expenses that he incurred in earning this gross income.\n[118] The Appellant testified that an accountant prepared his income tax returns. However, the space on each income tax return where a professional tax preparer acknowledges that he or she prepared the return is blank. Other than the Appellant\u2019s oral testimony, the Court has no evidence to support his assertion that an accountant prepared his tax returns.\n[119] Regardless, what is clear from the evidence before me is that the Appellant provided all of the information that was used to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income from his contracting business\u2013information that grossly understates his income from the business.\n[120] The Appellant consistently stated that he did not understand the information on his tax return. I do not accept this testimony. Clearly, he understood the information since he prepared it and provided it to the accountant.\n[121] I have concluded that as a question of fact, the Appellant knowingly understated the income from his contracting business that he reported on his income tax returns for each of the relevant years.\n[122] He also knowingly failed to report the profit that he realized in 2010 on the sale of the two lots discussed previously. The sales are not reported on the Appellant\u2019s 2010 tax return.\n[123] The Appellant claimed that the sale of the lots was included in his statement of business or professional activities. I do not accept this testimony. The Appellant provided no documentary evidence to show how he determined the loss from his business as reported on his tax return or to show the amount, if any, that he included as profit from the sale of the two lots.\n[124] Further, the gross proceeds from the sale of the two lots was $48,000, whereas the gross revenue reported on his statement of business or professional activities was $45,814. In other words, the statement of business or professional activities does not include the profit that the Appellant realized on the sale of the lots. He clearly realized a profit since between 2005 and 2010, he sold eight lots for gross proceeds of $154,000 that had a cost of $62,000.[18]\n[125] In summary, the Appellant is liable for the penalty imposed under subsection 163(2) in respect of his unreported income.\n[126] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed in part to incorporate the concessions made by the Respondent. The assessments are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the unreported income of the Appellant is as follows:\n-For the 2009 taxation year, the $311,509 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $7,007.46 concession made by the Respondent.\n-For the 2010 taxation year, the $440,216 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $23,101.65 concession made by the Respondent.\n-For the 2011 taxation year, the $142,184 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $16,503.74 concession made by the Respondent.\n[127] The parties have 60 days from the date of this judgment to make written representations with respect to the amount of costs that the Court should award the Respondent. The written submissions shall not exceed 15 pages. If no submissions are received, costs shall be awarded to the Respondent as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Edmonton, Alberta, this 14th day of February 2024.\n\u201cS.

The Canada Child Benefit [1] Parliament created the Canada Child Benefit (the \u201cCCB\u201d) as an income-tested tax-free monthly payment administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. The rules surrounding the CCB are found in Subdivision A.1 of the Income Tax Act.[1]\n[2] The CCB was introduced in 2016 to replace the Canada Child Tax Benefit (the \u201cCCTB\u201d) and the Universal Child Care Benefit (the \u201cUCCB\u201d).[2] The CCB differs most significantly from the prior programs in that it is income-based and non-taxable.[3]\n[3] To receive the CCB, the taxpayer must live with a child who is under 18 years of age, be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of the child, be a resident of Canada for tax purposes, and be or be the spouse or common-law spouse of someone who is: a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, a protected person, or a temporary resident, within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act[4], or an individual who is registered, or entitled to be registered, under the Indian Act.[5]\nB. Part A \u2013 CCB Eligibility [4] Part A of this appeal determines whether refugee claimants are included in the constructive definition of temporary resident and, therefore, are entitled to the CCB.\n[5] The Minister excluded Ms. Yao and Ms. Zhang (the \u201cAppellants\u201d) during the relevant periods from the CCB because they were not temporary residents. The rationale is that, as refugee claimants, they were persons not clothed with a status of sufficient permanence under the IRPA to provide a nexus to Canada above a threshold embedded within the concept of temporary resident.\n[6] The Appellants argue that a textual, contextual, and purposive reading of the CCB provisions reveals that refugee claimants are included in the definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d and are therefore eligible for the CCB.\nC. Part B \u2013 Constitutional Challenge Under Sections 7 and 15 of the Charter [7] Part B of this appeal determines whether the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[6]\n[8] The Appellants claim that interpreting the ITA and the IRPA to exclude refugee claimants from the CCB contravenes their right to security of the person under section 7 of the Charter in a way that is not within the principles of fundamental justice.\n[9] The Appellants also claim that the denying of the CCB contravenes their right to equality under section 15 of the Charter on the enumerated ground of race or on an analogous grounds of immigration status.\nPreliminary Note: Intervenor [10] Throughout these reasons, the position of the Appellants are described as such. To clarify, at the hearing the Intervenor, through counsel, almost invariably proffered submissions -- there was no examination or cross-examination by Intervenor counsel, although offered -- which differed only slightly from counsel for the Appellants, or were entirely compatible. To the extent the Court determines it relevant, specific reference is made to the Intervenor\u2019s submissions.\nII. FACTS IN GENERAL A. CCB Process and Refugee Claimants [11] There are no material facts in dispute in these appeals. It would be simple to list the facts in a truncated narrative form. To do so in these appeals would be facile and unappreciative. The manifest struggle of refugee claimants is a frequent story in Canada, frequently informed and authored by the insensitive political, legal and\/or economic structures of foreign regimes. Therefore, although less time might be spent on the facts of the Appellants\u2019 specific stories, the Court expends some effort to ensure that the stories are told.\nB. Refugee Claimant Status [12] At the relevant times, Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were refugee claimants. For part of the period, Ms. Yao was also challenging the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \u201cIRB\u201d), which rejected her refugee claim, in the Federal Court of Canada (\u201cFederal Court\u201d). Ms. Yao\u2019s son, however, was a Canadian citizen at all times.\nC. CCTB or CCB Claim Process [13] A resident of Canada must actively apply for the CCB. The application form for the CCB or, as it was previously named the CCTB, is form RC66. In the application form, the claimant must state whether they (and their spouse or common-law partner) are citizens of Canada. If they are not citizens, or if they recently became new residents of Canada or returned as residents to Canada in the last two years, then they must complete another form: Status in Canada\/Statement of Income form RC66SCl-L.\n[14] In processing an application for the CCTB or the CCB, the CRA does not ask the claimant why they came to Canada.\nD. Ms. Yao a) Ms. Yao\u2019s background [15] Ms. Yao married in Canada in August 2014. She and her husband were citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). Their son was born in Toronto in 2015. Therefore, the son is a Canadian citizen, while neither Ms. Yao nor her husband are or were.\n[16] While residing with Ms. Yao, the husband was issued temporary work permits by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d).\n[17] Ms. Yao entered Canada on foot near Vancouver, British Columbia in August 2012. She did not hold a permanent resident visa as required under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations in order to establish permanent resident status. She claimed refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[18] On March 20, 2014, the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB determined that Ms. Yao was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nb) Ms. Yao\u2019s refugee claim history [19] On April 1, 2014, Ms. Yao appealed the Refugee Protection Division decision to the Refugee Appeal Division of the IRB. Later that month, the Refugee Appeal Division dismissed her appeal. In response, Ms. Yao filed an application for leave and judicial review of the decision, logically to stave off deportation.\n[20] On March 12, 2015, the Federal Court granted Ms. Yao\u2019s application for leave and judicial review of the Refugee Protection Division decision. In September of 2015, the Federal Court granted the application for leave and judicial review of the Refugee Protection Division decision. On September 22, 2015, Ms. Yao was issued a new work permit by IRCC. She was issued subsequent temporary work permits in seriatim for the period from the original work permit in 2015 until she was declared a refugee on September 4, 2019.\nc) Ms. Yao\u2019s CCTB (now CCB) claim history [21] Ms. Yao applied for the CCTB, in respect of her son, retroactive to March 30, 2015.\n[22] On August 20, 2015, the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) issued to Ms. Yao a Notice of Determination, which identified the amount to which Ms. Yao was entitled in respect of the CCTB. In February 2016, the Minister terminated payments to Ms. Yao under the CCTB. On July 1, 2016, the CCTB was replaced with the CCB.\n[23] On August 19, 2016, the Minister redetermined Ms. Yao\u2019s entitlement and requested that Ms. Yao repay overpayments of the CCB totalling $1,199.21. In June 2017, Ms. Yao served a Notice of Objection and a request for an extension of time to file her Notice of Objection. In July 2017, the CRA granted Ms. Yao\u2019s application for an extension of time to file her Notice of Objection, and requested documentation supporting her eligibility for the CCB. After Ms. Yao responded, the Minister issued a Notice of Confirmation, confirming the redetermination of Ms. Yao\u2019s eligibility and effectively denying her the CCB on the basis of her status as a refugee claimant.\nd) Ms. Yao\u2019s testimony concerning her challenges [24] Ms. Yao, like most refugee claimants, has had considerable financial challenges, arriving virtually penniless in a new country and unable to speak either official language. She attempted to reduce the language barrier by taking English lessons when she arrived in 2012. Although irrelevant to her appeal, her process for entry into Canada was unorthodox and suspect, and involved some unscrupulous actors. She paid some $20,000 to $30,000 Canadian to an illicit Chinese immigration \u201cconsultant\u201d, commonly known as a \u201csnakehead.\u201d\n[25] In 2014, Ms. Yao married. She and her husband separated sometime in 2017 or so. During that period, the family supported itself through her husband\u2019s intermittent income of $2,000 to $3,000 per month. She herself was employed selling skincare products. Her income was $1,000 per month or less. More recently, her income has become more stable.\n[26] During 2015 and 2016, Ms. Yao was originally paid the CCB (then the CCTB). The money assisted her with necessities. After the benefit was terminated, her testimony was that she resorted to second-hand stores, borrowed items and community help. During that period, she was sad, anxious and without much hope. By contrast, now that the benefit has been restored, swimming lessons, marital arts lessons, piano lessons and golf lessons are within reach financially. Healthcare was always accessible.\n[27] Her accommodation has changed as well. In 2014, she lived in the basement of a semi-detached house. In 2016, she moved to a large condominium. In this location, she had security, parking and close proximity (less than a block) to her son\u2019s school. In 2017, she again relocated to a two-storey house with a basement, double-car garage and a backyard. She lives there presently.\nE. Ms. Zhang a) Ms. Zhang\u2019s background [28] Ms. Zhang and her children\u2019s pathway to refugee status is slightly more straightforward. The period in issue for Ms. Zhang is March 2018 to May 2019. During that time, she was a refugee claimant, and like all refugee claimants, under a conditional departure order.\n[29] Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were essentially in the same position as Ms. Zhang to the extent that they had no different \u201cimmigration status\u201d than their mother. Her children were both born in China, her daughter in 2010 and her son in 2012.\n[30] Ms. Zhang divorced her husband, himself a Chinese citizen who never resided in Canada, in early 2018. At that time, Ms. Zhang was granted sole custody of her children by court order.\nb) Ms. Zhang\u2019s refugee claim history [31] From April 2013 to October 2014, Ms. Zhang and her children were in Canada by virtue of Ms. Zhang\u2019s study permit and V-1 visitor permits. Ms. Zhang and her children were all back in China by August 2014, prior to the expiration of the permits.\n[32] In May 2017, Ms. Zhang claimed refugee protection under the IRPA. She and her children received a refugee claimant document and qualified for interim federal healthcare. A conditional departure order was also issued.\n[33] From summer 2017 to October 2020, various work and study permits were issued, expired and\/or were extended. Finally, in December of 2020, Ms. Zhang was issued a study permit, valid until August 31, 2023. It stated on its face, like all the others, that it \u201cdoes not confer temporary resident status\u201d.\nc) Ms. Zhang\u2019s CCB claim history [34] Ms. Zhang applied for the CCB in respect of her children in May 2017. On July 20, 2017, the Minister issued to Ms. Zhang a Notice of Determination, stating that she was not entitled to the CCB for the 2016 base year.\n[35] This Notice of Determination is not under appeal.\n[36] Ms. Zhang again applied for the CCB in respect of her children by application dated May 4, 2018. On July 20, 2018, the Minister issued a Notice of Determination, notifying Ms. Zhang that she was entitled to the CCB for the 2016 base year. In 2018, a similar notice advised Ms. Zhang that she qualified for the 2017 base year.\n[37] On September 20, 2019, the Minister changed her mind and notified Ms. Zhang that she was not entitled to the CCB for the 2016 and 2017 base years. On November 13, 2019, Ms. Zhang served a Notice of Objection in respect of the notices of determination disentitling her to the CCB. The Minister subsequently confirmed the denial of the CCB for the 2016 and 2017 base taxation years.\nd) Ms. Zhang\u2019s testimony concerning her challenges [38] The purpose of Ms. Zhang\u2019s second entry into Canada in August 2016 with her two children was twofold. Firstly, she wanted to study in Canada from August to December 2016. Secondly, and more existentially, she was fleeing an intolerable domestic arrangement, greater details of which are constrained by this Court\u2019s own confidentiality order.\n[39] From 2017 until 2020, Ms. Zhang and her children lived in a secure living arrangement. Ultimately, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice awarded her sole custody under various protective court orders.\n[40] During the years from 2018 to 2020, Ms. Zhang pursued her post-graduate studies and further continued her professional education in the fall of 2020.\n[41] Her financial situation during these years was precarious. She used supports from parents, her community, food banks and churches to survive financially. She described her situation as \u201cvery tight\u201d financially. She was an excellent student and received numerous bursaries and awards. The CCB moneys, when received for an interim period, were used for better clothing, groceries such as fresh fruits and vegetables and, of particular pride, extracurricular activities for her children.\n[42] Ultimately, after the relevant periods ended, in 2019 and 2020, the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB determined that Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were Convention refugees.\n[43] This meant that refugee protection was conferred on them and they became protected persons within the meaning of the IRPA. This also meant that Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children became eligible individuals for the purposes of the CCB, under subparagraph 122.6(e)(iii) of the ITA.\nIII. PART A \u2013 CCB ELIGIBILITY [44] At a high level, the first specific issue in these appeals is:\nDid Ms. Yao and\/or Ms. Zhang, as refugee claimants, qualify as eligible individuals within the meaning of subparagraph 122.6(e) of the ITA?\nA. Meaning of Temporary Resident [45] The determination of who qualifies for the CCB is governed by the ITA, the IRPA, and the Regulations thereunder. The ITA defines \u201celigible individual\u201d to include a \u201ctemporary resident within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u201d. However, \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not explicitly defined in the IRPA.\n[46] The Appellants, as refugee claimants, argue that they fall within the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Accordingly, the issue before this Court is whether, under subparagraph 122.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, a refugee claimant is a temporary resident within the meaning of the IRPA and is therefore eligible for the CCB.\na) Excerpt from the ITA [47] Eligible individuals are entitled to apply for the CCB pursuant to section 122.6 of the ITA. Paragraph 122.6(e) defines \u201celigible individual\u201d as follows:\neligible individual in respect of a qualified dependent at any time means a person who at that time\n\u2026\n(e) is, or whose cohabiting spouse or common-law partner is, a Canadian citizen or a person who\n(i) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\n(ii) is a temporary resident within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, who was resident in Canada throughout the 18 month period preceding that time,\n(iii) is a protected person within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\n(iv) was determined before that time to be a member of a class defined in the Humanitarian Designated Classes Regulations made under the Immigration Act, or\n(v) is an Indian within the meaning of the Indian Act,\n[Emphasis added.]\nb)Excerpts from the IRPA [48] The IRPA does not define \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Instead, the IRPA describes the process and means by which one becomes a temporary resident.\n[49] Section 22 authorizes an immigration officer (\u201cIO\u201d) to determine whether a foreign national qualifies to be a temporary resident.\nTemporary resident\n22 (1) A foreign national becomes a temporary resident if an officer is satisfied that the foreign national has applied for that status, has met the obligations set out in paragraph 20(1)(b), is not inadmissible and is not the subject of a declaration made under subsection 22.1(1).\nDual intent\n(2) An intention by a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n[50] Section 24 provides that an IO may grant a temporary resident permit.\nTemporary resident permit\n24 (1) A foreign national who, in the opinion of an officer, is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of this Act becomes a temporary resident if an officer is of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances and issues a temporary resident permit, which may be cancelled at any time.\nException\n(2) A foreign national referred to in subsection (1) to whom an officer issues a temporary resident permit outside Canada does not become a temporary resident until they have been examined upon arrival in Canada.\nInstructions of Minister\n(3) In applying subsection (1), the officer shall act in accordance with any instructions that the Minister may make.\nRestriction \u2014 pending application for protection\n(3.1) A foreign national whose claim for refugee protection has been determined to be ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division may not request a temporary resident permit if they have made an application for protection to the Minister that is pending.\nRestriction\n(4) A foreign national whose claim for refugee protection has not been allowed may not request a temporary resident permit if less than 12 months have passed since\n(a) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Protection Division, in the case where no appeal was made and no application was made to the Federal Court for leave to commence an application for judicial review; or\n(b) in any other case, the latest of\n(i) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Protection Division or, if there was more than one such rejection or determination, the day on which the last one occurred,\n(ii) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Appeal Division or, if there was more than one such rejection or determination, the day on which the last one occurred, and\n(iii) the day on which the Federal Court refused their application for leave to commence an application for judicial review, or denied their application for judicial review, with respect to their claim.\nRestriction \u2014 designated foreign national\n(5) A designated foreign national may not request a temporary resident permit\n(a) if they have made a claim for refugee protection but have not made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the claim is made;\n(b) if they have made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the application is made; or\n(c) in any other case, until five years after the day on which the foreign national becomes a designated foreign national.\nSuspension of request\n(6) The processing of a request for a temporary resident permit of a foreign national who, after the request is made, becomes a designated foreign national is suspended\n(a) if the foreign national has made a claim for refugee protection but has not made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the claim is made;\n(b) if the foreign national has made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the application is made; or\n(c) in any other case, until five years after the day on which the foreign national becomes a designated foreign national.\nRefusal to consider request\n(7) The officer may refuse to consider a request for a temporary resident permit if\n(a) the designated foreign national fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any condition imposed on them under subsection 58(4) or section 58.1 or any requirement imposed on them under section 98.1; and\nb) less than 12 months have passed since the end of the applicable period referred to in subsection (5) or (6).\n[51] Subsection 46(1.1) provides that automatic conferral of temporary resident status occurs after renunciation of permanent resident status.\nEffect of renunciation\n46(1.1) A person who loses their permanent resident status under paragraph (1)(e) becomes a temporary resident for a period of six months unless they make their application to renounce their permanent resident status at a port of entry or are not physically present in Canada on the day on which their application is approved.\n[52] Certain protected refugees are granted temporary resident status under subsection 95(1).\nConferral of refugee protection\n95 (1) Refugee protection is conferred on a person when\n(a) the person has been determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances under a visa application and becomes a permanent resident under the visa or a temporary resident under a temporary resident permit for protection reasons;\n(b) the Board determines the person to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection; or\n(c) except in the case of a person described in subsection 112(3), the Minister allows an application for protection.\n[53] This list is exhaustive and is not open and flexible. Notably, temporary resident status requires an IO or Board decision.\nc) Jurisprudence 1. Leading Authority [54] Almadhoun v. Canada [7] is the leading case resolving whether a refugee claimant is a temporary resident within the meaning of the IRPA. In Almadhoun, the Federal Court of Appeal (the \u201cFCA\u201d) agreed with the Tax Court that a refugee claimant is not a temporary resident and is therefore not an eligible individual for the purposes of section 122.6 of the ITA. The FCA, at paragraphs 17 and 18, held:\n[17] \u2026 There is absolutely nothing in the legislation to support the appellant\u2019s assertion that section 122.6 of the Act necessarily includes a person whose application for status as a protected person is pending, and the appellant was unable to provide any case law in support of her contention. Contrary to Ms. Almadhoun\u2019s argument, there is no gap in the legislation; Parliament made a conscious policy choice as to the groups of persons on whom social benefits would be conferred. It is not for this Court to second-guess that deliberate choice \u2026\n[18] The same reasoning applies in response to the appellant\u2019s second argument, namely that she should be considered at the very least a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d with the meaning of the IRPA. The IRPA provides a process for the determination of temporary residency, which is not an open and flexible category. \u2026\n[55] The Appellants correctly recognize that in order to depart from vertical precedent, including decisions of the FCA, it is not enough to be manifestly wrong.[8] The appeal must raise a new legal issue, or present new evidence that will \u201cfundamentally shift how jurists understand the legal question at issue.\u201d[9] The question at issue is admittedly a question of law, so new evidence cannot help.\n[56] Where the same legal issue before the Tax Court is re-litigated, Almadhoun is binding, except in rare circumstances.[10] The Appellants cite the Supreme Court of Canada case Bedford[11] to assert that raising a new \u201ccritical statutory provision\u201d is just such a sufficiently rare circumstance that applies in this case.[12] In Almadhoun, the Court did not analyze the relevant IRPA provisions, the Convention on the Rights of the Child[13] or statements of legislative intent. Further, Almadhoun was limited to on a strict textual interpretation of \u201celigible individual\u201d.\n[57] The Respondent argues that because the issue in Almadhoun is the same issue before this Court, Almadhoun is binding on this Court.[14] Accordingly, a refugee claimant is not included in the meaning of temporary resident under the IRPA and is therefore not eligible for the CCB.\nAnalysis\n[58] Almadhoun is prima facie binding on this Court. The FCA specifically considered subparagraph 122.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, the same statutory provision raised in this appeal. This leads to the same issue being squarely before the Court: whether, under subparagraph 112.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, a refugee claimant is a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d within the meaning of the IRPA.\n[59] The Appellants\u2019 assertion that raising a new \u201ccritical statutory provision\u201d allows a court to reconsider a settled issue is not founded in jurisprudence. It is partially correct that the Tax Court can depart from vertical precedent \u201cif new legal issues are raised as a consequence of significant developments in the law, or if there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate.\u201d[15] However, Bedford was about Charter provisions, not about \u201ccritical provisions\u201d from legislation in general.\n[60] To expand upon the Appellants\u2019 quotation from Bedford, \u201ca trial judge can consider and decide arguments based on Charter provisions that were not raised in the earlier case; this constitutes a new legal issue.\u201d[16] Raising a new Charter challenge is more than just highlighting a different statutory provision; it raises a new independent claim. Further, the \u201csignificant development in the law\u201d in Bedford allowing precedent to be re-argued was the development of jurisprudence on the \u201cprinciples of fundamental justice\u201d which significantly changed the s. 7 analysis.\n[61] Identifying other provisions of the IRPA does not create new issues in the way that bringing a claim under the Charter or under a different Charter provision does. Further, the CRC and all documents regarding legislative intent were available at the time Almadhoun was heard, so no significant change in the law is apparent. Although the FCA\u2019s discussion on the \u201ctemporary resident\u201d provision is short, that alone is not enough to overturn the binding precedent on the basis of new legislative facts or legislative amendments, when factually such terrain was identical when viewed by the FCA.\n[62] To overturn vertical precedent, there must be a new issue raised, or a change in the law or circumstances that \u201cfundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate.\u201d[17] The Appellants assert that the FCA incorrectly interpreted the legislation because it did not look at other materials such as other sections of the IRPA, the CRC, and other documents indicating legislative intent.[18] This is insufficient to overturn binding precedent. As a result, Almadhoun is binding on this Court.\nd) Interpretation of the Statutes [63] The question of whether refugee claimants are \u201ctemporary residents\u201d and therefore \u201celigible individuals\u201d under s. 122.6 can only be reconsidered if Almadhoun is not binding on this Court because the Court is prepared to distinguish it. For completeness, and despite the binding nature of Almadhoun, the Court pursues this issue.\n[64] This is an issue of statutory interpretation. The Appellants argue that the interpretation should look beyond the text of the provision. The Court should take a contextual and purposive approach to resolve ambiguity.[19] The Appellants also assert that further ambiguities should be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.[20] Benefit schemes should be given a large and liberal interpretation, and such an approach has been applied to the CCB regime in the past.[21]\n[65] In Qu\u00e9bec (Communaut\u00e9 urbaine) v. Corp Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours,[22] the Supreme Court set out the principles which are to govern interpretation of tax legislation. The Court found that the interpretation of tax legislation should follow the ordinary rules of interpretation and that the choice between a strict or liberal reading of the text must not be guided by presumptions favourable to the state or the taxpayer, but by reference to the goal which underlies the provision.[23]\n[66] The ordinary rule of statutory interpretation is that \u201c[t]he words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.\u201d[24] The first step is to examine the text of the provision to determine its plain or ordinary meaning. However, the true meaning of the words can only be determined contextually by considering other indicators of legislative meaning, including context, purpose, and relevant legal norms.[25]\n1. Immigration vs. Tax Issue [67] Before discussing the text, context, and purpose, it is necessary to resolve the extent to which the Court should look at the IRPA and the functioning of the immigration regime to interpret this ITA provision.\n[68] The Appellants argue that it is incorrect to look at the IRPA to resolve ambiguity about the ITA. The interpretation should focus on the CCB regime as this is not an immigration law case.[26] The Appellants cite the Alberta Court of Appeal (\u201cABCA\u201d) decision Alberta v. ENMAX[27] as authority that the focus should be on the purpose and context of the ITA \u2013specifically the CCB regime\u2013 and not the IRPA and its immigration regime.[28]\n[69] ENMAX focused on a provision of Alberta\u2019s provincial energy regulation regime (the \u201cprimary regime\u201d). This provision required a calculation of \u201can amount equal to the amount of tax\u201d that an entity would be liable to pay under the ITA (the \u201csecondary regime\u201d).[29] To calculate that amount payable, the trial judge \u201ceffectively determined that anything outside the ITA was irrelevant\u201d.[30] The ABCA instead used the purpose and context informing the primary regime, resulting in a calculation that was different than if it had been done for income tax purposes instead.\n[70] The Respondent asserts that the phrase \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u201d invites and directs the Court to look at the entirety of the IRPA to determine the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Further, Parliament has the right to determine immigration policy. Assigning the term \u201ctemporary resident\u201d a meaning other than what it means in the IRPA will undermine that right and affect Canada\u2019s immigration policy while ingoing the use of such definition.\n[71] In ENMAX, the ABCA did not ignore the secondary regime. Rather, the Court looked at the context and purpose of the primary regime and found that the ITA calculation would have contravened that purpose. The purpose and context of the secondary regime need not be ignored, it just ought not to undermine the primary regime\u2019s purpose.\n[72] By analogy in these appeals, the CCB provisions of the ITA create the primary regime, and the IRPA is the secondary regime. To determine the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, the overall purpose and context of the CCB cannot be ignored and the IRPA cannot be applied in a vacuum.\n[73] Ultimately, the process is such that Parliament directs the reader from the primary regime to another regime, but only so far as it approaches the issue of defining \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, a concept more proximate to immigration law in this context than tax law. This ostensibly seeks consistency between legislation of the same law-making body and not the reverse.\n2. Text [74] The Appellants argue that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is ambiguous because, although section 122.6 refers to a temporary resident \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\u201d the IRPA does not contain a definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d.[31] While the IRPA sets out multiple methods of becoming a temporary resident, there is no indication that this is an exhaustive list.[32] The Court should not apply expressio unius (implied exclusion) to treat this as an exhaustive list.[33] Further, the IRPA itself has some confusing and inconsistent provisions regarding temporary residents.[34]\n[75] The Respondent argues that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not ambiguous.[35] The IRPA sets out a finite number of ways to acquire temporary resident status.[36] All these methods require a determination by an IO.[37] The IRPA does not contemplate that refugee claimants acquire temporary resident status; refugee claims are not handled by IOs.[38] While temporary residents, permanent residents, and refugees are able to remain in Canada for a specific period, refugee claimants are subject to a conditional removal order until their claim is heard and a determination is made.[39]\n[76] It is true that there is no singularly identifiable definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d in the IRPA or an explicitly exhaustive list of methods to receive or achieve temporary resident status. This likely relates to the total absence of refugee claimant designation status from the IRPA.\n[77] The Court finds consistency in the legislative approach. Refugee claimants pursue an entirely different process for a status which is not determined by IOs. The IRPA\u2019s notation on relevant documents that refugee claimants do not receive temporary resident status through work and student permits also supports this conclusion. This is consistent with the decision in Almadhoun when expressed as follows:\n[18] \u2026 The IRPA provides a process for the determination of temporary residency, which is not an open and flexible category. In the appellant\u2019s submission however, she met the conditions required to be considered as a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d as a result of having been issued a Refugee Protection Claimant Document.\n[19] The problem with this argument is that the IRPA temporary resident regime explicitly requires the conferral of temporary residency by an immigration officer. \u2026\n[21] \u2026 there is no such thing as a de facto temporary resident status. \u2026 [40]\n[78] Lastly, the ITA does not reference a temporary resident \u201cas defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\u201d but rather a temporary resident \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\u201d In turn, this legislatively directs that the meaning is discernible in the legislation.\n[79] As a result, the Court finds that the plain and ordinary interpretation of the text of the ITA is that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d status is found within the IRPA. Although the IRPA does not explicitly define temporary resident, it is clear from a plain reading that an individual can only become a temporary resident when an IO confers that status according to the legislation. Since the legislation does not provide for IOs or others to confer temporary resident status on refugee claimants, refugee claimants are not temporary residents within the meaning of the IRPA.\n3. Context and Purpose [80] Given the distinction between the domestic legislative history and the treaty obligation under the CRC, each will be analyzed separately.\nLegislative History [81] The Appellants claim that various government documents and speeches show that the CCB was created with the intention to help families, especially those of low income, with the cost of raising their children. This is uncontroverted. Further, the Appellants argue that Parliament did not intend to exclude refugee claimants. Rather, Parliament intended to include everyone who is legally entitled to stay in Canada. Refugee claimants are legally entitled to stay in Canada.[41]\n[82] The Respondent argues that Parliament intended to leave out refugee claimants from the CCB program. Refugees, per se, were not initially included in the legislation, but amendments incrementally included refugees and other people in \u201crefugee-like\u201d situations.[42] However, refugee claimants were never included. Parliament had ample time to include refugee claimants if it so desired and it did not.[43]\n[83] Parliament\u2019s intention is likely revealed by its approach. The legislative history shows a general goal of helping parents with the cost of raising their children and alleviating child poverty. It is clear that Parliament intentionally amended eligibility for the CCB to include certain of those with varying immigration status. There is no mention of refugee claimants, despite the eligibility being specifically extended to refugees (post immigration assessment). It is possible that this was an oversight but, on balance, it is more likely that refugee claimants were intentionally excluded. The text of the provision further supports this. If the inclusion of refugee claimants was intended, it would have been more simple to state that an \u201celigible individual\u201d is anyone who otherwise qualifies and is legally domiciled or \u201centitled to stay\u201d in Canada, rather than to use the chosen, but more exclusive, and perhaps more cumbersome categories of individuals listed in subparagraphs (e)(i) to (e)(v) of s. 122.6.\nInternational obligation and the CRC [84] The Appellants cite the 1992 budget speech, which explicitly linked the CCB to the CRC.[44] They argue that legislation is presumed to comply with Canada\u2019s international obligations. As a result, the Intervenor also stressed that the CRC creates an obligation for Canada to ensure that children have access to social security and social insurance sufficient to meet their developmental needs. Each child, regardless of their own nationality or the nationality of their parents, should be granted these rights.[45]\n[85] The Respondent claims that international obligations cannot override clear statutory language.[46]\n[86] There is a presumption that legislation conforms to international law. This means that \u201ccourts will strive to avoid construction of domestic law pursuant to which the state would be in violation of its international obligations, unless the wording of the statute clearly compels that result.\u201d[47]\n[87] Canada has committed to protecting all children, including children of refugee claimants, by signing the CRC. However, there is little ambiguity upon which one can conclude that Parliament inadvertently misaligned its specific legislative enactment with its treaty obligations. The wording of the statute clearly compels the result that refugee claimants are excluded from the CCB because the legislation does not define them as persons entitled to unconditionally remain in Canada.\ne) Conclusion to Part A [88] There are no new legal issues raised. There has been no significant development in the law that was not otherwise previously before the FCA; Almadhoun is binding precedent on this Court. Even if Almadhoun is not binding, the constructive definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not ambiguous. Refugee claimants are not and were not intended to be temporary residents \u201cwithin the meaning of\u201d the IRPA.\n[89] The legislative history points to an overall goal of alleviating child poverty and assisting parents to pay for necessities. However, Parliament may set specific eligibility criteria for the CCB, including those grounded in degree, length and certainty of residency. Such foundational logic embeds common sense at its root. Even those unfamiliar with the text, context, and purpose of the legislation grasp why it is logically so. The wording of the paragraph and the multitude of amendments to the eligibility criteria suggest that Parliament was quite deliberate; it did not intend to allow anyone without a defined legal status and established nexus to Canada to receive the CCB, regardless of its obligations under the CRC.\nIV. PART B \u2013 THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE A. Sections 1 and 15 of the Charter Have the Charter rights of Ms. Yao or Ms. Zhang under s. 7 or subsection 15(1) been violated and, if such a violation has occurred, is such a violation not justified under s. 1 of the Charter?\n[90] The excerpts from the Charter are relatively short; they are, however, ladened with nuance and covered by extensive legal interpretation.\n[91] Section 7 of the Charter provides:\n7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[92] Section 15 of the Charter provides:\n15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\nPreliminary Issue re: Notice of Constitutional Question\n[93] During the portion of the hearing in October 2022, an issue arose among counsel and was raised with the Court. It concerned the sufficiency of the original notice of constitutional question sent to the provincial Attorneys-General. Specifically, the original notice referenced whether the \u201cimmigration status\u201d as an eligibility requirement in the ITA violated the section 7 and 15 rights of the Appellants and their children. Counsel noted that submissions and argument up to that point had narrowed the status further to that of \u201crefugee claimant status\u201d.\n[94] In order to alert the provincial Attorneys-General, a clarification letter was sent to each describing the more refined status, a summary of where the appeals stood and an invitation to each Minister of the Crown to advise the Court and counsel should any now wish to make submissions concerning the sub-category of immigration status: refugee claimant. None accepted the offer.\nB. Summary of Expert Evidence [95] The background and certified area of expertise for each expert who testified before the Court are as follows:\nFor the Appellants:\nExpert Witness\nEducation and\/or Background\nCertified Area of Expertise\nMr. John Stapleton\nBA and MA in Sociology\nExpert in the historical context and development of federal and provincial income security benefits for children and families with children in Canada\nDr. Grace-Edward Galabuzi\nMA and PhD in Political Science\nExpert in race and gender-based income inequality and public administration in poverty reduction\nDr. Luin Goldring\nMS and PhD in Sociology\nExpert in the subject of the sociological experience of newcomers to Canada, in particular those with precarious legal status\nDr. Leslie Roos\nPhD in Psychology\nExpert on the psychological effects of poverty and stress on children\u2019s mental, neurological and endocrine health and development\nFor the Respondent:\nExpert Witness\nEducation and\/or Background\nCertified Area of Expertise\nDr. Andrew Sharpe\nFounder of the Centre for the Study of Living Standards\nExpert in economics and economic statistics.\n[96] Clear from all expert testimony was that each expert for the Appellants felt strongly that the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB was, at the very least, a regrettable oversight, whether advertent or inadvertent. To that extent, they were biased. In today\u2019s political and media-dominated climate, perhaps only within a court\u2019s sterile environment, if even then, can those involved in social benefits policy not have a telegraphed viewpoint. In any event, this was identified for and by the Court several times. It is not a question of forgetting or ignoring any such bias, but properly characterizing it: a strong preference for policy change in their field. Consequentially, calibrating the weight of the reports, and not excluding the witnesses, was the chosen path of the Court.\n[97] From the evidence, no expert witness was immune to having used partial, dated or parsed data. More specific references are made subsequently throughout these reasons. Repeated and recurring comments, views and opinions marched along with observations regarding the CCB, immigration to Canada and the refugee and claimant process. To be specific, the Appellants\u2019 experts made such statements. For example, Dr. Galabuzi used outdated census data; cut and pasted a previous affidavit; and selected more general groups where more specific sub-category data were available. Dr. Goldring rarely referred to refugee claimants; understated available government programs; and failed to analyze data contrasting groups by sex.\n[98] Dr. Roos used US-based research without clarifying that source in her evidence; was incorrect about access of refugee claimants to healthcare, generally; and utilized outdated data. Mr. Stapleton\u2019s testimony as a \u201csocial benefit designer\u201d was anecdotal; untied to the underlying legislation; and provided evidence on economics, an area in which he was not qualified.\n[99] The Respondent\u2019s expert witness also unintentionally salted the numbers; Dr. Sharpe cut and pasted excerpts from other reports, and he asked and answered questions not otherwise posed.\n[100] Despite these lapses of reliability, from such expert testimony, the following were the balanced, weighted and proportional conclusions extracted by the Court:\n(a)the qualifications for the CCB and the previous iterations of the benefit have consistently included both a prerequisite durational and connective tenure;\n(b)refugee claimants are desperately and markedly poor when they enter Canada;\n(c)there is an income gap between immigrants and longstanding residents in Canada; however, the income gap closes after entry and narrows as time spent living and working in Canada by immigrants passes;\n(d)the majority of refugee claimants and immigrants in Canada are from the Global South and are racialized persons or visible minorities;[48]\n(e)there are no precise data on refugee claimants per se, and so proxies of those with precarious legal status were used to infer conclusions which it was advanced such unavailable data might otherwise reveal;\n(f)there are multiple benefit programs for refugee claimants in Canada from all levels of government; these programs are sometimes duplicative and work at cross-purposes;\n(g)poverty impacts children negatively in social, developmental and ultimate outcomes;\n(h)direct cash transfer benefits, such as the CCB, help parents and children because they constitute a consistent or predictable financial support;\n(i)refugees who are women have measurably lower income levels than others, including male refugees; and,\n(j)women refugee claimants are enumerated as parents more frequently than male refugee claimants.\n[101] None of these conclusions are particularly surprising. Many such conclusions, if they had not been adduced in testimony, could simply be logically and knowingly observed through judicial notice. While overall the quality of expert testimony was less than stellar and not infrequently unrealiable, collectively, the factual summary drawn above provided the basis for conducting the Charter analysis.\nC. Section 7 [102] Section 7 protects fundamental personal rights of survival and existence: life, liberty and security of the person. The rights broadly protect against state or quasi-state action, or arguably controllable omission, which depraves the subject of those three rights, except where deprivation of the established right aligns with fundamental justice.\n[103] The Appellants argue that paragraph 122.6(e), which operates to exclude the Appellants from the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d and thus disentitles them from the CCB, deprives them and their minor children of their right to security of the person in a way that is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[49] The Appellants do not argue that their rights to life or liberty have been deprived.\n[104] The Respondent claims that the Appellants and their children are not deprived of their right to security of the person under s. 7 and that even if a deprivation of the Appellants\u2019 and their children\u2019s s. 7 rights is established, this was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[50]\n[105] To establish that there was a violation of s. 7, the Appellants must first establish that their interest falls within the ambit of s. 7. If it does, the Appellants then must show that the impugned law interferes with, or deprives them of, their life, liberty, or security of the person and that the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[51]\n[106] Accordingly, there are three elements to resolve in this part: (i) whether the legislation affects an interest protected by the right to security of the person within the meaning of s. 7; (ii) whether excluding refugee claimants from the CCB constitutes a deprivation of that right by the state; and (iii) if the first two elements are established, whether this deprivation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\na) Does the legislation affect an interest protected by the right to security of the person? [107] The first step is to determine whether the right contended for \u2013in this case, refugee claimants\u2019 right to the CCB\u2013 garners. 7 protection.[52] This requires consideration of the content of the right to security of the person and the nature of the interests protected by s. 7.[53]\n1. Is the administration of justice implicated? [108] In Gosselin, Chief Justice McLachlin explained that the jurisprudence up to that time suggested that only certain kinds of deprivation of life, liberty and security of the person are protected by s. 7: those attributable to state action implicating the administration of justice.[54] The \u201cadministration of justice\u201d phrase refers to \u201cthe state\u2019s conduct in the course of enforcing and securing compliance with the law\u201d.[55]\n[109] The administration of justice can be implicated in a variety of circumstances: criminal processes, human rights processes, parental rights in relation to state-imposed medical treatment, parental rights in the custody process, and liberty to refuse state-imposed addiction treatment.[56]\n[110] The administration of justice is not patently or readily implicated in these appeals. The Chief Justice also held that it was not implicated in Gosselin. The issue in Gosselin was whether the right to security of the person included a particular level of governmental social assistance to meet basic needs. That is similar to the question in these appeals.\n[111] However, the Chief Justice disagreed that s. 7 protection must always be narrowly confined to state action implicating the administration of justice. She suggested that s. 7 could possibly apply to rights or interests wholly unconnected to the administration of justice. Accordingly, the extent to which and the situation where s. 7 applies outside the context of the administration of justice remains unsettled, or more precisely, until this time unattained.[57]\n[112] Further, the Chief Justice said that it was not necessary to provide an exhaustive definition of the administration of justice in Gosselin by stating that \u201c[t]he issue here is not whether the administration of justice is implicated \u2014 plainly it is not \u2014 but whether the Court ought to apply s. 7 despite this fact.\u201d[58]\n[113] Similarly, the issue in these appeals is whether the Court ought to apply s. 7 despite the fact that the administration of justice is not implicated. Uncertainty arises in this respect because the Appellants effectively ask this Court to impose a positive obligation on the state to provide a social benefit. Whether the Charter protects economic rights, or more specifically whether s. 7 protects a basic minimum of social assistance, has been the subject of considerable debate, and is described by proponents and legislative bodies as the \u201csocial charter\u201d.[59]\n2. Can s. 7 protection place a positive obligation on the state? [114] The Appellants say that they do not seek that a positive obligation be recognized pursuant to s. 7. However, the argument does just that; imposing a positive obligation is imposed on the state to provide a benefit. If exclusion from the CCB scheme is a deprivation, the right to be included is the implicit right that was denied. That is, if omission deprives an individual from a right, then inclusion confers it. As a result, the Appellants request that the Court should recognize presently that s. 7 can place positive obligations on the state; the Supreme Court has left the door open, and a fulsome evidentiary record is at the threshold in these appeals.\n[115] Gosselin, did not resolve whether s. 7 could be read to encompass economic rights. However, the Chief Justice commented that even if s. 7 could be read to protect economic rights, s. 7 has been interpreted as a restriction of the state\u2019s ability to deprive people of rights, not the placement of a positive obligation on the state.[60] However, the Chief Justice left the door open for a positive obligation of the state to sustain security of the person informed by special circumstances in the future.[61]\n[116] The Appellants argue that Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)[62] is an example of a case where the Supreme Court effectively mandated a positive right.[63] The Supreme Court unanimously found that a Quebec law prohibiting insurance for private medical care deprived the claimants of their security of the person. The Court found that although the Charter does not provide a freestanding right to healthcare, where the government puts a healthcare scheme in place, the scheme must comply with the Charter.[64] The Appellants argue that this was akin to a positive benefit and analogous to the case at bar: the government put in place a scheme designed to provide benefits intended to alleviate child poverty, and the scheme must comply with the Charter by not withholding these benefits from the Appellants in violation of the s. 7 or analogous rights.[65]\n[117] The Appellants\u2019 argument is flawed because the situations are not analogous. In Chaoulli, the government imposed an exclusive healthcare scheme on all citizens of the province, which caused delays in healthcare treatment, resulting in adverse physical and psychological consequences. Finding this law unconstitutional did not place a positive obligation on Quebec to legislate for adequate healthcare; it removed a law that curtailed citizens\u2019 access to adequate healthcare. On the contrary, in this case, the government put in place a law providing a benefit to certain people in Canada. The question is whether the government should be forced to extend that benefit to refugee claimants. This is a positive obligation to which the reasoning in Chaoulli does not apply.\n[118] Although s. 7 has not been interpreted to place a positive obligation on the state in the past, the Supreme Court conceives of such an interpretation in the future given that the \u201cliving tree\u201d doctrine is a part of Canada\u2019s constitutional landscape.[66] Therefore, this issue does not does not hinge on whether s. 7 can be interpreted to impose a positive right on the state to ensure security of the person, but on whether the novel application of s. 7 should be interpreted in such a way given the circumstances of this case.\n3. Does s. 7 place a positive obligation on the state in this case? [119] The appellant in Gosselin argued that a social assistance regime which set the base amount of welfare payable to persons under the age of 30 lower than the amount payable to those 30 years of age and over violated s. 7 of the Charter.[67] The appellant asked the Supreme Court to require Quebec to remove the age-based distinction so that those 30 years of age and older would receive the same amount as those under 30. The majority found that the factual record in Gosselin was insufficient to support the proposed interpretation of s. 7.[68] The trial judge did not find the appellant\u2019s statistical and expert evidence convincing, and there was a lack of other important evidence.[69] Further, the record contained no indication that the appellant could be considered representative of the class.[70] As a result, the factual record could not \u201csupport the weight of a positive state obligation of citizen support.\u201d[71]\n[120] The Appellants argue that the relevant evidence from the Appellants and experts demonstrates that denying access to the CCB prevented the Appellants from meeting their basic needs.[72] Dr. Sharpe, in particular, confirmed that during their first few years in Canada, refugee claimants are, on average, desperately poor (women in particular).[73] This Court does not disagree that the Appellants had difficulty meeting their basic needs upon arriving in Canada and that they experienced financial hardship while awaiting refugee status, but this alone does not warrant the application of a novel interpretation of s. 7. For it to be possible for s. 7 to be applied in this way, the Appellants ought to have provided convincing statistical and expert evidence showing that their hardship warrants a positive obligation on the state to provide refugee claimants with childcare benefits.\n[121] Ultimately, s. 7 does not impose a positive obligation on the state concerning security of the person based upon individual economic need where generally a program otherwise creates broad economic benefits without violating the principles of fundamental justice. The evidence must be grounded in deprivation of the guaranteed right, not upon imputed economic amelioration based upon a sooner qualification to increased payments. These temporary, or at least finite, hardships of the Appellants and their children fail to meet the threshold set by the Supreme Court as a violation of the guaranteed right to security of the person. While this ends the s. 7 analysis, the Court pursues the balance for completeness.\n[122] The economic hardship of refugee claimants is lamentable and demonstrable. Their needs are great, but a guarantee to a certain benefit ought not to be a judicially created economic benefit masquerading as a constitutional right to security of the person. Properly assigned, it is the elected representatives within Parliament who should change and enhance the economic benefit if they deem fit, within their constitutionally assigned role as managers and payors of the public purse. Judicially created economic benefits under the ITA derogate from the democratic political process embedded through taxation by elected representation and its emblematic participation by citizens.\n4. Conclusion [123] The financial benefit of the CCB is not a deprived right. The non\u2011qualification for the CCB is not linked to the right to security of the person; the state is not legislating to deny or curtail an existing right. The scheme relates to taxation and benefits; the CCB falls within an economic calculation extracted from the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return form promulgated under the ITA. That is the very legal reason that it is before this Court.\n[124] Concerning distribution and redistribution of economic benefits, Parliament, if not given deference in such areas, shall be constrained and fettered by an ever-expanding judicially determined and coined economic \u201ccharter\u201d which applies where \u201csecurity of the person\u201d becomes a key to such a guaranteed \u201cread-in\u201d positive economic emolument despite Parliament\u2019s determination that it not be so. This would convert an economic need to a constitutional right, based upon judicially determined subjective need, anxiety and stress.\n[125] The Appellants provided insufficient evidence to prove, on balance, that the hardship experienced by refugee claimants upon entry to Canada is severe enough to warrant a novel interpretation of s. 7. As a result, the legislation does not affect an interest protected by the right to security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter.\nb) Does the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB deprive the Appellants of their right to security of the person? [126] Security of the person is engaged by \u201cstate interference with an individual\u2019s physical or psychological integrity, including any state action that causes physical or serious psychological suffering\u201d.[74] It provides for personal autonomy involving control over one\u2019s bodily integrity free from state interference.[75] The issue at this stage is whether the exclusion of refugee claimants from the definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d deprives refugee claimants of their security of the person.\n[127] The Appellants argue that by denying their eligibility to the CCB, the state deprived them and their minor children of a benefit necessary for human life and survival, which in turn deprives them of their security of the person. The Appellants\u2019 argument centres on the evidence, claiming that it reveals that access to the CCB improved the lives of the Appellants and their children, and that denial of access to the CCB caused both physical and psychological harm. The Appellants argue that there is a sufficient causal connection between the deprivation of the CCB and the poverty experienced by the Appellants because the Supreme Court has mandated a broad approach to causation under s. 7.\n[128] The Respondent argues that the Appellants have not been deprived of their security of the person because the state has not interfered with the Appellants\u2019 physical or psychological integrity.[76] Any physical and psychological hardship experienced by the Appellants arose mainly from their difficult financial situations that began before they applied for and received the CCB.[77] For a deprivation to be made out under s. 7, there must be a \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d between the harm experienced and the impugned law, of which there is none in this case. The Appellants\u2019 poverty existed before and independently of their eligibility for the benefit.[78]\n1. Is the psychological harm serious and profound? [129] The right to security of the person protects the physical and psychological integrity of the individual.[79] This right does not protect an individual from the ordinary stresses and anxieties that a person of reasonable sensibility would suffer from government action.[80] To establish an infringement of security of the person, the claimant must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the state conduct in issue:\n\u2026 [had] a serious and profound effect on a person\u2019s psychological integrity. The effects of the state interference must be assessed objectively, with a view to their impact on the psychological integrity of a person of reasonable sensibility. This need not rise to the level of nervous shock or psychiatric illness, but must be greater than ordinary stress or anxiety.[81]\n[130] The Appellants argue that they and their minor children were deprived of their security of the person by denial of the CCB, a benefit necessary for human life and survival.[82] Receiving the CCB and then losing it affords analysis of both situations: the period while they received the benefit and the period after they lost it. The CCB was the difference not between life and death, but between grinding poverty and a more stable standard of living: security of the person.[83]\n[131] Ms. Zhang testified that the receipt of the CCB alleviated her poverty and allowed her to purchase essentials. She also described the effects of no longer receiving the CCB, including the effects on her and her children\u2019s mental health.[84] Ms. Yao testified to the effect of having and then losing access to the CCB.[85] Both Appellants testified that in addition to allowing them to provide the necessities of life, the CCB enabled them to provide their children with enhanced opportunities. It is not unreasonable that these additional activities could improve child development in the long term.[86]\n[132] A factual witness on the plight of refugee claimants testified. Mr. Meagher testified to the deep levels of poverty faced by refugee claimants with whom he works. [87] He described how many refugee claimants rely on social assistance to survive. He also explained that ineligibility for the CCB pushes refugee claimants into deeper levels of poverty.[88]\n[133] Depriving the Appellants\u2019 minor children of the CCB exposes them to the negative effects of poverty to the fullest degree, which could be mitigated or eliminated by access to the CCB.[89] The withholding of the CCB contributes to the significant and potentially permanent negative effects of poverty. Dr. Roos testified to the effect that poverty has on children. Direct cash transfers, such as the CCB, can improve child well-being.[90]\n[134] Despite the findings above, being excluded from the CCB does not rise to the necessary threshold. Without the CCB, the Appellants were able to secure the means necessary for human life and survival in a multitude of ways.[91] Any impact resulting from the Appellants\u2019 poverty was not permanent and was mitigated by their eventual eligibility for the CCB.[92]\n[135] In Scheuneman,[93] the Federal Court determined that the suspension of Canada Pension Plan disability benefits, which served as partial income replacement, did not cause psychological stress at a level that would breach s. 7.[94] The Supreme Court explained the following regarding this issue in G(J):\n\u2026 It is clear that the right to security of the person does not protect the individual from the ordinary stresses and anxieties that a person of reasonable sensibility would suffer as a result of government action. If the right were interpreted with such broad sweep, countless government initiatives could be challenged on the ground that they infringe the right to security of the person, massively expanding the scope of judicial review, and, in the process, trivializing what it means for a right to be constitutionally protected. \u2026[95]\n[136] While the mental health of the Appellants and their children was impacted, this does not constitute a \u201cserious and profound effect\u201d as described within G(J) and pertaining to s. 7. Ordinary stress and anxiety are not sufficient, including, even when government action causes those present, ordinary stresses and anxieties.\n2. Is there sufficient casual connection? [137] The Appellants must not only prove that they experienced serious psychological harm, but also that it resulted from the conduct of the state.[96] In other words, there must be a causal link between the impugned state conduct and the Charter violation claimed. This connection can be established by a reasonable inference on a balance of probabilities, and does not require that the impugned law be the only or dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant.[97] A causal connection exists where the state action is a foreseeable and necessary cause of the prejudice, but this is not the only way to establish causation.[98] The burden of establishing this connection is on the Appellants. The Supreme Court in Bedford cautioned that although mere speculation is not sufficient, setting the bar too high would risk barring meritorious claims.[99]\n[138] If the Appellants have been deprived of their security of the person, is there a sufficient causal connection between the deprivation and the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d? It is clear that the CCB eligibility requirements are not the only or primary cause of the Appellants\u2019 poverty. However, it is not necessary to determine if the requirements are the dominant cause.\n[139] The Supreme Court has mandated a broad approach to causation under s. 7 and to the test of whether the \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d standard has been met. The evidence demonstrates that the Appellants\u2019 security of the person was enhanced while receiving the CCB, and deprived once they lost access to the CCB.[100] Potentially, the Appellants have moved beyond \u201cmere speculation.\u201d Receipt of the CCB improved their situations, and they suffered without it. A reasonable inference could be drawn that a sufficient causal connection exists between the requirements and the Appellants\u2019 poverty. The bar must not be set too high.\n[140] Other factors are at play: is ineligibility for the CCB a cause of the Appellants\u2019 poverty, if only a meaningful partial cause? If so, arguably, poverty in Canada is at least partially perpetuated or sustained by the state; poverty could be alleviated if the government provided \u201csufficient\u201d financial assistance. Equally, Parliament chose to provide the CCB, which the Appellants would otherwise have been able to receive but for the unattained residency requirements in the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d. Overall, \u201c[a] sufficient causal connection is sensitive to the context of the particular case \u2026 .\u201d[101]\n[141] The novel finding of a positive element to s. 7 colours this context. The sufficient causal connection requirement sits differently from other cases.\n[142] Any physical or psychological hardships experienced by the Appellants were initially caused by their difficult financial or domestic situations subsisting before applying for the CCB, which were not caused, perpetuated or worsened by the Canadian state before or after entry. The Appellants\u2019 poverty existed before and independently of their ineligibility for the CCB.[102]\n[143] The world\u2019s largest totalitarian communist regime, the People\u2019s Republic of China, created the intolerable situation and justification for which the Appellants needed to flee China, and to apply for and ultimately receive full refugee status. The legislation that creates that critical beneficial environment, arguably essential to the life, liberty and\/or security of each Appellant\u2019s person, is the very piece of legislation now maligned, the IRPA. Moreover, the ITA incorporates the IRPA to employ the durational and qualitative connection necessary for the Appellants to qualify for the CCB when they become Convention refugees, and simply not before that point.\nc) Is the deprivation in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice? [144] The three central principles of fundamental justice recognized in the jurisprudence are arbitrariness, overbreadth, and gross disproportionality.[103] The analysis of these principles involves comparison with the object of the law that is challenged.[104] This analysis does not consider the law\u2019s effectiveness.[105]\n[145] The first step is to identify the object of the impugned law.[106] The object of the impugned law must be defined precisely for the purposes of s. 7; the \u201cdirect target of the measure\u201d must be identified.[107] Defining the objective too broadly would make it difficult to determine if the means used to further it are overbroad or grossly disproportionate.[108]\n[146] At this stage, competing social interests and public benefits conferred by the impugned law are not relevant. These factors should instead be considered under the s. 1 analysis.[109]\n[147] The Supreme Court described how to characterize Parliament\u2019s purpose in a s. 7 analysis regarding overbreadth in Moriarity.[110] More recently, the Court explained that:\nThe most significant and reliable indicator of legislative purpose would, of course, be a statement of purpose within the subject law. Beyond that, generally, courts seeking to identify legislative purpose look to the text, context, and scheme of the legislation and extrinsic evidence, which can (subject to the caution we offer below) include Hansard, legislative history, government publications and the evolution of the impugned provisions \u2026 .[111]\n1. Arbitrariness [148] A law is arbitrary where there is no rational connection between its object and the limit that it imposes on life, liberty or security of the person. An arbitrary law is not capable of fulfilling its objectives.[112]\n2. Overbreadth [149] A law is overbroad where it is arbitrary in part; it is \u201cso broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose.\u201d In this situation, there is no rational connection between the purpose of the law and some, but not all, of its impacts.[113] The law may be rational in some cases, while overreaching in its effect in others. However, \u201c[d]espite this recognition of the scope of the law as a whole, the focus remains on the individual and whether the effect on the individual is rationally connected to the law\u2019s purpose.\u201d[114]\n3. Gross disproportionality [150] The gross disproportionality inquiry compares the law\u2019s purpose with its negative effects on the rights of the claimant in order to determine if the impact is \u201ccompletely out of sync with the object of the law\u201d.[115] The standard for gross disproportionality is high.[116]\n[151] Further, the number of people who experience grossly disproportionate effects is not relevant; \u201ca grossly disproportionate effect on one person is sufficient to violate the norm.\u201d[117]\n[152] Arbitrariness and overbreadth are the two principles of fundamental justice present before the Court is these appeals. These issues turn on the purpose of the eligibility requirements.\n[153] The Appellants argue that the purpose of the requirements ensures that those in receipt of the CCB have meaningful, but not necessarily permanent, connections to Canada. In that case, it may be arbitrary to exclude refugee claimants who have resided in Canada for at least 18 months, and who may have formed many meaningful connections to Canada during that time, including bearing children who are legally Canadians by birth on Canadian soil.\n[154] On the other hand, the purpose of the requirements is to exclude anyone whose legal attachment to Canada is uncertain. Fairly put, the stay of a refugee claimant in Canada is transient and uncertain in the sense that a claim may be rejected at any point and the claimant is de jure subject to a conditional removal order which compels the person to leave the country upon notice, regardless of the connections that this person has formed in the meantime.\n[155] The Appellants assert that Vriend[118] stands for the proposition that the measureable durational purpose of the legislative regime should be considered and preferred. However, this is contrary to the jurisprudence that explains that it is the \u201cdirect target\u201d of the impugned measure that is relevant at this stage of the analysis. The impugned measure is the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d in paragraph 122.6(e) of the ITA, not the CCB regime as a whole.\n[156] Vriend was decided under s. 15, not s. 7. At the cited paragraph, Justice Iacobucci was undertaking a s. 1 analysis. That being said, a s. 1 analysis requires a rational connection, similar to a s. 7 arbitrariness analysis. However, Justice Iacobucci was trying to discern the objective of the omission, not whether there was a rational connection.\n[157] It is also difficult to rely on Justice Iacobucci\u2019s analysis as analogous because the government in Vriend did not provide any object for the omission: it argued that only the overall goal of the legislation needed to be examined. Therefore, the state failed the s. 1 analysis for want of pressing and substantial objective.[119] Justice Iacobucci did continue the analysis and found that there was no rational connection, but that was only assuming \u201csolely for the sake of the analysis, that the [government] correctly argued that where the objective of the whole of the legislation is pressing and substantial, this is sufficient to satisfy the first stage of the inquiry under s. 1 of the Charter.\u201d[120]\n[158] The Court accepts that the purpose of the requirements is to exclude those without the requisite legal attachment to Canada from the CCB. It can be argued that the requirements appear overbroad in that they may prevent children who are Canadian citizens, and whose strong connections to Canada are clear, from benefiting from the CCB. However, this is also true of such Canadian children awaiting the otherwise unchallenged 18-month period.\n[159] Ultimately, the Court is left with a view that the more refined and precise rationale of the impunged section and the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d is hybrid in nature.\n[160] This two-pronged feature appeared from all legislative expert witnesses who referenced the tension in the evolved definition between longstanding and meaningful presence versus temporary and more permanent legal rights to stay. In conclusion, duration and certainty of tenure march hand in hand as twin objects.\nd) Section 7 Summary [161] Ultimately, Parliament created the CCB and its predecessor programs as an economic benefit to foster and assist the long-term health and development of children resident in Canada during parental rearing. The implication of the administration of justice is not proximate to that right. The Supreme Court has yet to settle the extent to which s. 7 applies outside the context of the administration of justice. The CCB is not a constitutional right; it is not justiciable.\n[162] For the CCB, the heart of this duality embraces two concepts for qualification: a durational measure of 18 months and a qualitative measure of residential certainty, namely, achievement of temporary resident status or greater. These two thresholds qualify one for the economic right, the CCB.\n[163] The CCB is first and foremost a negative assessment under the ITA; refundable benefits and credits created by the ITA are negative taxes. The FCA has spoken on this: an assessment, and by deduction a negative assessment, under the ITA cannot deprive the subject of security of the person.[121]\n[164] The objectives of the IRPA, in combination with the ITA, are rationally connected to the durational and qualitative thresholds required to create a suitable CCB regime; from its genesis, the CCB has used both duration of residency and degree of attachment to Canada in tandem, with legislative emphasis ebbing and flowing, as conjunctive measures or proxies. Preferring one over, or without, the other to achieve broader or sooner economic benefits is motivational reasoning.\n[165] A s. 7 Charter violation has not occurred in these appeals for compelling legal and factual reasons directly related to the CCB\u2019s nature, creation and context.\nD. Section 15 of the Charter [166] In order to establish a prima facie violation of s. 15(1), the claimant must demonstrate that the impugned law: (1) on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and (2) imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage.[122] Neither step of the analysis is concerned with whether the challenged law created the social, political, or legal disadvantage of protected groups.[123]\n[167] The two steps of the test should be kept distinct where possible, but in adverse effects cases, there is potential for overlap. As explained by the Supreme Court in Fraser, \u201c[w]hat matters in the end is that a court asks and answers the necessary questions relevant to the s. 15(1) inquiry, not whether it keeps the two steps of the inquiry in two impermeable silos.\u201d[124] More recently, the Supreme Court stated in Sharma that while the two steps are not watertight compartments and that there may be overlap in the evidence relevant at each step, the two steps ask fundamentally different questions. Therefore, each step must remain distinct from the other.[125]\n[168] After the claimant proves a s. 15(1) violation, the government can justify the distinction by demonstrating that the impugned law is ameliorative, and thus constitutional, pursuant to s. 15(2).[126] However, s. 15(2) is not typically mentioned if it is not relevant.[127] This Court observes that s. 15(2) is neither relevant nor before the Court in these appeals and therefore only an analysis of s. 15(1) follows:\na) Does the impugned law, on its face or in its impact, create a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds? [169] Step one of the s. 15(1) analysis asks the Court to determine whether a law, on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based upon an enumerated or analogous ground. In the case of direct discrimination, where the law makes a distinction on its face, identifying that distinction is relatively straightforward. In the case of adverse effects discrimination, the claimant must establish that the law creates a distinction in its impact.\n[170] The enumerated grounds are found in the text of s. 15(1): race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age and mental or physical disability.\n[171] Courts, specifically the Supreme Court, have expanded the enumerated grounds by creating, or revealing (depending on one\u2019s perspective) analogous grounds. Analogous grounds are implicitly read into the section. They are based on personal characteristics that are immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity. Recognized analogous grounds include sexual orientation, marital status, and citizenship.[128] Analogous grounds may be empirically immutable, such as sexual orientation, or constructively immutable, such as religion.[129] Once an analogous ground has been recognized, \"it stands thereafter as a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination\".[130]\n[172] It is no impediment that an analogous ground is limited to a subset of the Canadian population, as embedded analogous grounds \u201cmay be necessary to permit meaningful consideration of intra-group discrimination.\u201d[131]\n[173] In these appeals, the Appellants have made two s. 15 arguments: (1) direct discrimination on the basis of refugee claimant status, which they assert should now be recognized as an analogous ground; and (2) alternatively, adverse effects discrimination on the basis of race and\/or sex, which are enumerated grounds, through their exclusion under s. 122.6 of the ITA.\n1. Does the law, on its face, create a distinction on the basis of refugee claimant status? [174] The Appellants argue that by denying refugee claimants access to the CCB, s. 122.6 creates, on its face, a direct distinction based on refugee claimant status.[132] They claim that refugee claimant status should be recognized as a new analogous ground, and that there is no case law preventing the Court from reaching this conclusion.[133]\n[175] The Appellants say that two Corbiere factors militate in favour of establishing refugee claimant status as an analogous ground: refugee claimant status is immutable, very difficult to change, or changeable only at unacceptable personal cost; and refugee claimants are lacking political power and are disadvantaged and vulnerable.[134] Corbiere also shows that embedded analogous grounds may be necessary.[135]\n[176] According to the Appellants, refugee claimant status is functionally immutable because refugee claimants cannot change their status on their own unless they abandon their claim, which is an unacceptable personal cost.[136] Factually, refugee claims may take many years.[137]\n[177] Further, the Appellants argue that refugee claimant status is not a choice, which distinguishes their case from the Toussaint[138] decision. Choice was at the heart of the Toussaint analysis, where the FCA held that immigration status is not an analogous ground. Additionally, it is argued that the Toussaint case does not apply to refugee claimants because refugee claimants are not in Canada illegally, as the appellant was in Toussaint.[139]\n[178] The Appellants also argue that refugee claimants are disadvantaged in numerous ways and are vulnerable to having their interests overlooked. Refugee claimant status parallels citizenship as a ground of differential treatment. In Andrews,[140] the Supreme Court explained that relative to citizens, non-citizens are a group lacking in political power and are vulnerable to having their interests overlooked.[141] Refugee claimants: are more likely than others to experience deep poverty; may face limited, arbitrary, or no access to necessary benefits and services; and, are vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.[142] Further, they are disproportionately racialized and experience significant disadvantages based on race.\n[179] The Appellants recognize that a number of cases have concluded that immigration status is not an analogous ground, but they maintain that refugee claimant status is different. Almadhoun was decided without the benefit of Fraser, and comments in that case about s. 15 are obiter dicta.[143] Immigration status, in the abstract, includes people in a wide variety of circumstances. The Appellants must be considered in their unique, distinct circumstances.[144]\n[180] The Respondent relies on Toussaint, Irshad[145], and Li[146] for the proposition that immigration status is not an analogous ground. While the FCA did not specifically deal with refugee claimants in those decisions, this is not fatal because:\ni. in obiter, the FCA in Almadhoun saw no reason to reconsider immigration status in the particular context of refugee claimants;\nii. in Doctors for Care,[147] the Federal Court held that it was bound by decisions rejecting immigration status as an analogous ground to refugee claimants because immigration status includes refugee claimant; and\niii. in Kanyinda c Quebec (P-G),[148] the Superior Court of Quebec held that being a refugee claimant was not an immutable characteristic because being a refugee claimant is temporary.[149]\n[181] The Respondent further argues that even if immigration status does not cover refugee claimants, refugee claimant status is still not an analogous ground because being a refugee claimant is not an immutable characteristic.[150] Refugee claimant status can and does change, both because of a government decision or a personal choice.[151]\nAnalysis\n[182] When considering the identification of a new analogous ground, the main focus should be on whether the characteristic is immutable or constructively immutable. The Appellants claim that in Corbiere, the Supreme Court established four factors that inform whether a particular characteristic is an analogous ground: (1) whether the characteristic is fundamental; (2) whether the characteristic is immutable; (3) whether those with the characteristic are lacking in political power, disadvantaged, or vulnerable to having their interests overlooked; and (4) whether the characteristic is included in federal and provincial human rights codes.[152] However, these four factors come from the minority opinion, written by Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9.\n[183] Justice McLachlin, as she then was, and Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, explained:\n\u2026 It seems to us that what [the enumerated ] grounds have in common is the fact that they often serve as the basis for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit but on the basis of a personal characteristic that is immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity. This suggests that the thrust of identification of analogous grounds \u2026 is to reveal grounds based on characteristics that we cannot change or that the government has no legitimate interest in expecting us to change to receive equal treatment under the law. To put it another way, s. 15 targets the denial of equal treatment on grounds that are actually immutable, like race, or constructively immutable, like religion. Other factors identified in the cases as associated with the enumerated and analogous grounds, like the fact that the decision adversely impacts on a discrete and insular minority or a group that has been historically discriminated against, may be seen to flow from the central concept of immutable or constructively immutable personal characteristics, which too often have served as illegitimate and demeaning proxies for merit-based decision making.[153]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[184] The Court is bound by the FCA\u2019s decision in Toussaint that immigration status is not an analogous ground. The same conclusion was reached by that Court earlier in Forrest,[154] which was later overruled in Tan,[155] but not on the issue of the absence of immutability.[156] Refugee claimant status is conceptually a subset of immigration status. Immigration status refers to whether a person is a non-immigrant, an immigrant, or a non-permanent resident. Refugee claimants are non-permanent residents while they await an IRB decision.\n[185] Under the IRPA, Parliament may treat people differently based on their immigration status (or lack thereof), so Parliament should also be able to do so in other legal regimes deploying that same definition. This is particularly true if the benefit or negative tax arises within the ITA. The Ontario Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized in Irshad[157] that where the constitutionality of Canada\u2019s immigration laws is not being challenged, a legislature may allocate social benefits based on immigration status.[158]\n[186] Even if this Court concludes that binding precedent on immigration status does not cover refugee claimants, refugee claimant status is still not an analogous ground. Admittedly, refugee claimant status is subjectively immutable such that refugee claimants cannot change it themselves (without abandoning their claim). However, by definition, refugee claimant status is entirely mutable: at some point, the claim will either be approved or denied and the individual will no longer be a refugee claimant. As a result, refugee claimant status can and does change, as it did for these very Appellants. Further, and with reference to the government having \u201cno legitimate interest in expecting us to change to receive equal treatment under the law\u201d, there are precise, detailed and prescribed governmental processes by which the very status of \u201crefugee claimant\u201d ought to and optimally will change.\n[187] Further, changing one\u2019s refugee claimant status does not come at an unacceptable cost to personal identity, as is the case with sexual identity, marital status, and citizenship. Refugee claimant status is not in itself tied to identity and refugee claimants all likely hope that their status indeed changes, ideally to that of refugee. Refugee claimants may abandon or withdraw their claims. Additionally, merely because a change in status is in the control of government agents does not make it immutable.[159] The ability to change personal characteristics is not a criterion within the test for immutability. To say that a refugee claimant has no choice but to stay in Canada is hindsight; the merits of the claim have not then been decided on that point.[160]\n[188] For these reasons, the Court concludes that the first part of the test is not achieved; refugee claimant status is not an analogous ground, and as a result, step one of the s. 15(1) test is not met.\n2. Does the law, in its impact, create a distinction on the basis of race and\/or sex? [189] The Appellants assert that because refugee claimants are predominantly racialized and women, s. 122.6 creates a distinction, in its impact, on the basis of race and sex. The provision is facially neutral or projects formal equality, but the exclusion of refugee claimants from CCB eligibility disproportionately impacts racialized people. The asserted distinction is on the basis of race, an enumerated ground.[161] Ample evidence demonstrates that refugee claimants are consistently and disproportionately visible minorities, and Dr. Sharpe explained that the country of origin is the best available indicator of refugee claimants\u2019 racialized status.[162] This is not a transitory phenomenon.[163] Implicitly, it is also the best indication of an immigrant\u2019s racialized status.\n[190] In addition to refugee claimants from Africa and Asia, claimants from the \u201cGlobal South\u201d are also likely visible minorities.[164] The Appellants assert that this case parallels the circumstances in Fraser and Flette.[165]\n[191] The Respondent argues that, considering the overall distribution of the CCB, the requirements do not have a disproportionate impact on racialized people. The Respondent further argues that racialized people are affected more by the requirements as a matter of chance.\nAnalysis\n[192] The asserted distinction is on the basis of race and sex, both enumerated grounds.[166] The CCB eligibility requirements exclude refugee claimants, and measurably more often women. Indeed, refugee claimants appear to be predominantly racialized, and race is a protected ground. Thus, the analysis need not contain a determination of an analogous ground. Instead, the analysis can move to a determination of adverse impact.\n[193] The Respondent acknowledges that racialized people face disadvantage, but systemic or historical disadvantage among racialized people is not in itself enough to show that the requirements have a discriminatory impact.[167]\n[194] In Fraser, the Supreme Court explained that in adverse effects discrimination cases, the first stage of the s. 15 test will be met if the law has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group.[168] As noted in Fraser, \u201cclaimants need not show that the criteria, characteristics or other factors used in the impugned law affect all members of a protected group in the same way.\u201d[169] Rather, adverse effects discrimination occurs \u201cwhen a seemingly neutral law has a disproportionate impact on members of groups protected on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground\u201d.[170] As the Supreme Court explained at paragraph 34:\n\u2026 the application of \u201cneutral\u201d rules may not produce equality in substance for disadvantaged groups. Membership in such groups often brings with it a unique constellation of physical, economic and social barriers. Laws which distribute benefits or burdens without accounting for those differences \u2026 are the prime targets of indirect discrimination claims. \u2026[171]\n[195] The majority in Sharma sought to bring clarity to the concept of adverse effects discrimination by discussing the standard by which courts should measure impact, and how claimants might prove impact.[172] In doing so, the Supreme Court stated that the first step of the s. 15(1) test examines whether the impugned law created or contributed to \u201ca disproportionate impact on a protected group, as compared to non-group members.\u201d[173] [emphasis in original] This involves drawing a comparison between the claimant group and other groups or the general population.[174] A \u201cmirror comparator group\u201d is no longer required as \u201c[i]t is unnecessary to pinpoint a particular group that precisely corresponds to the claimant group except for the personal characteristic or characteristics alleged to ground the discrimination.\u201d[175]\n[196] Causation is a central issue in step one.[176] The Court explained in Sharma that, at the first step, the claimant must \u201cpresent sufficient evidence to prove the impugned law, in its impact, creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on the basis of a protected ground\u201d (emphasis in original), and that causation is thus a central issue.[177] The majority in Sharma, citing Fraser, found that two types of evidence are helpful in proving causation: contextual evidence about the claimant group\u2019s situation, and evidence about the result of the law in practice.[178] While ideally a claimant would provide evidence of both, the evidentiary burden should not be unduly difficult to meet.[179] The majority confirmed that no specific form of evidence is required to prove causation, but Courts should \u201ccarefully scrutinize scientific evidence\u201d and only admit it where it has a reliable foundation.[180] Causation may be proved by a reasonable inference.[181]\n[197] Considering the overall distribution of the CCB, there is insufficient evidence that the requirements have a disproportionate impact on racialized women. The question in Fraser was whether the inability of participants in the job-sharing program to acquire full-time pension credit for their service, a rule which the employer applied to all job-sharers equally, had a disproportionate impact on women. The Court concluded that impugned measures had an adverse impact on women because the majority of people in job-sharing roles were women, but this was not the case for individuals in roles with other forms of job status, who obtained full pension rights.[182] Further, the Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Flette found that the first step of the s. 15 test was met because, inter alia, while the impugned measures applied equally to all children in care, the children in care were predominantly Indigenous. Therefore, the law had a disproportionate impact on Indigenous children.\n[198] The question in this case is whether the inability of refugee claimants to receive the CCB has a disproportionate impact on racialized people, who in the context of the CCB are mostly women. It is possible that the law creates a distinction on the basis of race, since refugee claimants are predominantly racialized people. However, in order to pass the test as set out in Fraser and \u201crefined\u201d in Sharma, the distinction must have a disproportionate impact on members of the protected group. The question therefore becomes whether there is evidence that excluding refugee claimants from the CCB significantly decreases the number of racialized people collecting the CCB. There is no evidence of this before the Court. There are many other groups beyond refugee claimants who are eligible for the CCB, and these groups, such as refugees, include a disproportionate number of racialized people.\n[199] Qualifying refugee claimants for the CCB might increase the absolute number of racialized people and women collecting the benefit (as it would be the absolute number per se), but no evidence suggests that it would measurably increase the proportion of racialized people and women collecting the CCB. Hence, deductively, one cannot have disproportional adverse impact, if reversing the qualification, thereby including refugee claimants, would not increase the proportion of racialized people collecting the benefit versus the proportion when just refugees qualify. The same logic applies to women, who in any CCB-receiving group form a large, constant and uncontroverted majority.\n[200] The qualification requirements of the CCB do not have a disproportionate impact on racialized individuals who have reached refugee or temporary resident status because the requirements do not prevent a racialized person from getting the CCB in that capacity. The statistical data bear this out. Racialized people receive the CCB at a proportion equal to, or, in fact, greater than, their representation within the Canadian population.[183]\n[201] Given the finding above, stage one of the two-part test is not reached. However, the Court will complete the stage two analysis on an alternative basis.\nb) Does the impugned law impose burdens or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating disadvantage? [202] This second stage of the analysis is similar for either direct or adverse impact discrimination. The objective is to examine the impact of the harm caused to the affected group, which may include economic exclusion or disadvantage, social exclusion, psychological harms, physical harms, or political exclusion. The harm \u201cmust be viewed in light of any systemic or historical disadvantages faced by the claimant group\u201d.[184] The law will be discriminatory if it widens the gap between the historically disadvantaged group and the rest of society, rather than narrows or is indifferent to it.[185] It becomes a larger comparator than the step one analysis.\n[203] The contextual factors relevant at the second step depend on the nature of the case.[186] Though they may assist at this stage of the s. 15 test, the presence of social prejudices and stereotyping are not necessary factors.[187]\n[204] At step two of the test, the claimant need not prove that the legislature intended to discriminate; judicial notice can play a role; and courts may infer that a law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage, where the inference is supported by the evidence.[188] Courts should also consider the broader legislative context.[189]\n1. Does the law reinforce, perpetuate or exacerbate disadvantage of refugee claimants? [205] The Appellants argue that denying refugee claimants the CCB discriminates by perpetuating and exacerbating the disadvantages faced by refugee claimants.[190]\n[206] Refugee claimants are a fundamentally disadvantaged group. A distinction that denies them a benefit because they are refugee claimants, a benefit that would otherwise be available to them, deepens their disadvantage relative to other Canadians.[191]\n[207] The evidence of Dr. Goldring, Dr. Sharpe, Mr. Meagher, and the Statistics Canada data demonstrate the measurable poverty of refugee claimants.[192] Mr. Meagher\u2019s testimony illustrates the difficulty faced by refugee claimants who are parents in providing for their family\u2019s basic needs, the exact type of disadvantage that the CCB was enacted to ameliorate.[193]\n[208] The CCB can make a measurable difference in the family\u2019 lives of refugee claimants. The Appellants\u2019 evidence illustrates the disadvantage faced by refugee claimants without access to the CCB, and the positive impact of receiving the benefit.[194]\n[209] The Appellants make a strong argument that the inability of refugee claimants to receive the CCB perpetuates and exacerbates their disadvantage. There are however some countervailing arguments, which in light of the decision in Sharma have certain weight. The permanent impact and contributory effect do not rise to the threshold necessary.\n[210] The temporary, or at least finite, ineligibility for the CCB does not have the permanent effects on the Appellants\u2019 well-being that the Appellants contend that it has. This evidence comes from Dr. Goldring, Dr. Galabuzi, and Dr. Roos, all of whom are advocates and are approaching unreliability in their deeply held conclusions. Their evidence that the denial of the benefit has permanent impact is not persuasive.[195]\n[211] The deprivation of the CCB is mitigated by open work permits, employment-related benefits, various federal non-refundable tax credits, primary and secondary education for refugee claimant children at no cost, the Interim Federal Health Program, and social assistance.[196] These other benefits soften the temporary ineligibility for the CCB.[197]\n[212] The broader constitutional and legal context supports the distinction made by the requirements. The constitutional context is that immigration status has so far not been recognized as a protected ground of discrimination. The legal context is that, as stated by the Supreme Court in Chieu,[198] Parliament may treat people differently based on immigration status. If that is the case under the IRPA, Parliament should also be able to make reasonable distinctions on this basis in other legal regimes.[199]\n[213] Ineligibility for the CCB is almost always temporary for refugee claimants, although the length of such status varies. Once a claim is accepted, the \u201cnew\u201d refugee becomes a protected person and qualifies for the benefit. Similarly, CCB ineligibility is even temporary for those whose claims have been withdrawn, have been abandoned, or have failed. These individuals will either leave the country, and therefore be ineligible for other reasons, or stay in Canada through a humanitarian and compassionate application and ultimately become entitled to the CCB.[200] No one permanently stays, or is intended to stay, in the refugee claimant category.\n2. Does the law reinforce, perpetuate or exacerbate disadvantage of racialized persons and women? [214] The Appellants contend that denying refugee claimants the CCB creates a distinction in its impact on the basis of race. Section 122.6 perpetuates the substantial disadvantages faced by refugee claimant mothers, who are predominantly racialized women.[201] Racialized women suffer economic disadvantages compared to nearly every other group.[202]\n[215] For racialized women with children, economic disadvantage is self\u2011perpetuating. A certain level of financial support is necessary. For many refugee claimants, their principal source of financial support is government assistance.[203]\n[216] Denying refugee claimants the CCB also exacerbates and perpetuates the disadvantages faced by their minor children, who are racialized children living in poverty. The experience of child poverty and precarity has lasting, even lifelong impacts.[204]\n[217] In addition, by approving the Appellants\u2019 CCB claims and providing the benefit for a time and then cutting off access and demanding repayment, the government\u2019s conduct in administering s. 122.6 did even more to perpetuate disadvantage than denying the benefit based on that provision itself.[205] Mr. Meagher testified that he has seen even government workers advise refugee claimants to apply for the CCB.[206]\n[218] The Appellants cite Stoffman for the proposition that the government\u2019s conduct in enforcing s. 122.6 is a freestanding ground that must be considered. It is true that in Stoffman the Supreme Court stated:\n\u2026 It is also clear that the \u201claw\u201d in question comprehends not just Reg. 5.04 alone, but the policy which is followed in its application to those who come within its terms as well. It would be incongruous if our entitlement to equality \u201cbefore and under the law\u201d and to the \u201cequal protection and equal benefit of the law\u201d did not reach the manner in which a law was interpreted and enforced by those charged with its operation. It will often be this process of interpretation and enforcement that determines the impact that a law has on the lives of those who come within its scope. \u2026[207]\n[219] However, the context of that case was different. Stoffman concerned the admitting privileges of physicians at a hospital. The impugned regulation provided that staff would be expected to retire in the year that they reached the age of 65, but those who wished to defer retirement could make a special application to a board of trustees. The policy of the board in implementing this regulation was that all physicians were expected to retire unless they had something unique to offer to the hospital. On this basis, most of the respondent physicians did not have their admitting privileges renewed upon turning 65.\n[220] The respondents in Stoffman argued that the regulation violated the Charter either by its terms or by the manner of its application.[208] The Supreme Court found that the regulation and the policy that the board adopted as a guide to its application came within the sphere of s. 15 of the Charter.[209]\n[221] The impact of the requirements does not include the method of administration, as argued by the Appellants. This is not a free-standing ground that must be considered when determining whether s. 122.6 is constitutional. Stoffman is wrongly relied upon in this context. The administration of the ITA is not relevant in determining the constitutionality of the provisions. Further, the ITA authorizes the government to provide the CCB and then ask for it back. The Appellants have not challenged the constitutionality of any of the relevant administrative provisions of the ITA. Finally, the conduct of the Minister or the CRA is not the proper subject matter for an appeal to this Court.\n[222] The Court is not in a position to make a finding of economic disadvantage applicable to all racialized groups who are women. Not all racialized groups are in the same economic position. In Tabingo,[210] a similar conclusion was reached by the Federal Court.[211] However, according to 2006 and 2016 census data utilized by the Appellants\u2019 experts, there are particular racialized groups that do better economically than non-racialized groups, female comparators included.[212] Further, there are wide variations among racialized groups in both average employment earnings and low-income rates. Even in lower-income deciles, there are instances where particular racialized groups do better than non-racialized groups.[213] These countervailing facts stare in the Court\u2019s face.\n[223] On an alternative basis, even if the eligibility requirements make a distinction based on the enumerated ground of race, they do not deny the benefit in a way that perpetuates, reinforces, or exacerbates disadvantage.[214]\nc) Section 15 Summary [224] The Appellants\u2019 claim that the CCB eligibility requirements infringe their section 15 rights fails. First, refugee status is not an analogous category. Toussaint is binding precedent in this respect, and even if no precedent existed, refugee status would not be an analogous ground because it is not immutable. Refugee claimant status can and does change, and such change does not come at a cost to one\u2019s personal identity.\n[225] Second, exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB does not discriminate on the basis of race or sex. While a large portion of refugee claimants are racialized women, groups that presently qualify for the CCB include racialized women and those groups make up a significant portion of those eligible for the CCB. As a result, there is insufficient evidence that excluding refugee claimants from the CCB disproportionately affects racialized women receiving the benefit such that, as a whole, the CCB qualification requirements discriminate on the basis of race and\/or sex.\nE. Section 1 [226] Given that the Court need not consider it, the discussion concerning s. 1 shall be brief; the Court also cautions that it is moot. Consequently, it is observational.\n[227] Once the claimant has established an infringement of a Charter right, the burden shifts to the government to justify that infringement under s. 1 on a balance of probabilities.[215] Section 1 provides:\n1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n[228] The legal test for the application of s. 1 is known as the Oakes test. The government must establish that: (1) the law has a pressing and substantial objective; and (2) the means chosen are proportional to that object. The second step, the proportionality test, has three prongs that ask if: (i) the means adopted are rationally connected to that objective; (ii) the law is minimally impairing of the right in question; and (iii) there is proportionality between the deleterious and salutary effects of the law.[216]\n[229] In cases where s. 7 is infringed, the law may still be justified under s. 1.[217] It is difficult to justify a s. 7 violation, but there may be situations where the countervailing public good justifies depriving an individual of life, liberty, or security of the person.[218]\n[230] More importantly, the s. 1 analysis is distinct from and embarked upon once a stand-alone violation of a guarantee infringed right occurs; the test is whether that existing infringement may be justified. It is again noted that the Court\u2019s finding is that no violation has occurred in the first instance.\na) Does the law have a pressing and substantial object? [231] The object of the law must be sufficiently pressing and substantial to justify the infringement of a Charter right.[219] For a law\u2019s purpose to be pressing and substantial, that purpose \u201cmust be characterized in light of the requirements of the Oakes test to be of value\u201d. Too broad of a characterization will frustrate the purpose of the s. 1 analysis.[220]\n[232] Courts must be skeptical of using budgetary constraints to justify Charter infringements, but financial crises may provide exceptions.[221] As the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]o the extent that the objective of the law was to cut costs, that objective is suspect as a pressing and substantial objective under the authority in N.A.P.E.\u201d.[222]\n[233] The Respondent asserts that the objective of the eligibility requirements is to ensure that individuals receiving the CCB have the requisite legal attachment to Canada by excluding those whose attachment to Canada is transient or uncertain. This is a pressing and substantial objective. Canada should not be required to pay a social benefit to every person who enters the country.[223] The legislative history supports that this is the objective.[224]\n[234] Observationally, the Respondent has not meaningfully explained why ensuring CCB recipients have the requisite legal attachment to Canada is a pressing and substantial objective needed to override and justify a Charter violation, if one had occurred. Is it because expanding the scope of the benefit would lead to greater public expenditures? If so, the Supreme Court has cautioned against using budgetary constraints as a pressing and substantial objective.\n[235] Little of the evidence cited by the Respondent is attributable to Parliament\u2019s intent.[225] The Respondent would have failed to establish a pressing and substantial objective to justify a breach.\nb) Are the means chosen proportional to that object? 1. Rational Connection [236] The Respondent need only show that there is a causal connection between the infringement and the benefit sought on the basis of reason or logic.[226] The standard is not onerous.[227]\n[237] The stay of refugee claimants in Canada is uncertain given that their claims may ultimately be rejected. While the Appellants have made a balanced argument that refugee claimants have a sufficient attachment to Canada, the rationale for the exclusion is still rational, at least to the extent that it is logically linked to the objective.\n[238] The eligibility requirements render those, whose stay in Canada is transient or uncertain, ineligible for the CCB. Refugee claimant stays in Canada are uncertain and may be transient. Thus, there is a rational connection between the exclusion of refugee claimants and the objective.[228]\n[239] Under the IRPA, a refugee claimant is under a conditional removal order pending determination of their claim. By contrast, the statuses listed under paragraph 122.6(e) of the ITA confer a definite right or authorization to enter or remain in Canada.[229] The Appellants argue that a high acceptance rate demonstrates certainty. It is unclear how it does. These rates fluctuate.[230]\n[240] The Appellants argue that Canadian-born children do not have transient or uncertain connections to Canada. However, not all children of refugee claimants are Canadian.[231] Even if refugee claimant has children who are Canadian citizens, the exclusion is rationally connected to the objective. Entitlement to the CCB relates to the parent\u2019s status, as the parent is paid the benefit, not the child.[232] Further, granting the benefit to these children, as opposed to all, would be making a distinction based on citizenship, which is concerning.[233]\n[241] Proportionality does not require perfection and courts must afford the legislature a measure of deference.[234] A higher degree of deference should generally be afforded when considering a complex regulatory response to a social problem.[235]\n2. Minimal Impairment [242] The Supreme Court has explained that financial considerations alone cannot justify Charter infringements, but governments must be afforded wide latitude to determine the proper distribution of resources in society.[236] Determining entitlement to the CCB is a complex policy decision involving high government expenditures.[237]\n[243] The impact of the requirements is minimal because it is temporary if the refugee claims are ultimately accepted or immigration status is obtained by another route.[238] The impact is also limited because refugee claimants may obtain the benefit depending on the status of their spouse or common-law partner, the impact is mitigated by other benefits and programs, and there is no impact on the children of refugee claimants who are in institutional or foster care because those caregivers do not receive the CCB and instead receive a special allowance.[239]\n[244] Parliament has made a parent who lacks the requisite status eligible for the CCB when they have a partner who does have the requisite status. Parliament also decided to make temporary residents who live in Canada for at least 18 months eligible for the benefit. These decisions are the kind of line drawing that warrants deference to Parliament\u2019s role in managing complex circumstances and significant government expenditures.[240]\n[245] In Eldridge, the decision cited by the Respondent regarding government expenditures, the issue was whether a provincial government\u2019s decision to not fund medical interpretation services for the deaf when they received medical services violated s. 15 of the Charter. The Supreme Court found that s. 15 was infringed. In the s. 1 analysis, the Court assumed, without deciding that the objective of controlling healthcare expenditures was pressing and substantial, that the decision was rationally connected to the objective. The Court found that the decision did not constitute a minimum impairment:\nIn the present case, the government has manifestly failed to demonstrate that it had a reasonable basis for concluding that a total denial of medical interpretation services for the deaf constituted a minimum impairment of their rights. As previously noted, the estimated cost of providing sign language interpretation for the whole of British Columbia was only $150,000, or approximately 0.0025 per cent of the provincial health care budget at the time. \u2026 In these circumstances, the refusal to expend such a relatively insignificant sum to continue and extend the service cannot possibly constitute a minimum impairment of the appellants\u2019 constitutional rights.[241]\n[246] The Respondent cites the amount of money the government expends on the CCB. If this factor is determinative, the Respondent would need to provide an estimate concerning how much more the government would have to expend if refugee claimants who have been residing in Canada for at least 18 months were to become eligible for the benefit. Otherwise it is speculation.\n[247] The question is whether there are less harmful means of achieving the legislative goal; a court must determine whether the limit is reasonably tailored to the objective.[242] Restated: does the law \u201cfalls within a range of reasonable alternatives open to Parliament to achieve its objectives? If it is within this range, it should not fail the minimal impairment test merely because, in the Court\u2019s view, an alternative would have been better suited to the objective\u201d.[243]\n[248] The alternative measures need not satisfy the objective to exactly the same extent as the impugned measures, but must substantially achieve the challenged measures\u2019 objective.[244]\n3. Proportionality between deleterious and salutary effects [249] In balancing public versus private rights, \u201cthe Oakes analysis weighs the impact of the law on protected rights against the beneficial effect of the law in terms of the greater public good.\u201d[245] In Ndhlovu,[246] the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[b]enefits that are speculative and marginal in nature carry less weight when balanced against a measure\u2019s significant and tangible deleterious effects\u201d.[247]\n[250] The Respondent argues that the negative effects on refugee claimants whose claims are accepted is arguably partial or limited because they will be entitled to the CCB once their claims are accepted. The negative effect on failed claimants is not limited in this way, unless they obtain the requisite status another way, because failed refugee claimants must leave Canada.[248] Not everyone who enters the country should get a social benefit.[249] As such, the positive effects of the eligibility requirements outweigh any impact on the Charter rights of refugee claimants and their children.[250] Overall, had a violation occurred, the Respondent was short on the measurable public good attained by a Charter violation.\nc) Section 1 Summary [251] The Respondent has not explained what the positive effects of the eligibility requirements are. The Respondent has also not meaningfully dealt with the negative effects that the requirements have on refugee claimants. The fact remains that while the temporary nature of refugee claimant status is theoretically evident, it is empirically much more mediate in duration. Ultimately the Court would have, if necessary, have found that a public good could not in the case countermand the deleterious effect.\nF. Remedy [252] In light of the dismissal of the appeals, the issue of remedy need not be addressed. For completeness, the Court offers some observations.\n[253] The Court notes that the Respondent stated that no remedy was legally available to the Appellants should the Court have allowed the appeals. The Court disagrees.\n[254] While presently moot, these appeals strike the heart of the Court\u2019s exclusive and originating jurisdiction: the correctness of the assessments by the Minister under the ITA. It is precisely within the ITA that an answer is found.\n[255] Under subsection 171(1) of the ITA, the Court may dispose of an appeal by dismissing it, or allowing it and, if so, vacating, varying or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[256] The Court\u2019s reasons for disposition are distinct from its statutory power to grant relief or dismiss. If the Minister\u2019s assessments had been incorrect because of a faulty interpretation of the ITA under the IRPA in Part A, or because of Charter violations in Part B, it would be the reassessments disallowing the CCB which would be incorrect. Those errors would alter the assessment of tax for these taxpayers. In short, the Court\u2019s decision affects the Appellants\u2019 legal rights, as taxpayers. Other refugee claimants, taxpayers, if these appeals had been successful, might then have relied upon such precedent using the principle of stare decisis. For that reason, declaratory relief to invalidate the ITA and invoke subsection 24(1) of the Charter was not in issue because it would not have been needed to provide other taxpayers with a future remedy. In these specific matters, the appeals would have been allowed and the CCB then paid by the Minister.\n[257] In any event, as stated, this is moot given the outcome.\nV. COSTS [258] The parties addressed the issue of costs in passing only and the Court did not request submissions.\n[259] The complexity of the grounds of these two appeals hides their basic nature; these are and remain appeals for the denial of the CCB to two Appellants who a short time ago: fled a communist, totalitarian dictatorship; became refugee claimants, then refugees; and, are now Canadian citizens. Throughout, their near penury has been evident.\n[260] Similarly, counsel for the Appellants and Intervenor acted pro bono publico. The Court applauds this support by them for access to justice.\n[261] The Court\u2019s strong preference is that there be no costs awarded, despite the outcome, the Rules and precedent. If the parties feel strongly otherwise, then within 30 days, they may make submissions in writing. Otherwise, this cost direction shall become final after 30 days after the date of these two judgments.\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 15th day of February 2024.\n\u201cR. S.

The Court in Sharma said that it was not altering the two-step test for s. 15, and just bringing clarity and predictability: at para 33. The bench split markedly on that point: Justice Karakatsanis raised just the opposite concerns in her dissent in Sharma (Justices Martin, Kasirer, and Jamal concurring). She explained that under the guise of \u201cclarity\u201d, the majority sought to revise the test. She stated that the revisions \u201care not only unsolicited, unnecessary, and contrary to stare decisis; they would dislodge foundational premises of our equality jurisprudence.

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 2\nDate: 20240104\nDocket: 2021-1039(GST)APP\nBETWEEN:\nREFIND ENVIRONMENT INC.,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] This is an application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection against assessments under the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cETA\u201d).\n[2] The assessments related to nine reporting periods of the Applicant. The first set of reporting periods began on December 1, 2016 and ended on August 31, 2018. The second set began on December 1, 2018 and ended on May 31, 2019.\n[3] There is no dispute about two critical dates. First, there is no dispute about the date on which the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) sent notices of assessment to the Applicant. That date was November 27, 2019.\n[4] Second, there is no dispute about the date on which the Applicant filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object. That date was February 26, 2021.\n[5] It is also common ground that the Applicant did not file a notice of objection with the Minister within 90 days from the mailing date of the notices of assessment as required by subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA.\n[6] The only issue is whether the Applicant timely filed its application for an extension of time to object.\nPosition of the Crown\n[7] The Crown says the Applicant filed its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object one day late. On the Crown\u2019s theory, the last date on which the Applicant could have filed its application with the Minister was February 25, 2021.\nPosition of the Applicant\n[8] The Applicant says that the last date on which it could have filed its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object was one day later \u2013 February 26, 2021 \u2013 the date on which it actually filed its application.\nThe Excise Tax Act\n[9] Subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA allows 90 days from the mailing date of the notice of assessment to file a notice of objection. If one misses that deadline, paragraph 303(7)(a) allows an additional year to file an application with the Minister to extend time to object. If the Minister refuses the application one may proceed to the Court to grant the application but, under paragraph 304(5)(a), the Court cannot grant the application if it was not filed with the Minister within that additional year.\n[10] I have reproduced the relevant provisions in their statutory context [with emphasis added]:\nObjection to assessment\n301(1.1) Any person who has been assessed and who objects to the assessment may, within ninety days after the day notice of the assessment is sent to the person, file with the Minister a notice of objection in the prescribed form and manner setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts.\n***\nExtension of time by Minister\n303(1) Where no objection to an assessment is filed under section 301 \u2026 within the time limit otherwise provided, a person may make an application to the Minister to extend the time for filing a notice of objection \u2026 and the Minister may grant the application.\n***\nDuties of Minister\n303(5) On receipt of an application made under subsection (1), the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, consider the application and grant or refuse it, and shall thereupon notify the person of the decision by registered or certified mail.\n***\nWhen order to be made\n303(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ; and\n(b) the person demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting,\n(A) the person was unable to act or to give a mandate to act in the person\u2019s name, or\n(B) the person had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026 ,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted it to be made.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n304(1) A person who has made an application under section 303 may apply to the Tax Court to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) ninety days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 303(1) and the Minister has not notified the person of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of thirty days after the day the decision has been mailed to the person under subsection 303(5).\n***\nPowers of Court\n304(4) The Tax Court may dispose of an application made under subsection (1) by\n(a) dismissing it, or\n(b) granting it,\nand in granting an application, it may impose such terms as it deems just or order that the notice of objection or the request be deemed to be a valid objection \u2026 as of the date of the order.\nWhen application to be granted\n304(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ; and\n(b) the person demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for objecting,\n(A) the person was unable to act or to give a mandate to act in the person\u2019s name, or\n(B) the person had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026 ,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 303(1) as soon as circumstances permitted it to be made.\n[11] Two timing questions arise for consideration. The first relates to the 90\u2011day objection period and the second relates to the one-year application period.\nThe 90 Day Objection Period\n[12] The answer to the first timing question turns on the interpretation of subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA which sets out the 90-day deadline to file a notice of objection:\n301(1.1) Any person who has been assessed and who objects to the assessment may, within ninety days after the day notice of the assessment is sent to the person, file with the Minister a notice of objection in the prescribed form and manner setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts.\n[13] In its submissions, the Applicant places considerable emphasis on the word \u201cafter\u201d in the phrase in subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA which provides that a notice of objection must be filed within ninety days after the day that notice of the assessment is sent to the person.\n[14] The Applicant contends that the word \u201cafter\u201d means that the 90-day clock to file a notice of objection commences on the day after the Minister sent the notice of assessment. As the Minister sent notices of assessment to the Applicant on November 27, 2019, we should count the 90 days commencing on November 28, 2019.\n[15] In support of its position, the Applicant refers to subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act:\n27(4) Where a time is expressed to begin after \u2026 a specified day, the time does not include that day.\n27(5) Where anything is to be done within a time after \u2026 a specified day, the time does not include that day.[1]\n[16] The Crown agrees with that proposition.[2] I am satisfied that this reading of subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA reflects its proper interpretation.\n[17] The Applicant then argues that because the 90-day clock commenced on November 28, 2019 (the day after the mailing of the notices of assessment), the 90th day fell on February 26, 2020.[3] Under the Applicant\u2019s theory, the last day for filing a notice of objection would have been February 26, 2020.\n[18] The Applicant\u2019s computation of the 90-day objection period is wrong. If we start counting on the day after the mailing date of the notices of assessment, namely, on November 28, 2019, the 90th day actually fell on February 25, 2020. Because the notice of objection had to be filed within those 90 days, the deadline to file a notice of objection fell on February 25, 2020. That was the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection without having to apply for an extension of time.\n[19] Based on subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act, I am satisfied that February 25, 2020 was the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection with the Minister.\n[20] Now that we have established that date, how do we compute the one-year period to apply for an extension of time?\nThe One Year Application Period\n[21] The answer to the second timing question turns on the interpretation of paragraphs 303(7)(a) and 304(5)(a) of the ETA which set out the one year period for filing an application to extend time to object:\n303(7) No application shall be granted [by the Minister] under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n***\n304(5) No application shall be granted [by the Tax Court] under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n[22] We have already established that the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection with the Minister was February 25, 2020.\n[23] The Applicant argues that the one-year application period should be counted starting the day after February 25, 2020. In that regard, it relies once again on subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act.\n[24] If the Applicant\u2019s theory is correct, the last day to file its application was February 26, 2021 \u2013 the day on which it was actually filed.\n[25] The Applicant\u2019s approach to the computation of the one-year application period is wrong. I agree with the Crown that February 25, 2021 was the last day on which an application to extend time to object could have been filed with the Minister.\n[26] The flaw in the Applicant\u2019s argument arises from conflating units of time. The provision dealing with the objection period uses the unit of a day to compute time. The provisions dealing with the application period use the unit of a year to compute time.\n[27] Subsection 37(1) of the Interpretation Act is the relevant provision where the benchmark is a year \u2013 not subsections 27(4) or 27(5). Subsection 37(1) of the Interpretation Act simply tells us that the expression \u201cyear\u201d means any period of twelve consecutive months.[4]\n[28] We now return to the provisions at issue:\n303(7) No application shall be granted [by the Minister] under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n***\n304(5) No application shall be granted [by the Tax Court] under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n[29] The expression \u201cwithin one year after the expiration of the time\u201d means exactly that \u2013 within one year after the expiration of the 90 days. The last date that falls within one year after February 25, 2020 is February 25, 2021.\nConclusion\n[30] The Applicant did not file its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object within the time required by paragraph 303(7)(a) of the ETA. I must, therefore, dismiss the Applicant\u2019s application and shall do so without costs. Finally, I am grateful to both counsel for their thorough oral and written submissions.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 4th day of January 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

It states:\nInsurable employment does not include\n\u2026\n(i) employment if the employer and employee are not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length.\n[5] In applying Paragraph 5(2)(i) one must take account of subsection 5(3) of that Act:\nFor the purposes of paragraph (2)(i),\n(a) the question of whether persons are not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length shall be determined in accordance with the Income Tax Act; and\n(b) if the employer is, within the meaning of that Act, related to the employee, they are deemed to deal with each other at arm\u2019s length if the Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the employment, including the remuneration paid, the terms and conditions, the duration and the nature and importance of the work performed, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length.\n(Emphasis added)\n[6] Subsection 251(1) of the Income Tax Act sets provides that:\nFor the purposes of this Act,\n(a) related persons shall be deemed not to deal with each other at arm's length;\n(b) \u2026 and[3]\n(c) in any other case, it is a question of fact whether persons not related to each other are, at a particular time, dealing with each other at arm's length.\n[7] There is no suggestion that the Appellant and Intervenor are related persons within the meaning of paragraph 251(1)(a). Accordingly, as directed by paragraph 251(1)(c) one must determine if the Appellant and the Intervenor are dealing at arm\u2019s length during the period in issue.[4]\n[8] If they are at arm\u2019s length, that is the end of the matter and the Intervenor is in insurable employment.\n[9] If they are not dealing at arm\u2019s length, subsection 5(3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act has no application given that the Appellant and the Intervenor are not related persons.\n[10] However, while the perspective is different, considerations contained in subsection 5(3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act are relevant to the determination of whether the parties are factually at arm\u2019s length.[5]\nThe Facts\n[11] The Appellant was started in 1963 by Mike Kichton. Ownership evolved over time and in the first half of the 1990s Fred Kichton and Mike Kichton Junior took over the company. By 2002 Fred Kichton was the sole owner.[6]\n[12] The Appellant is in the business of providing commercial, industrial and residential earthmoving and related services.\n[13] The Intervenor started working for the appellant in 2002 during the summer months. He began operating equipment; his recollection is that even during his first summer he was an operating foreman. Around 2006 Fred asked the Intervenor to start working full time. He subsequently became a senior project manager, one of the most senior positions in the company.\n[14] In 2007 the Intervenor became a shareholder. At that time he acquired 10% of the shares of the Appellant.\n[15] Fred Kichton was the President of the company.[7]\n[16] The Intervenor never became a director.\n[17] The Intervenor and Fred got along very well. The Intervenor described Fred as being \u201clike a father figure\u201d with a good relationship that continued until late 2019. He was fired on February 20, 2020.[8]\n[18] Although it is not clear when, at some point before April 2013, Fred started planning and executing arrangements for his eventual retirement and for turning over the Appellant company to key individuals in the company including his son, Richard Kichton, and the Intervenor.\n[19] Richard and Fred Kichton were related persons within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.[9]\n[20] Part of Fred\u2019s exiting the company involved a buy back of Fred\u2019s shares by the Appellant. While the evidence does not disclose the details of the transaction, it resulted in $7.4 million becoming payable to his company, Fredco. This loan, the Fredco loan, is referred to in the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement.[10]\n[21] The loan was payable over 7 years resulting in an expected final payment in 2020.\n[22] As previously stated Fred was the President of the Appellant. In addition, until such time as the loan was paid off, the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement provided Fred with very significant powers over the company.\n[23] Under the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement Fredco could \u201c\u2026 veto, repeal, otherwise reverse any resolution or decision of the Directors or any officer or employee of the corporation, previously, or about to be made \u2026\u201d[11]\n[24] Dividends could not be declared without Fred\u2019s consent.[12]\n[25] By the time of the effective date of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, April 2, 2013, Fred no longer had any shares of the company; however, he and his company, Fredco, were signatories of the agreement.\n[26] The shareholders at that date were: 1) the Intervenor who, directly or through a company[13] owned jointly with his spouse, owned 20% of the shares of Appellant, 2) Richard Kichton who directly or through a company owned 25% of the shares of the Appellant, 3) Christopher Dirks who directly or through a company owned 25% of the shares of the appellant and 4) Laurie Conrad who directly or through a company owned 20% of the shares of the Appellant. In addition Matus Toth and Cody Williams each had 5%.[14]\n[27] The owners were also key employees.\n[28] The Notice of Appeal alleges that the Intervenor and the other shareholders had the ability to determine their own salaries and the amount of dividends they would receive. That was admitted by the respondent but not the Intervenor.[15]\n[29] While the respondent admitted those allegations, the corresponding assumptions made by the respondent were phrased somewhat differently. They said the Intervenor and the other shareholders of the appellant collectively determined the terms and conditions of employment the Intervenor.[16]\n[30] With respect to salary, while the evidence is not entirely consistent, I have reached the conclusion that there was some kind of largely collective decision-making involving the owners and Fred with respect to the salaries and dividends of the employee owners including the Intervenor. I have no doubt that given Fred\u2019s rights under the Unanimous shareholders Agreement[17] as well as his role as President, his views would have carried great weight in such discussions.[18]\n[31] The Intervenor was content to go along with whatever decisions were made as to the optimal division at to what he and other owners would receive as salary, bonus or dividends.[19]\n[32] Indeed, the Intervenor agreed in cross-examination that he and the other employees would receive varying salary and\/or dividends with the understanding that lower remuneration in the bad years would be offset by varying salary and\/or dividends in the good years.[20]\n[33] The Intervenor was in a unique position. All the project managers reported to him, including Grant Campbell.[21]\n[34] Under the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement any shareholder who ceases to be a shareholder is deemed to have resigned from their employment without any right of compensation.[22] The Intervenor had been an employee of the company for quite a long time before he signed the USA and thereby agreed to this condition.\n[35] The Unanimous Shareholders Agreement provides that the corporation may require shareholders to loan money to the corporation[23] and may require shareholders to provide guarantees of the corporation to banks and lenders[24]\n[36] Sometime around 2010 the Appellant did earthworks for another company[25] that was developing a subdivision. The Appellant was paid with lots in the subdivision.\n[37] Some of these lots were transferred to the owners and Fred although the transfers were not all done in the same year. Eventually, the owners lived in that subdivision.\n[38] The transfer of the lots to employees was done by declaring bonuses equal to the value of the lot. In the Intervenor\u2019s case this occurred in 2014.[26]\nAnalysis\n[39] It is well accepted in the income tax context the question of whether persons who are not related are dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length should be examined by considering the following questions[27]:\nwas there a common mind which directs the bargaining for both parties to a transaction,\nwere the parties to a transaction acting in concert without separate interests and\nwas there \u201cde facto\u201d control?[28]\n[40] It is recognized by this court that it is difficult to apply this kind of analysis, which was developed in examining transactions for income tax purposes, in the context of examining whether people in employment relationships are at arm\u2019s length from their employer.[29]\n[41] It is also accepted that one may examine all the circumstances of the employment relationship to determine whether the terms and conditions of the employment relationship are substantially similar to those which parties at arm\u2019s length would agree upon.[30]\n[42] If the terms and conditions of employment are far removed from what one can expect between arm\u2019s length parties that is a strong indication of not dealing at arm\u2019s length.[31]\n[43] This exercise can be a difficult one. If a particular individual has a position which is one a number of very similar positons the exercise can be quite straightforward but the more unique the position the more difficult the exercise.\n[44] The parties pointed out particular examples of certain terms and conditions that were, or were not, in their submission, consistent with an arm\u2019s length arrangement.\n[45] In examining whether or not the terms and conditions are substantially similar to those that would exist in an arm\u2019s length relationship it is important to keep in mind two considerations.\n[46] First, one must compare substantially similar positions. One would expect the terms and conditions of an equipment operator to be different from those of a project manager, for example. If some types of skills are in short supply that may result in different levels of remuneration for such positions as compared to otherwise similar positions not requiring those skills and not in short supply.\n[47] Similarly, differences between employees that relate to their role in a company or that do not increase their remuneration, whether in salary or benefits, are not relevant to this exercise.[32]\n[48] Secondly, if a difference with other employees is solely the result of his being a shareholder that is not a term or condition of employment.\n[49] Thus the fact that the Intervenor made shareholder loans to the company and provided bank guarantees, something that the company could require under the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement are not part of the employment relationship.[33]\n[50] With respect to the traditional tests, on the evidence, I do not see how it can be said that there is a common mind directing both the appellant and the Intervenor setting the terms and conditions of the Intervenor\u2019s employment. Similarly I do not see how one could conclude that either the appellant or the Intervenor has de facto control of the other.\n[51] With respect to the remaining test, the owner employees, including the Intervenor, and Fred are acting in concert in setting the remuneration of owner employees and with respect to the split between remuneration of the owners and dividends.\n[52] In so doing they are acting without separate interests because they are taking account of each others interests as employees and as shareholders and acting not only for their own individual benefit but also for the benefit of the others in a context of reciprocity.[34]\n[53] This leads to the conclusion that Appellant and the Intervenor were not at arm\u2019s length.\n[54] Turning to the terms and conditions of employment, there are a number of factors not previously discussed that do not point clearly one way or the other.\n[55] For example, the Intervenor had a salary less than Grant Campbell, a person who reported to the Appellant. However, when one takes account of salary and bonuses the Intervenor he clearly received higher remuneration in the years we can compare. That is not an unusual result.[35]\n[56] In addition it appears that the Intervenor had what he referred as a $25,000 spending account. If I understand correctly the evidence this meant that he could use for personal purposes some of the Appellant\u2019s earthmoving equipment for up to a certain amount of usage equal to that amount. He did make use of equipment. This is an unusual benefit but some benefits relate to the type of business one works in. It has value and increases his remuneration but it does not appear to me clear that the overall remuneration is excessive to the point of demonstrating that the terms and conditions could not be arm\u2019s length terms and conditions.[36]\n[57] There was evidence that there were somewhat more flexible work arrangements with respect to time and place of work of the intervenor. This is not uncommon where an employer is dealing with a trusted senior employee so long as the job is getting done and the individual is physically present when in person interaction is needed. Arm\u2019s length parties could certainly have agreed on such terms. [37]\n[58] There are three factors that are not consistent with a contract substantially similar to the one that persons at arm\u2019s length would agree upon.\nThe Intervenor\u2019s acceptance of very significantly varying remuneration on the basis that lower remuneration in bad years of the business will be offset by higher remuneration and\/or dividends in good years.[38]\nThe fact that the Intervenor as an employee has a say on the employer\u2019s side of the bargain even if that say is limited.\nAgreeing to one\u2019s automatic termination as an employee if one ceases to own shares is not something that an arm\u2019s length employee would agree to.[39]\n[59] These factors lead me to conclude that overall the terms and conditions of this contract are not substantially similar to those one would fin in an arm\u2019s length contract.\nConclusion\n[60] Consequently, the Intervenor and the Appellant are not dealing at arm\u2019s length and the appeal will be allowed and:\nThe decision of the Minister of National Revenue is varied to reflect that Russ Giselbrecht was not in insurable employment for the period January 7, 2019 to February 20, 2020.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 15th day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

M.N.R. 2023 TCC 53 at paragraph 99.\n[2] Like all employment insurance appeals, this appeal is heard under a modified form of the Informal Procedure. See paragraph 18.29 of the Tax Court of Canada Act and the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure respecting the Employment Insurance Act. Among the applicable provisions is subsection 18.15(3) which states: \u2026the Court is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting a hearing and the appeal shall be dealt with by the Court as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit.\n[3] This paragraph relates to taxpayers and personal trusts and has no relevance to this appeal.\n[4] Relevant facts prior to the period provide context to the relationships and may be consider in making the determination.\n[5] See discussion below.\n[6] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.177.\n[7] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.17.]\n[8] Transcript of the 8 March 2023, p.63.\n[9] No one else relevant to the issues in this appeal was related within the meaning of the ITA.\n[10] See Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.66 and 167 as well as the definition of \u201cFredco Loans\u201d on page 4 of Exhibit R-1, Tab 4.\n[11] See Article 3.02.02 of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, on page 12 of Exhibit R-1, Tab 4 as well as Article 1.01.01(ff) at page 6 of that Agreement. There are other places where that agreement provides Fred with other special powers, notably at articles 6.01.05 and .06 as well as 9.03.02(b) the Agreement.\n[12] See Article 9.02.02 of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement.\n[13] The appellant owned all of the voting shares of that company.\n[14] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.208 and 210. It would appear that Cody Williams ceased to be a shareholder in the middle of 2019 and Matus Toth may have ceased to be a shareholder before that.\n[15] See paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Notice of Appeal, paragraph 2 of the Reply to Notice of Appeal and paragraph 20 of the Notice of intervention.\n[16] See subparagraphs 13c, q and s of the Reply to Notice of Appeal.\n[17] The USA is in exhibit R-1, Tab 4.\n[18] While the Intervenor stated that he did not feel that he had much influence, he did agree that the salaries resulted from a discussion among the owners and Fred where they all went along with what was fair. Richard Kichton also testified that salaries and dividends were determined as a group. See transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 17, 18 and 157.\n[19] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, pages 77, 78 (especially in the middle of the page), and 112, as well as 94, 95 with respect to the transfer of the lots to, among others, the employee owners, a subject I shall discuss later.\n[20] See, inter alia, the transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 164 and 165.\n[21] Testimony of Richard Kichton, transcript of the 8 March 2023, page 118. Although Mr. Campbell became a Senior Project Manager, the same title as the Intervenor, on or about 27 February 2018, it is clear from the offer letter that he reported \u201cdirectly to Russ Giselbrecht, with additional reporting to the ownership group.\u201d It may well be that the management of the project managers was light because everyone knew their role and performed it well but it is quite clear that there was a line of authority when needed. See also exhibit A-4.\n[22] See article 9.16.01 of the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement.\n[23] Article 9.07.03\n[24] Article 9.08.01\n[25] A numbered company of which the Intervenor was a shareholder.\n[26] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing at pages 36, 49 to 51, 94, 95, 161 and 215. While the Intervenor\u2019s recollection was that there were probably dividends equal to the value of the lots, Laurie Conrad\u2019s recollection was that it was by way of bonus equal to the value of the lots. On this point I accept Laurie Conrad\u2019s evidence because she was the Corporate Controller of the Appellant and it is consistent with the T4s and T5s in evidence: see Exhibits A-2 and A-3. Some documents show Laurie Conrad as Laurie Schreiner; both names are the same person.\n[27] Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2008] 2 SCR 79 at paragraph 62.\n[28] i.e. one person directing both sides of the transaction. See Keybrand Foods Inc. v. Canada, 2020 FCA 201 at paragraphs 50 to 53.\n[29] See Martel v. M.N.R., 2017 TCC 238 at paragraphs 63 to 65.\n[30] See Martel v. M.N.R., 2017 TCC 238 at paragraph 66. While at first this may seem surprising as an approach, I would note that this is done in other areas as well for example, see Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at paragraphs 78 to 90.]\n[31] See Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at paragraph 84 by analogy.\n[32] Thus, the provision of a credit card to pay for business expenses is not relevant to the examination given that it has not been shown that it was provided to the Intervenor to allow him to incur personal expenses. Similarly, the fact that he had a key that gave him access to more of the office than others had does not confer any benefit forming part of remuneration for him and does not assist the examination. Also, if he received the key qua shareholder it is not relevant. There is no need to determine in which capacity he received the key.\n[33] The shareholder loans were done by journal entries; dividends or bonuses were declared and then loaned back to the company. The Intervenor believes it was done by dividend; see transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 52 and 53.\n[34] See Gestion Yvan Drouin Inc. v. The Queen, 2000 CanLII 407 (TCC) at paragraph 75.\n[35] In the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 Grant Campbell earned more in two of those years; however, in the remaining year the Intervenor\u2019s total remuneration was such that for the three years as a whole the Intervenor earned roughly $67,000 more than Mr. Campbell. Because the Intervenor was fired early in 2020 one can not make any comparison in that year. There is no data on Mr. Campbell\u2019s earnings prior to 2017.\n[36] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing at pages 125 to 128. It appears that he was not the only owner employee with such a spending account. There was evidence that other employees could also use equipment for personal purposes but not to the same extent and not with respect to very big equipment; their use was subject to more controls. It is not uncommon for more senior employees to be given greater latitude.\nAlso, to the extent that it may have been suggested that there was use in excess of what was permitted that would be outside of the employment contract.\nIt may be that use of the equipment was a shareholder benefit, in which case, the use would not be relevant.\n[37] Another area the evidence does not allow one to draw conclusions is the evidence relating to travel and sports tickets. Unfortunately, while there is evidence of differences between employees, it is not clear to what extent those result from different roles in relation to business promotion and client relations. Nor is it clear which of those expenses are employee benefits and to what extent the Appellant was a beneficiary as opposed to others.\n[38] I note that this is not like a remuneration package where there is a clear profit sharing scheme or bonuses based on individual performance. The Intervenor\u2019s remuneration is conveniently set out in the right hand column for each year on the last line of the table in Schedule A to the Notice of appeal. Those numbers are supported by Exhibit A 2.\n[39] In addition, receiving a large bonus in the form of a subdivision lot in the context of the Appellant having received payments in lots for its services is not what would be an arm\u2019s length contract.\n",

Piccolo\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nBenjamin Chamberland\nKatie Beahen\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nLafleur J.\nI. REASSESSMENTS AND CONCESSIONS\n[1] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) reassessed Mr. Yu Xing He (the \u201cAppellant\u201d or \u201cMr. He\u201d) under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Applying the net worth method, the Minister added additional net business income totalling $6,281,338 in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s income. Furthermore, the Minister assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act for all taxation years.\n[2] Following the Appellant\u2019s objection, the Minister varied the reassessments by decreasing the unreported business income by an amount of approximately $3.6M to an aggregate of $2,658,753, namely: $352,662; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $571,474, for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively. In varying the reassessments, the Minister determined that gains on real estate dispositions were to be considered on a capital account rather than on an income account. Some further adjustments were made to take into account additional assets, additional gifts, a change in the value of a shareholder\u2019s\u2019 loan account (reduction), and an additional reduction by taking into account the non-taxable portion of capital gains on the disposition of assets. Penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act were also adjusted accordingly.\n[3] At the hearing, the parties jointly submitted a partial agreed statement of facts (Exhibit RA-1 \u2013 Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, attached to these reasons as Schedule A). These include specific facts regarding the Appellant\u2019s background, reported income, assets and liabilities for the net worth analysis, and the calculation of discrepancy in total income per the net worth analysis. However, the parties did not agree on facts regarding various loans and gifts the Appellant alleged he received during the taxation years under appeal, the amount the Appellant contributed to the shareholders\u2019 loan account of 2225903 Ontario Inc. (\u201cSeasons\u201d), and whether specific withdrawals found in various bank accounts were business expenses incurred for Seasons or personal expenditures of the Appellant.\n[4] Under Exhibit R-6, the Respondent produced amended schedules, consisting of Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets), Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities), Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth), Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and Schedule V (Analysis of Income Tax Discrepancy per Net Worth). These schedules were produced to replace the various schedules attached to the Reply to the Notice of Appeal and took into account various concessions made by the Respondent at the beginning and in the course of the trial, which I will describe below.\n[5] At the beginning of the trial, the Respondent made the following concessions:\ni)An amount of $493,000 representing the cost of a property located at 147 Purcell Square, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cPurcell Property\u201d), shall be added as an asset on Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) for 2008, with a corresponding long term liability of $432,562 as a mortgage to be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2008;\nii)An amount of $17,700 representing two gifts received by Mr. He shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2012 (see Exhibit RA\u20111, paras. 122\u2013123); and\niii)An amount of $110,452 shall reduce the item \u201cother\u201d in the personal expenditures calculation in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) for 2012, which amount was already included in the asset section of the Balance Sheet (Schedule I: Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in respect of a property located at 4903-14th Avenue, in Markham, Ontario.\n[6] Furthermore, during the trial, the Respondent conceded the following:\ni)An amount of $89,120 representing the total deposits made for the purchase of a property located at 3610-25 Telegram Mews, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cTelegram Mews Property\u201d), shall be added as an asset on Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) for 2008;\nii)An amount of $6,615, representing the non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Telegram Mews Property, shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2009; and\niii)An amount of $421, representing the non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of a property located at 1911-33 Singer Court (the \u201cSinger Property\u201d), shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2012.\n[7] Given the above concessions, and according to the Respondent, the Appellant\u2019s unreported business income using the net worth assessment method for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years was respectively established at $196,490; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $442,901, for a total of $2,374,008.\n[8] At trial, Mr. He testified, as did Mr. Benjamin Battiste, the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) appeal officer who reviewed Mr. He\u2019s files at the CRA\u2019s appeal level. Furthermore, Mr. He called the following individuals to testify: Mr. Fei Chen (Mr. He\u2019s nephew), Mr. Guo Lin He (Mr. He\u2019s cousin), and Mr. Hui Min Shi (Mr. He\u2019s brother-in-law).\n[9] All statutory references that follow in these reasons are to the Act unless otherwise stated.\nII. BACKGROUND\n[10] Mr. He immigrated to Canada in 2003, after completing his high school education in China. His first job in Canada was in a supermarket, around 2007. In 2009, he planned to open a supermarket with partners. Between 2009 and 2012, Mr. He was married and living with his spouse and two minor children in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario.\n[11] Since 2004, he and his spouse have jointly owned the Purcell Property, part of which has been rented out since its purchase. Mr. He has also been involved in the purchase and sale of multiple pre-construction properties.\n[12] Mr. He and his spouse reported the following net income for income tax purposes (see Exhibit RA-1, Partial Agreed Statements of Facts, paras. 7\u201342):\n2009: $19,458 (including taxable capital gains and net rental income);\n2010: $22,301 (including net rental income and net business income);\n2011: $25,189 (including taxable capital gains and net rental income); and\n2012: $20,570 (for Mr. He only, including net rental income and employment income; no evidence was adduced at trial on the net income reported by his spouse, but she reported net rental income of $6,857).\n[13] As mentioned above, the reassessments at issue were determined by a net worth analysis. This method is \u201cbased on an assumption that if one subtracts a taxpayer\u2019s net worth at the beginning of a year from that at the end, adds the taxpayers expenditures in the year, deletes non-taxable receipts and accretions to value of existing assets, the net result, less any amount declared by the taxpayer, must be attributable to unreported income earned in the year, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate otherwise\u201d (see Bigayan v. R (1999), [2000] 1 CTC 2229, 2000 DTC 1619 [Bigayan], at para. 2).\n[14] The personal expenditures of Mr. He were determined by the CRA by adding all withdrawals, cheques, drafts and debit memos found in various bank accounts statements and credit cards statements, and deducting all transfers made between bank accounts and all business expenses paid through these bank accounts.\n[15] Mr. He attributes the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth to various loans he had received from friends and family over the years, as well as large gifts mostly from his father-in-law, who lives in China.\nIII. ISSUES\n[16] The issues arising from this appeal are as follows:\ni)Given the concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing, has unreported income been properly determined for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years as being respectively $196,490; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $442,901, for a total of $2,374,008?\nii)Were the 2009 to 2012 taxation years properly reassessed beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i)?\niii)Were penalties under subsection 163(2) properly assessed for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years?\nIV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nA. The Respondent\u2019s position\n[17] The examination of the various bank accounts shows that the Mr. He did not report all of his income, the source of which is unknown to the Minister. As the Appellant is unable to offer a credible explanation for the source of these funds, the Minister has met his burden to reassess the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) as well as to assess penalties under subsection 163(2). The evidence also showed that Mr. He was given opportunities to make representations in that respect.\n[18] The amount of unreported income, as calculated and detailed in the various schedules found under Exhibit R-6, should be included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s income.\n[19] Mr. Battiste\u2019s testimony was clear that a thorough analysis of the Appellant\u2019s records was made, with no need for estimates.\n[20] Mr. He lacks credibility when he claims that he had received various loans and gifts over the years, as the issue of these loans and gifts was not raised at audit or on appeal, but only during discovery.\n[21] Further, no credible evidence was adduced at trial to allow the Court to conclude that Mr. He did receive these loans and gifts.\n[22] Apart from concessions already made by the Respondent at trial, no other adjustments should be made to the net worth calculations.\nB. The Appellant\u2019s position\n[23] The requirements for reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period were not met by the Minister as the evidence showed that Mr. He carefully reviewed his tax returns before filing them, and that he knew gifts and loans were not taxable. The Court has to take into account the fact that Mr. He was a recent immigrant, having arrived in Canada in 2004. Mr. He did not show any carelessness or neglect in filing his tax returns, and it cannot be concluded that he willfully underreported his income. The evidence showed that Mr. He actively sought his accountant\u2019s advice. Furthermore, for the same reasons, the Minister did not meet his burden in respect of penalties assessed under subsection 163(2).\n[24] However, if the Court is satisfied that the Minister met the requirements for reassessing Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), 38 adjustments (including adjustments referred to in the concessions made by the Respondent as described above) to the schedules attached to the Reply to the Notice of Appeal should be made to arrive at unreported income totalling $998,916, specifically: (-$752); $315,405; $460,406; and $223,857 for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively. These adjustments to the net worth calculations include the various loans and gifts Mr. He allegedly received from friends and family members, including his father-in-law.\nV. CONCLUSION\n[25] In accordance with these reasons, I find that the Minister has met his burden to reassess Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years, and to assess penalties under subsection 163(2).\n[26] Further, in accordance with these reasons, the appeal from the reassessments made under the Act for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years is allowed, with costs to the Respondent, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the unreported income of Mr. He is to be reduced by taking into account the following adjustments to be made to the net worth calculations (which amounts include concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing and additional adjustments described below):\nFor 2009\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): add the deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275 (as it was included in 2008);\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Chen for $80,000 (as it was included in 2008);\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add deductions for $4,269.95 (cheque from the Government of Canada) and for $6,615 (non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Telegram Mews Property); and\nAdditional adjustments to the 2008 taxation year (as described below).\nFor 2010\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): add the deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275 (as it was included in 2008) and the deposit on Fulham Property for $20,000;\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Chen for $60,000 (as the original loan was partially reimbursed) and a loan from Mr. Guo Lin He for $12,000; and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $43,033, consisting of $20,000 (deposit on the Fulham Property), $20,000 (partial reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Chen) and $3,033 (Budget Rent-A-Car payments).\nFor 2011\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Yang for $5,300;\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add a deduction for $46,275 (refund of deposit on the Splendid China Square Property); and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $146,524, consisting of $60,000 (reimbursement of the balance of a loan from Mr. Chen), $12,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Guo Lin He), $10,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Yang), $35,000 (amount paid to Mr. Chen) and $29,524 (Costco payments).\nFor 2012\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Yang for $5,300 (as it was included in 2011);\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add a deduction for $421 (non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Singer Property) and for $17,700 (gifts received by Mr. He); and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $153,766, consisting of $20,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Yang), $23,314 (Costco payments) and $110,452 (representing a deposit for a property located at 4903-14th Avenue, in Markham, Ontario).\n[27] Penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) shall be adjusted accordingly.\n[28] In accordance with these reasons, I also find that additional assets and liabilities shall be added to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) and to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for the 2008 taxation year (which year is not under appeal) to take into account concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing and additional adjustments described below:\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): Purcell Property for $493,000, deposit on the Telegram Mews Property for $89,120 and deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275; and\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): loan from Mr. Chen for $80,000 and liability (mortgage) in respect of the Purcell Property for $432,562.\nVI. ANALYSIS\nA. The net worth method\n[29] The Minister is not bound by a return or information supplied by a taxpayer, or on his or her behalf, and may use an alternative audit method to assess the tax payable (subsection 152(7)).\n[30] As indicated above, the Minister used a net worth method to reassess Mr. He for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Mr. Battiste, the CRA appeal officer, testified that the audit conducted by the CRA was a thorough review of financial records, as no estimates or statistics were used to determine the unreported income. The bank withdrawal method was used under the net worth analysis. The auditor obtained various bank accounts statements (including line of credit statements) and credit card statements through the CRA\u2019s power to obtain information and did a withdrawal analysis. The CRA was able to identify 10 bank accounts and lines of credits held by Mr. He and his spouse. Mr. He did not provide any bank statements or credit cards statements to the CRA. Under the withdrawal analysis, specific amounts were recognized as business expenses, and inter-account transfers and mortgage payments were identified, and these amounts were removed from the calculation of personal expenditures found in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) to avoid any double counting of amounts.\n[31] I found that the testimony of Mr. Battiste was clear and credible.\n[32] As a general rule, in an appeal to this Court, the burden of proof rests on the taxpayer. A taxpayer thus bears the burden of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his or her position. On the other hand, the Minister has the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying the assessment of penalties under subsection 163(2) (subsection 163(3)) and the facts justifying reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period (subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i)).\n[33] In the case at bar, reassessments were made beyond the normal reassessment period. The Minister will discharge his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) if he establishes that \u201cthere is a discrepancy . . . between a taxpayer\u2019s assets and his expenses, and that discrepancy continues to be unexplained and inexplicable\u201d (see Molenaar v. Canada, 2004 FCA 349 at para. 4, cited with approval in Lacroix v. The Queen, 2008 FCA 241 [Lacroix], at para. 33).\n[34] Further, as stated in Lacroix (at para. 32):\n[i]nsofar as the Tax Court of Canada is satisfied that the taxpayer earned unreported income and did not provide a credible explanation for the discrepancy between his or her reported income and his or her net worth, the Minister has discharged the burden of proof on him within the meaning of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) and subsection 162(3) [sic].\n[35] If the Minister discharges his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), it will then be on Mr. He to identify the source of the income and to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the income is not taxable. Mr. He will have to prove, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his position. Mr. He can also challenge the net worth reassessment by establishing that the net worth method was inherently flawed (see Bigayan, supra, at paras. 3\u20134).\n[36] In order to successfully challenge the reassessments at issue, Mr. He must present detailed and cogent testimony, and supporting evidence where possible, to explain the various withdrawals found in his bank accounts and why they should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures. Mr. He can also succeed either by establishing, on a balance of probabilities, new facts, not considered by the Minister, showing that the unreported income was not taxable (for example, by proving he had received various gifts and loans), or by demonstrating that the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact are wrong. For example, Mr. He can present evidence supporting he owned additional assets and incurred more liabilities.\n[37] It is possible that Mr. He\u2019s burden will not be met if the Respondent successfully challenges the evidence adduced at the hearing, if the evidence is contradictory or if the Court draws a negative inference from Mr. He\u2019s failure to produce evidence or to call witnesses to establish a central facts relied upon by him.\n[38] Thus, Mr. He\u2019s credibility and the sufficiency of his evidence will be determinative (Landry v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 399, at paragraph 47; Roy v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 226). This Court, however, may also consider the overall reasonableness of the reassessments in its determination of whether to allow the appeal.\n[39] Courts have recognized that a net worth assessment is an arbitrary and imprecise approximation of a taxpayer\u2019s income. However, the Federal Court of Appeal noted the following in Hsu v. The Queen, 2001 FCA 240, at para. 30:\nAny perceived unfairness relating to this type of assessment is resolved by recognizing that the taxpayer is in the best position to know his or her own taxable income. Where the factual basis of the Minister\u2019s estimation is inaccurate, it should be a simple matter for the taxpayer to correct the Minister\u2019s error to the satisfaction of the Court.\n[40] For the following reasons, which I will elaborate upon later herein, I find that the Minister has established, on a balance of probabilities, facts justifying the reassessments made beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years and facts justifying the assessment of penalties under subsection 163(2). I find that Mr. He had earned unreported income that he failed to report. Further, I also find that Mr. He did not provide credible explanations for the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth. Some parts of Mr. He\u2019s testimony were credible, and, as such, I find that some adjustments must be made to the Minister\u2019s calculations under the net worth assessment. However, I also find that other parts of Mr. He\u2019s testimony were not credible and, as such, I did not accept all the adjustments raised by the Appellant.\nB. Credibility of Mr. He, reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period and penalties\n(1) Credibility of Mr. He\n[41] When assessing the credibility of a witness, I can consider inconsistencies, the attitude and demeanour of the witness, motives the witness may have to fabricate evidence, and the \u201coverall sense of the evidence\u201d. As stated by Justice Valerie Miller in Nichols v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 334:\n[23] In assessing credibility I can consider inconsistencies or weaknesses in the evidence of witnesses, including internal inconsistencies (that is, whether the testimony changed while on the stand or from that given at discovery), prior inconsistent statements, and external inconsistencies (that is, whether the evidence of the witness is inconsistent with independent evidence which has been accepted by me). Second, I can assess the attitude and demeanour of the witness. Third, I can assess whether the witness has a motive to fabricate evidence or to mislead the court. Finally, I can consider the overall sense of the evidence. That is, when common sense is applied to the testimony, does it suggest that the evidence is impossible or highly improbable.\n[42] In assessing the evidence adduced at trial, I can accept all, some or reject all of a witness testimony and I can also accept part of a witness evidence and reject other parts (see Ha v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 271, at para. 21).\n[43] According to the Respondent, Mr. He lacks credibility. Mr. He had motive to mislead the Court, as he does not want to pay the taxes at issue. Mr. He alleges that the income as reported was correct, but his explanations as to how he sustains his family of four in Toronto is based on large gifts received from his father-in-law, and loans received from friends and family members, but no documentary evidence was adduced in that respect. Further, there were inconsistencies and weaknesses in his testimony.\n[44] I agree with the Respondent. For the following reasons, I find that Mr. He\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged large gifts received from his father-in-law was not credible, and I totally reject that part of Mr. He\u2019s testimony. Among other things, there was no corroboration and no supporting documentation produced at trial; further, there were inconsistencies between his testimony at trial and his answers on discovery; and finally, the issues of the gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law were not raised at audit, or at the objection level, but only at trial.\n[45] According to Mr. He, he received approximately $30,000 as a gift from his father-in-law every year, and his spouse also received gifts from her father every year.\n[46] More particularly, Mr. He testified that he had received the following gifts from his father-in-law:\n-in 2009: $30,000, but according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings, he received $22,280 (see Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 13);\n-in 2010: $100,000 (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings \u2013 Exhibit R\u20114, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 15);\n-in 2011: Mr. He did not remember the exact amount received (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings, he would have received $47,536 \u2013 Exhibit R\u20114, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 15); and\n-in 2012: $68,000 (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings \u2013 Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 17).\n[47] Mr. He testified that it was his spouse who received the funds purported to be gifts from his father-in-law and deposited these amounts in one of their bank accounts. However, at the hearing, Mr. He was not able to show in which bank accounts these funds were deposited. Furthermore, Mr. He testified that the funds were not sent directly to his spouse by his father-in-law, who lives in China, because of transfer difficulties between China and Canada. He testified that some friends of his spouse\u2019s sister who live in Canada transferred the funds to his spouse. Then, his father-in-law reimbursed the families of these friends in China. Mr. He did not remember the names of any of these friends. Mr. He testified that gifts from his father-in-law were always delivered to him and his spouse in the same manner.\n[48] Mr. He testified that no formal documentation was prepared as these were transfers between family members.\n[49] At the hearing, the Respondent asked the Court to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call Mr. He\u2019s spouse to testify, because her testimony would have been central to establishing that gifts were received from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law over the years.\n[50] As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 FCA 79 [Imperial Pacific] (at para. 14), a Tax Court judge can draw an adverse inference from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness, especially if the witness\u2019s evidence would have been central to establishing an important fact.\n[51] In the case at bar, the testimony of Mr. He\u2019s spouse was central to establishing the existence of these large gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law, and particularly, in showing how funds were transferred from her father (indirectly through her sister\u2019s friends) to their bank accounts. I did not receive any explanation justifying Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s absence at trial. I find that I should draw an adverse inference from Mr. He\u2019s failure to call his spouse at the hearing, and I find that her testimony would have been unfavourable to Mr. He.\n[52] For all these reasons, no adjustments shall be made to the net worth calculations in respect of those alleged gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law.\n[53] Furthermore, I have significant concerns about Mr. He\u2019s testimony regarding various funds allegedly received as loans from friends and family. As indicated below, I accept that he had received some funds during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years as loans, but not to the extent that would justify the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[54] At audit and the CRA\u2019s appeal, Mr. He did not raise the fact that he had received specific funds as loans from friends and family. It was only on discovery and at trial that Mr. He raised these alleged specific loans from friends and family.\n[55] At audit and the CRA\u2019s appeal, Mr. He maintained that he participated in a traditional Chinese loan arrangement called \u201cFujian Arrangement\u201d (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20 - Letter from Mr. He\u2019s agent dated May 15, 2015, and addressed to the CRA auditor) and that would justify in part the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[56] However, Mr. He did not participate in a traditional Chinese lending program during the 2009 to 2012 period (Exhibit RA-1, Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, para. 127).\n[57] At trial, Mr. He testified that the reference to the Fujian Arrangement by his representative at the time of audit was just given as an example. Mr. He testified that he was not participating in such an arrangement during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. However, the letter from Mr. He\u2019s representative clearly states that \u201cMr. He participated in a number of these mutual lending groups\u201d, referring to the Fujian Arrangement (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20, p. 180) to justify the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[58] Again, I have significant concerns about Mr. He\u2019s evidence regarding the various funds he had received as loans, given the above-described inconsistencies and the justification changing at trial from what was advanced at audit and at CRA appeal.\n[59] For these reasons, only particular loans, as alleged by Mr. He, that were sufficiently supported through corroborating testimony at trial will be accepted to reduce Mr. He\u2019s unreported income as determined by the net worth assessment. These acceptable loans will be enumerated below. However, the acceptance of these particular loans do not justify the discrepancy between Mr. He\u2019s reported income and his net worth.\n(2) Reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period\n[60] The relevant portion of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) reads as follows:\n152(4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer . . . , except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return . . . .\n[61] As indicated above, the Minister has the onus to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the facts required to justify reassessing after the expiration of the normal reassessment period. The Minister must show to the Court, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He made a misrepresentation in filing his returns and that this misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Respondent did not raise fraud in this appeal.\n[62] In order to make a determination under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), the Court must assess all of the evidence admitted during the hearing (see Vine Estate v. Canada, 2015 FCA 125, at paras. 24\u201325).\n[63] The Appellant argues that if the Court is satisfied that Mr. He earned unreported income and did not give a credible explanation for the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth, then the Minister has met his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) (see Lacroix, at para. 32).\n[64] For the following reasons, I find that the Minister has discharged his burden to reassess Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years (see Lacroix, at para. 32). I find that all requirements in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) are met in the case at bar.\n[65] Firstly, Mr. He made a misrepresentation in filing his returns for 2009 to 2012. The case law holds that an incorrect statement in an income tax return amounts to a misrepresentation (Nesbitt v. The Queen, 96 D.T.C. 6045, [1996] F.C.J. No. 19 (F.C.T.D.) (QL); D\u2019Andrea v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 298, at para. 35).\n[66] Because I do not accept Mr. He\u2019s testimony on the alleged large gifts received from his father-in-law and on various alleged funds received as loans from friends and family (other than some loans as will be discussed below), and as I am drawing an adverse inference from the failure to call Mr. He\u2019s spouse to testify, I conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. He must have earned income he had not reported in filing his returns and hence made a misrepresentation in filing his returns.\n[67] I also conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He would not have had sufficient revenue to support a family of four living in Toronto during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. This conclusion reinforces my finding that Mr. He must have earned income he had not reported, which would explain the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[68] At first, in making his arguments, the Respondent referred only to Mr. He\u2019s reported net income for income tax purposes. However, at trial, I asked the Respondent to redo his calculations, as Mr. He would have had funds available to him from the sale of properties and from the renting of properties. Furthermore, I asked the Respondent to consider in his calculations other amounts received by Mr. He and his spouse during that time (for example, the amount received under the Canada Child Benefit). On that revised basis, considering capital contributions made to Seasons during those years, as well as expenses incurred on mortgages (capital and interests), tuition fees and rental expenses, Mr. He would have had very little to nominal revenue to sustain his family needs during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years.\n[69] Secondly, I have to determine whether that misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. For the following reasons, I find that the misrepresentation was attributable to wilful default.\n[70] According to the Appellant, when Mr. He reviewed his tax returns, he made sure to report all taxable income earned. Discrepancies in his net worth came from the borrowing of funds, gifts he received and proceeds from the sale of properties. The Appellant also took the position that Mr. He could not have wilfully made a misrepresentation when filing his returns, as he was a new immigrant to Canada at the time, having been in Canada for only five years in 2009. Furthermore, Mr. He did not speak the language and still needed interpretation at the hearing of this appeal. In addition, as Mr. He had carefully reviewed his tax returns, he could not be found to have been careless or neglectful.\n[71] According to the Respondent, the evidence showed that Mr. He had made a misrepresentation attributable to wilful default, or at the very least, he had made misrepresentation attributable to neglect or carelessness. Mr. He testified that he was aware of his obligations to accurately report his income under the Act. When asked the question, he testified that because of the language barrier, he simply signed his tax returns without reviewing them. However, when pressed, he testified that he had his accountant review the content of his tax returns and explain the numbers. According to the Respondent, these two answers cannot co-exist. Hence, that showed Mr. He was aware of the importance of accurately reporting income under the Act. Further, that conflicting testimony also undermines Mr. He\u2019s credibility.\n[72] I agree with the Respondent that the evidence showed that Mr. He had made a misrepresentation attributable to wilful default. Because Mr. He must have known he had unreported income and chose not to report it, he knew he was making a false statement in filing his income tax returns, and that was intentional.\n[73] Further, even if I were to accept all the Appellant\u2019s requested adjustments to the net worth calculations (which for the reasons below I do not), Mr. He would still have earned substantial unreported income totalling approximately $999,000 in the 2009 to 2012 taxation years.\n(3) Penalties\n[74] Subsection 163(2) provides that \u201c[e]very person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made . . . a false statement or omission in a return\u201d is liable to a penalty.\n[75] The burden of establishing the facts justifying the assessment of the penalty is on the Minister, under subsection 163(3).\n[76] The penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act must be imposed only where the evidence clearly justifies it. If the evidence leaves any doubt that the penalties should be applied in the circumstances of the appeal, then the only fair conclusion is that the taxpayer must receive the benefit of the doubt in those circumstances (see Farm Business Consultants Inc. v. The Queen, [1994] 2 C.T.C. 2450, 95 D.T.C. 200, at para. 27).\n[77] According to the very wording of subsection 163(2) of the Act, two elements are required for a penalty to apply: (1) a mental element (\u201cknowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d) and (2) a material element (\u201chas made . . . a false statement or omission in a return\u201d).\n[78] Regarding the material element, as indicated above, the case law holds that an incorrect statement in an income tax return amounts to a misrepresentation. Here, it was established that Mr. He filed his income tax returns for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Furthermore, it was established, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He did not report all of his income for all taxation years. Thus, the material element exists in the case at bar.\n[79] Regarding the mental element, two possible scenarios have to be examined for penalties to apply: did Mr. He knowingly make a false statement or omission, or did he make a false statement under circumstances amounting to gross negligence?\n[80] Here, as indicated above, I found that Mr. He had made a false statement in his returns by not reporting all of his income. Furthermore, I was not satisfied with his explanations justifying the discrepancy in his reported income and his net worth, as I found that some parts of his testimony were not credible.\n[81] Hence, Mr. He must have known he had a source of income he did not report and therefore knowingly filed incorrect returns.\n[82] As indicated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Deyab v. The Queen, 2020 FCA 222 (at para. 69, referring to Lacroix), the failure to provide a credible explanation is sufficient to justify the assessment of the penalty under subsection 163(2) of the Act.\n[83] Here, it is not appropriate to give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. He, as I did find that his explanations on the various gifts and loans, which would allegedly justify the discrepancy in his income and his net worth, were not credible. Having assessed all the evidence submitted at trial, I find that large amounts of income remain unexplained.\n[84] For the foregoing reasons, the penalties, as adjusted to take into account adjustments to the net worth calculations and the Respondent\u2019s concessions, shall be upheld.\nC. Adjustments to the net worth calculations\n[85] I will now turn to the adjustments the Appellant argued should be made to the net worth calculations.\n(1) Additional Assets (Schedule I \u2013 Balance Sheet \u2013 Asset) and corresponding adjustments\n[86] Mr. He testified that two properties were missing from the list established by the CRA during audit, namely, a small store located in Chinatown he was planning to open in 2005, called the \u201cSplendid China Square Property\u201d and a warehouse located at 20 Rolark Drive, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cWarehouse\u201d), purchased in 2012.\n[87] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, a deposit made by Mr. He for the purchase of a property located at 9 Fulham Street (the \u201cFulham Property\u201d) should be taken into account, and various adjustments should be made to the value of the shareholders\u2019 loan account of Seasons.\n\u00b7 Investment of $46,275 in the Splendid China Square Property\n[88] In 2005, Mr. He made a deposit totalling $46,275 to buy a commercial condominium in a development called Splendid China Square (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 262). Because the building was never built, the builder refunded the amount of the deposit to Mr. He and paid interest on deposit totalling $3,123.31 (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, pp. 260 and 261 for a copy of two cheques dated August 22, 2011: one for $46,275 and one for $3,123.31, totalling $49,398.31). These amounts were deposited in Mr. He\u2019s RBC bank account (#5699) in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 615). In August 2011, Mr. He and the builder entered into an agreement entitled \u201cMutual Release and Termination Agreement\u201d (see Exhibit A\u20111, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 258).\n[89] According to the Appellant, the deposit on Splendid China Square Property should be added, as an asset of $46,275, to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, an amount of $46,275 should be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2011.\n[90] I agree with the Appellant that the above adjustments to the net worth calculations in respect of the Splendid China Square Property shall be made.\n\u00b7 The Warehouse\n[91] Mr. He testified that the Warehouse was bought in 2012, with two partners (Mr. Guo Lin He and Mr. Kai Chen), each contributing 33% of the purchase price. Mr. He testified that the purchase was made through a corporation.\n[92] Mr. He further testified that he financed his contribution by borrowing money from Mr. Guo Lin He, roughly $100,000, but he did not remember specifics of the loan, such as how the funds were transferred, and there was no documentation associated with this loan. The Appellant produced Exhibit A-2, a money order of $101,919 from Mr. He to Kai Wing Tsang in trust, who was the lawyer who handle the purchase of the Warehouse.\n[93] According to the Appellant, as the loan from Mr. Guo Lin He to Mr. He for the purchase of the Warehouse was made in 2012, and the purchase of the Warehouse was also concluded in 2012, these transactions would have a neutral effect on the net worth calculations, and no adjustments will have to be made to the net worth calculations.\n[94] Accordingly, there will be no adjustments to the net worth calculations in respect of the Warehouse and the loan from Mr. Guo Lin He.\n\u00b7 Deposit of $20,000 for the purchase of the \u201cFulham Property\u201d\n[95] The Appellant produced a Purchase & Sale Agreement dated November 28, 2010, between Mr. He as purchaser and Adam Bholat as vendor in respect of the purchase of the Fulham Property (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 24, p. 279). By virtue of this agreement, Mr. He agreed to make a deposit totalling $20,000 by cheque made to \u201cMichal Hasek Real Estate Ltd. Brokerage\u201d in anticipation of the purchase of the Fulham Property. The statement of adjustments also refers to a deposit of $20,000 (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 24, p. 280).\n[96] The withdrawal analysis of the Royal Bank of Canada account (#5699) shows that two cheques went through the account on December 1, 2010 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, p. 108). Mr. Battiste testified that this amount was included in the personal expenditures calculations.\n[97] According to the Appellant, the deposit on the Fulham Property should be added as an asset of $20,000 to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in 2010. Furthermore, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same year.\n[98] I agree with the Appellant that the above adjustments to the net worth calculations shall be made.\n\u00b7 Shareholders\u2019 Loan Account in Seasons\n[99] Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) includes an asset consisting of the balance of the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons at the end of a given year, in the following amounts for the years 2009 to 2012 respectively: $74,975; $958,573; $943,426 and $1,096,456.\n[100] The evidence showed that the shareholders\u2019 loan account balance in Seasons was in the following amounts for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively: $299,900; $3,834,290; $3,813,705 and $4,385,822 (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tabs 26, 27, 30, 31, and 32).\n[101] Mr. He testified that around 2009, Mr. Shang Hui Zeng, Mr. Guo Lin He, Mr. Xun Gen Zheng and himself constituted Seasons in order to complete the purchase of an old market in Brampton and carry on the business of a new supermarket. Mr. He testified that he got involved in Seasons after his cousin, Mr. Guo Lin He, asked him to join in the venture. Mr. Guo Lin He had experience in that field and had immigrated to Canada before Mr. He. The supermarket opened on June 18, 2010.\n[102] According to Mr. He, the partners had estimated that they needed $4M to buy the former market, to renovate the building where the new supermarket would be located and to start operating the business, each partner being responsible for investing $1M in the capital of Seasons. The evidence is silent as to when the investment had to be made.\n[103] The evidence showed that Mr. He owns shares in Seasons, in the following proportion: 25% in 2009, 20% in 2010 and 2011 and 32% in 2012 (Exhibit RA\u20111, Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, Paras. 81 to 84).\n[104] Mr. He testified that although he had legal title to 25% of the shares, he owned a beneficial interest of only 8% and had invested approximately $320,000 in the capital of Seasons over the years. According to Mr. He, the balance of capital needed in Seasons was provided by his family (12% together by his spouse\u2019s sister and his brother and sister) as well as by an investor (5% by Mr. Zeng Min Fei).\n[105] As indicated by Mr. He, Mr. Guo Lin He also testified that each shareholder was responsible for contributing $1M to the capital of Seasons. According to Mr. Guo Lin He, the partners had to borrow from relatives and friends to assist with the financing. Mr. Xun Gen Zheng, one of Seasons\u2019 shareholders, was the person responsible for tracking the amounts contributed by each shareholder. In 2011, another person became a shareholder of Seasons, namely, Mr. Minfei Zheng.\n[106] As mentioned above, on appeal, Mr. Battiste concluded that it was reasonable to attribute only 25% of the balance of the shareholders\u2019 loan account to Mr. He and not the totality of it, as Mr. He owned 25% of the shares of Seasons. Consequently, Mr. Battiste reduced the value of that asset accordingly in the net worth calculations.\n[107] However, according to the Appellant, the shareholders\u2019 loan account balance attributable to Mr. He should be the aggregate of the funds actually transferred by Mr. He over the years to Seasons\u2019 bank account, and no more, as the net worth is a calculation of Mr. He\u2019s net worth. The ownership of shares in Seasons is not relevant, and only contributions of capital made by Mr. He over the years are relevant.\n[108] As argued by the Appellant, and conceded by the Respondent, I find that for the purposes of the net worth calculations, the percentage of shares owned by Mr. He is not a relevant factor, as the relevant amount to be included as an asset under the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons is the aggregate contributions of capital made by Mr. He to the capital of Seasons.\n[109] For that purpose, the Appellant asks the Court to count only the following transfers from Mr. He\u2019s accounts to Seasons\u2019 bank accounts as found by the CRA during audit. At audit, the CRA found that Mr. He had transferred funds totalling $360,050 from his bank accounts to Seasons\u2019 bank account during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 26), as follows:\n-in 2009: two transfers totalling $65,000 from his TD bank account (#0532);\n-in 2010: various transfers totalling $255,050 from his TD bank account (#0677), RBC bank account (#5699) and CIBC bank account (#6531);\n-in 2012: one transfer for $40,000 from his RBC bank account (#5699).\n[110] The CRA could not trace any transfers made by Mr. He to Seasons\u2019 bank account in 2011.\n[111] However, Mr. He never provided copies of any records or ledgers detailing the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons, although requested by the CRA, including Mr. Battiste.\n[112] Then, at trial, Mr. He did not provide any documentary evidence for the calculation of the shareholders\u2019 loan account. Furthermore, according to Mr. Guo Lin He\u2019s testimony, Mr. He never requested a copy of the shareholders\u2019 loan account ledger. In addition, Mr. Xun Gen Zheng, the shareholder responsible for keeping track of funds invested by Seasons\u2019 shareholders, did not testify at the hearing.\n[113] I find that Mr. He should have been able to provide the Court with documentary evidence to support his position. I find that Mr. He should have produced documentary evidence showing the capital contributions he had made over the years to the capital of Seasons. I cannot conclude that the CRA, in the course of the audit, was able to determine all capital contributions made by Mr. He to the capital of Seasons, given that Mr. He never provided any documents to the CRA in the course of the audit in respect of his capital contributions.\n[114] Also, Mr. He should have called Mr. Xun Gen Zheng to testify. I agree with the Respondent that I should draw a negative inference from the failure by Mr. He to call Mr. Zheng to testify at the hearing (see Imperial Pacific, supra, at para. 14). I find that Mr. Zheng\u2019s testimony would not have been favourable to Mr. He\u2019s position.\n[115] Given the lack of credible and reliable evidence adduced at the hearing and the negative inference drawn from the failure to call Mr. Zheng to testify, I find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in respect of the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons.\n(2) Additional liabilities (Schedule II \u2013 Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) and corresponding adjustments\n[116] Mr. He claimed that he had received funds as loans from various persons. At trial, Mr. He was unable to provide any loan documentation, as he testified personal loans were never documented because they were transactions with friends and family. However, for some of the alleged loans, Mr. He was able to produce evidence in the form of cheques or other documents. Furthermore, witnesses testified in respect of some of the loans. In those circumstances, where the provided evidence was credible and reliable, I did find that adjustments had to be made to the net worth calculations to take into account these operations.\n\u00b7 Loan from Banxin Chen\n[117] Mr. He testified that in 2009, he received an amount of $28,000 from a friend, Mr. Banxin Chen, in order to help him make capital contributions to Seasons.\n[118] Mr. He produced in evidence a cheque made out to him by Ocean Linksys Inc., a corporation owned by Mr. Chen, for $28,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 11). Mr. He testified that his father-in-law reimbursed Mr. Chen\u2019s father in China.\n[119] Mr. He was unable to provide any loan documentation. Further, Mr. He was not able to say in which bank account those funds were deposited, but the evidence showed that these funds were deposited in Mr. He\u2019s bank account at RBC (#5699) (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 610).\n[120] According to the Appellant, Ocean Linksys Inc. had no reason to write Mr. He a cheque, other than to make a loan to him. Further, according to the Appellant, in 2009, it would have been reasonable for Mr. He to reach out to friends and family in order to capitalize Seasons. For these reasons, according to the Appellant, an amount of $28,000 should be added as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2009 to 2012.\n[121] The Appellant did not satisfy me, on a balance of probabilities, that the amount of $28,000 should be added as a liability for 2009 to 2012. The evidence is not clear as to when or if the amount of $28,000 was ever repaid. Mr. He testified that his father-in-law reimbursed Mr. Chen\u2019s father in China, without providing any details in that respect. Further, Mr. He did not refer to that loan in his answers to undertakings (Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read Ins, page 13). Given the lack of evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that Mr. He did not meet his burden to show that his position should prevail. I therefore find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in that respect.\n\u00b7 Loan from Xue Yu Chen\n[122] Mr. He testified that he had borrowed $80,000 from Mr. Chen in 2008 or before. According to Mr. He, these funds were deposited in one of his bank accounts, but he could not say in which account.\n[123] Mr. He adduced into evidence two cheques he wrote to Mr. Chen: one cheque dated August 5, 2010, for $20,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 12, p. 265) and one cheque dated May 2, 2011, for $60,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 13, p. 266). Mr. He testified that these cheques were issued in repayment of the loan.\n[124] Mr. Battiste testified that the amounts of $60,000 and $20,000 were added to the personal expenditures calculation on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in 2011 and 2010, respectively (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 133 and Tab 15, p. 108).\n[125] According to the Appellant, a liability of $80,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2008 and 2009. As partial repayment was made in 2010, the liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) should be in the amount of $60,000 instead of $80,000 in 2010. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000 in 2010.\n[126] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, as the final repayment of the loan was made in 2011, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan in 2011. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $60,000 in 2011.\n[127] Since credible documentary evidence was adduced at trial to establish the existence of a loan and the repayment of it, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Loan from Lan Lin\n[128] Mr. He testified that he had received a loan for $10,000 from Mr. Lan Lin, a friend of his spouse, in 2010. However, at trial, Mr. He was unable to provide any particulars in respect of that loan. No loan documentation was produced at the hearing. According to Mr. He, that amount was deposited in a bank account, but Mr. He was not able to indicate in which bank account the sum was deposited.\n[129] Mr. He testified that on May 5, 2011, he issued a cheque to Mr. Lin in the amount of $10,000 (see a copy of the cheque in Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 14, p. 267) in repayment of the loan.\n[130] Mr. Battiste testified that this amount was added to the calculation of personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 133).\n[131] According to the Appellant, a liability of $10,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2010. In 2011, as the final repayment of the loan was made, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $10,000 in 2011.\n[132] I find that as that alleged loan was linked to Mr. He\u2019s spouse, Mr. He should have called his spouse to testify. Because of Mr. He\u2019s failure to call his spouse to testify, I find that her testimony would have been unfavourable to Mr. He\u2019s position (see Imperial Pacific, supra, at para. 14). I also find that Mr. He\u2019s testimony was not persuasive. For these reasons, I find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in that respect.\n\u00b7 Loan from Guo Lin He (in 2010)\n[133] Both Mr. Guo Lin He and Mr. He testified that Mr. Guo Lin He lent Mr. He a sum of $12,000 around 2009 or 2010. No loan documentation was provided at the hearing. Similar to Mr. He\u2019s testimony, Mr. Guo Lin He testified that since this loan was between family members, they did not prepare any loan documentation, and the money was loaned without interest.\n[134] Mr. He was unable to provide any particulars relating to the original loan, such as when exactly or how it was made.\n[135] A copy of a cheque for $12,000 dated March 7, 2011, issued by Mr. He to his cousin, Mr. Guo Lin He, was adduced at the hearing (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, p. 268). Mr. He testified that the cheque was issued to repay the loan.\n[136] According to the Appellant, a liability for $12,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2010. In 2011, as the final repayment of the loan was made, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan. Furthermore, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $12,000 in 2011, with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth).\n[137] Since Mr. He\u2019s testimony was largely corroborated by his cousin\u2019s testimony, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Loans from Biao Yang (or Bill Yang)\n[138] Mr. He testified that in 2011, he had received an amount of $15,300 as a loan from a friend, Mr. Yang, who is a real estate agent (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p. 270: cheque dated February 25, 2011). In that same year, the evidence showed that Mr. He made a cheque to Mr. Yang for $10,000 (Exhibit A-3, cheque dated June 28, 2011). Mr. He testified that the cheque was issued in partial repayment of the loan.\n[139] At the hearing, the Respondent agreed that the amount of $10,000 was added to the personal expenditures calculation. Mr. Battiste testified it was so included in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 134).\n[140] According to the Appellant, in 2011 and 2012, the net result would be to add in Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) a liability in the net amount of $5,300 and to reduce the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in the amount of $10,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2011.\n[141] Furthermore, Mr. He testified that in 2012, he had received an amount of $20,000 as an additional loan from Mr. Yang (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 18, p. 271: cheque dated February 28, 2012). In that same year, Mr. He made a cheque to Mr. Yang for the same amount (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p.272: cheque dated May 23, 2012).\n[142] Mr. Battiste testified that the amount of $20,000 was added to the personal expenditures calculation for 2012 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p. 158).\n[143] According to the Appellant, no amount should be added to the liability section in Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2012, as the loan and the repayment were made within the same year. However, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth).\n[144] I agree with the Appellant\u2019s position. Since credible documentary evidence was adduced at trial to establish the existence of the loans and the repayment of the loans, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n(3) Additional adjustments to the calculation of personal expenditures (Schedule IV)\n\u00b7 Transfer to Fei Chen totalling $35,000\n[145] The evidence showed that Mr. He wrote two cheques to Mr. Chen, his nephew, in 2011:\n-a cheque dated January 10, 2011, for $18,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20, p. 274); and\n-a cheque dated January 10, 2011, for $17,000 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 53, p. 995).\n[146] Mr. Battiste testified that these amounts were included in the calculation of personal expenditures for 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, pp. 129 and 133) in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures).\n[147] Mr. He testified that he issued those two cheques totalling $35,000 to his nephew to assist him in purchasing a house. According to the Appellant, Mr. He acted as a conduit as Mr. Chen\u2019s family in China reimbursed his father-in-law in China.\n[148] Mr. Chen testified that his parents, who lived in China, arranged everything with his uncle, so Mr. He would transfer money to Mr. Chen to assist him in purchasing a house. Mr. Chen testified that his parents transferred funds to a person in China; in return, someone in Canada gave money to Mr. He so Mr. He would transfer funds to him. It was faster to proceed this way, and fees were less than if money was transferred directly from China.\n[149] According to the Appellant, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV \u2013(Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $35,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2011.\n[150] Although the testimony of both Mr. He and Mr. Chen was unclear, given the documentary evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Money order for $153,000 to Hui Ming Shi\n[151] Mr. He testified that he ordered his bank to issue a bank draft for $153,000 to Mr. Shi, his brother-in-law, in July 2009 (see the bank draft under Exhibit A\u20111, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 23). The bank draft was endorsed by Mr. Shi and is stamped July 15, 2009. Mr. He testified that this amount was likely a loan repayment. However, Mr. He testified that he was not able to provide any specific information and was uncertain of the nature of this amount, stating that his spouse may have been responsible for this amount.\n[152] However, at discovery, Mr. He stated that his father-in-law had him transfer that amount to his son in order to equalize money he had previously given to both his son and daughter (Answer to undertaking 8(b), Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Reads-In, p. 92).\n[153] At the hearing, Mr. Shi testified that the amount represented a loan from his brother-in-law to assist him in the purchase of a house. There were no repayment terms, nor was any loan documentation prepared in that respect. According to Mr. Shi\u2019s testimony, his father would take care of repaying that amount to Mr. He on his behalf. Mr. Shi never followed up with his father as to whether that amount had been reimbursed to Mr. He.\n[154] Further, Mr. Shi testified that there were no business dealings between him and his uncle.\n[155] The amount of the bank draft for $153,000 was considered a cash withdrawal by the CRA auditor and was included in the calculation of the personal expenditures for 2009 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 609) in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures).\n[156] According to the Appellant, the amount of $153,000 should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures as either Mr. He was acting as a conduit to bring money from his father-in-law into Canada or that amount represents the repayment of a loan. In both cases, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $153,000, with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009.\n[157] For the following reasons, no adjustments will be made to the net worth calculations in respect of the bank draft. Mr. Shi and Mr. He gave conflicting testimonies on the nature of this transfer. Furthermore, Mr. He gave inconsistent statements during discovery regarding the nature of that same transfer. Owing to the conflicting testimonies, the Appellant did not satisfy me, on a balance of probabilities, that this amount should reduce the personal expenditures calculations.\n\u00b7 Payments totalling $3,033 made by Mr. He to Budget Rent-A-Car in 2010\n[158] The evidence showed that between July 2010 and December 2010, Mr. He rented a truck at the Budget Rent-A-Car branch located in Brampton and incurred expenses totalling $3,033 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 19, p. 273, and Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, pp. 100 and 101; Tab 62, pp.1362, 1365, 1370, 1373, 1379 and 1383).\n[159] At the hearing, the Respondent stated that that amount was included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s personal expenditures for 2010 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, pp. 100\u2013101).\n[160] Mr. He testified that he was involved in the supermarket\u2019s management and was responsible for the frozen goods and dairy products. His partners were involved in other areas of the supermarket (vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, grocery, etc.). Being responsible for the dairy products and frozen goods, Mr. He had to visit suppliers, order goods, price them and organize shelves.\n[161] Mr. He testified that as Seasons had only one truck available for its business, he often had to rent a truck from Budget Rent-A-Car in Brampton to be able to visit suppliers and pick up and transport goods to the supermarket. He would pay these expenses with his VISA credit card (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 62, for the VISA credit card statements).\n[162] According to the Appellant, these amounts represent business expenses and should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures of Mr. He.\n[163] According to the Respondent, the evidence adduced at the hearing is not reliable, as Mr. He testified he had receipts from Seasons for these expenses but did not produce them at the hearing.\n[164] For the following reasons, I find Mr. He\u2019s evidence to be reliable and credible. Firstly, the truck was rented every week, in a constant manner. Also, the truck was rented from a Budget Rent-A-Car branch located in Brampton, near the supermarket, and not on the other side of Toronto in Scarborough, where Mr. He lives. Further, no amounts were expended before the supermarket opened in June of 2010.\n[165] Therefore, it is more likely than not these expenses are business expenses and not personal expenses for Mr. He. Accordingly, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) shall be reduced by an amount of $3,033 in 2010, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same year.\n\u00b7 Payments made by Mr. He to Costco totalling $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012\n[166] The evidence showed that Mr. He incurred expenses on his Costco AMEX credit card totalling $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012 at a Costco branch located in Brampton.\n[167] At the hearing, the Respondent stated that that amount was included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s personal expenditures for 2011 and 2012 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 127; Tab 17, pp.151\u2013152). The Costco AMEX credit card statements were adduced under Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 65.\n[168] Mr. He testified that he would personally go to Costco to buy products for resale at the supermarket, because prices at Costco were often lower than those offered by his own suppliers. At Costco, Mr. He would pay with his personal AMEX Costco credit card, as Seasons was not in a financial position to have credit cards for its shareholders, being a newly incorporated corporation.\n[169] Mr. He would most of time go to the Costco store located in Brampton, which is close to the supermarket. Mr. He testified that the Costco purchases were actually purchases of goods for the supermarket and not for his personal use.\n[170] According to the Appellant, these amounts represent business expenses and should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures of Mr. He.\n[171] According to the Respondent, the evidence adduced at the hearing is not reliable, as Mr. He testified he had receipts from Seasons for these expenses but did not produce them at hearing.\n[172] For the following reasons, I find Mr. He\u2019s evidence to be reliable and credible. Firstly, I note that no amounts were expended in that respect before the supermarket was opened. Further, the expenses were incurred in Brampton, where the supermarket is located, and not in Scarborough, where Mr. He lives.\n[173] Therefore, it is more likely than not that these expenses are business expenses and not personal expenses. Accordingly, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) shall be reduced by an amount of $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same years.\n(4) Additional adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)\n\u00b7 Cheque for $4,269.95 issued by the Government of Canada in 2009\n[174] Evidence showed that Mr. He received a cheque for $4,269.95 from the Government of Canada in August 2009 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 53, p. 885). The cheque was deposited in Mr. He\u2019s CIBC account (#6151) (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 22, p. 277).\n[175] The cheque seems to be a GST rebate payment made by the Government of Canada to Mr. He in respect of the Telegram Mews Property. Upon the sale of the Telegram Mews Property, that amount was included in the calculation of outlays and expenses (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 46).\n[176] According to the Appellant, that amount should be considered an additional deduction on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009. However, the Respondent argued that since that amount had reduced the capital gains on the sale of Telegram Mews Property, it should not be taken into account as a deduction.\n[177] I agree with the Appellant. The amount of $4,269.95 is a refund received by Mr. He and shall be taken into account as an additional deduction on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J.\nSchedule A\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 21\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-4775(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nYu Xing He v.

Introduction\n[1] There is no disagreement concerning the facts. There is no disagreement concerning the figures.\n[2] In 2008, the appellant purchased a duplex in Montreal.\n[3] He occupied the lower unit as his principal residence and he rented out the upper unit to other people.\n[4] In 2017, the appellant stopped renting out the upper unit. He did some renovations in order to transform the duplex into a single-family residence.\n[5] After the changes were made, the appellant used the single-family residence as his principal residence. There was therefore a change of use in 2017.\n[6] The transformation in 2017 triggered a deemed disposition resulting from the change of partial use, and therefore a capital gain and a taxable capital gain.\n[7] In June 2018, the appellant filed his tax return for the 2017 taxation year, in which he declared a capital gain in connection with the change of use and did not ask that the capital gain be deferred under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\n[8] The Minister\u2019s initial assessment accepted the appellant\u2019s tax return as filed.\n[9] On November 13, 2018, the appellant served a notice of objection in order to make his election under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\n[10] The Minister confirmed the initial assessment.\n[11] The appellant argued that under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, he was entitled to elect to defer the capital gain.\n[12] The respondent made the opposite argument. In the respondent\u2019s submission, the election was available only if there was a change of use of the entire property, the duplex.\n[13] Amendments were made to subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act that came into force after March 18, 2019.\n[14] At the end of 2017, subsection 45(3) read as follows:\n(3) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[15] At present, paragraph 45(3) reads as follows:\n(3) If at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income, or that was acquired in part for that purpose, ceases in whole or in part to be used for that purpose and becomes, or becomes part of, the principal residence of the taxpayer, paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[16] If the change of use had taken place after March 18, 2019, there would be no doubt that the appellant could have deferred the capital gain.\n[17] One consequence of the interpretation by the Canada Revenue Agency is that the taxpayer must pay the tax despite the fact that he did not sell the property, and in his financial circumstances, this could cause him cash flow problems. While that may be so, a cash flow problem can arise in various situations in which the Act creates a deemed disposition.\n[18] This is a somewhat surprising outcome, given that an individual who rents out a house that he owns and changes the use of the house to make it his principal residence may make the election and avoid it triggering a deemed disposition.[1]\nII. Analysis[2]\n[19] No conclusions may be drawn regarding the prior rights from the fact that the Act was amended with effect as of March 18, 2019.[3]\n[20] It is agreed that provisions must be interpreted using a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole.[4]\n[21] In interpreting subsection 45(3), it is important to consider the text of section 45 of the Income Tax Act, as it read at the end of 2017, as a whole:\nProperty with more than one use\n45 (1) For the purposes of this subdivision the following rules apply:\n(a) where a taxpayer,\n(i) having acquired property for some other purpose, has commenced at a later time to use it for the purpose of gaining or producing income, or\n(ii) having acquired property for the purpose of gaining or producing income, has commenced at a later time to use it for some other purpose,\nthe taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(iii) disposed of it at that later time for proceeds equal to its fair market value at that later time, and\n(iv) immediately thereafter reacquired it at a cost equal to that fair market value;\n(b) where property has, since it was acquired by a taxpayer, been regularly used in part for the purpose of gaining or producing income and in part for some other purpose, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired, for that other purpose, the proportion of the property that the use regularly made of the property for that other purpose is of the whole use regularly made of the property at a cost to the taxpayer equal to the same proportion of the cost to the taxpayer of the whole property, and, if the property has, in such a case, been disposed of, the proceeds of disposition of the proportion of the property deemed to have been acquired for that other purpose shall be deemed to be the same proportion of the proceeds of disposition of the whole property;\n(c) where, at any time after a taxpayer has acquired property, there has been a change in the relation between the use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for gaining or producing income and the use regularly made of the property for other purposes,\n(i) if the use regularly made of the property for those other purposes has increased, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(A) disposed of the property at that time for proceeds equal to the proportion of the fair market value of the property at that time that the amount of the increase in the use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for those other purposes is of the whole use regularly made of the property, and\n(B) immediately thereafter reacquired the property so disposed of at a cost equal to the proceeds referred to in clause 45(1)(c)(i)(A), and\n(ii) if the use regularly made of the property for those other purposes has decreased, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(A) disposed of the property at that time for proceeds equal to the proportion of the fair market value of the property at that time that the amount of the decrease in use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for those other purposes is of the whole use regularly made of the property, and\n(B) immediately thereafter reacquired the property so disposed of at a cost equal to the proceeds referred to in clause 45(1)(c)(ii)(A); and\n(d) in applying this subsection in respect of a non-resident taxpayer, a reference to \u201cgaining or producing income\u201d shall be read as a reference to \u201cgaining or producing income from a source in Canada\u201d.\nElection where change of use\n(2) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\nElection concerning principal residence\n(3) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\nWhere election cannot be made\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection 45(3), an election described in that subsection shall be deemed not to have been made in respect of a change in use of property if any deduction in respect of the property has been allowed for any taxation year ending after 1984 and on or before the change in use under regulations made under paragraph 20(1)(a) to the taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a trust under which the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner is a beneficiary.\n[22] Subsection 45(1) contains general rules that apply to changes in the use of a property, from use for the purpose of gaining or producing income to use for some other purpose, and vice versa.\n[23] Paragraph 45(1)(a) applies when a property that is acquired for a single purpose is subsequently used solely for the other purpose. The paragraph deems a disposition.\n[24] Paragraph 45(1)(b) applies when the property is to be used for both purposes at the time of the acquisition. This paragraph operates to divide the cost of acquisition between the two purposes.\n[25] Paragraph 45(1)(c) deems a disposition when there is a change in the percentage of the use of the property for each purpose.[5]\n[26] Subsections 45(2) and (3) allow a taxpayer to defer deemed dispositions in certain circumstances. Subsection 45(2) is not relevant in this case.\n[27] The key question could be summarized as follows. Must the phrase:\na property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose\nbe understood as if it read:\na property that was acquired by a taxpayer exclusively for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose?\n[28] I can understand how the phrase \u201ca property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose\u201d could be read, at first glance, as applying only in circumstances in which the property was acquired exclusively for the purpose of gaining or producing income, that is, the situation described in subparagraph 45(1)(a)(ii).\n[29] For one thing, the fact that paragraphs 45(1)(a) and (c) deal separately with changes from one single purpose to the other single purpose and with changes in the proportion of use for each purpose, respectively, could suggest that Parliament had planned to address these two situations separately within subsection 45(3) if its intention was to allow the election in subsection 45(3) in both situations.\n[30] Having regard to the general scheme of section 45, I am satisfied, for the following reasons, that subsection 45(3) of the Act also applies in the fact situation in this appeal.\n[31] First, while it was necessary to separate subsections 45(1)(a) and (c) since the consequences of the two types of deemed dispositions, in terms of their effects, are different, no such separation was necessary in drafting subsection 45(3), because the consequence is simply to defer the disposition in both cases.\n[32] I note that subsection 45(3) is not limited to paragraph 45(1)(a); that subsection contains the phrase \u201csubsection 45(1) shall not apply...\u201d.\n[33] Second, the objective of subsection 45(3) when it was added in 1985 was to allow deemed dispositions of a residential property to be deferred when the property became a principal residence and subsection 45(4) did not apply.[6]\n[34] Although the technical notes talk about a residential property, there is nothing to suggest that the amendments were intended to exclude conversion of part of the property, for example half of a duplex.\n[35] An interpretation that excludes a partial change of use is contrary to the objective intended when subsection 45(3) was added.[7]\n[36] Third, I do not see how it could be said that once the taxpayer ceased to rent out the upper part of the property he did not cease to use the property for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The taxpayer is no longer receiving a penny of income.\n[37] The appeal is therefore allowed, without costs, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the appellant was entitled to make the election and defer the capital gain under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 20th day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

The courts may consider those administrative positions.\nThe respondent\u2019s representative produced various documents in the course of his submissions; while these are not evidence, to facilitate identification of the documents they were identified as A\u20111 to A\u201114.\nAt one time, the CRA took the administrative position that the election could be made in circumstances such as those in issue here. However, the CRA changed its position well before 2017. The ARQ seems to be of the contrary opinion; however, the ARQ seems to have followed the CRA under the provisions relating to \u201crelated elections\u201d. See the last page of Exhibit A\u20115.\n[3] See section 45 of the Interpretation Act and paragraph 86 of Canada v. Oxford Properties Group 2018 FCA 30 (CanLII).\n[4] See, for example, Minister of National Revenue v. Al Saunders Contracting & Consulting Inc. 2020 FCA 89 at paragraph 20 or Canada v. BCS Group Business Services Inc., 2020 FCA (CanLII) at paragraph 21, in which the Federal Court of Appeal summarizes the principles of interpretation as follows:\nThe modern approach to statutory interpretation is well established. The words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object and the intention of Parliament. This means that one must read the text, taking into account the purpose of the Act and of the provision at issue and all relevant context, including established common law and civil law concepts unless these are clearly ousted by legislation.\n[5] Paragraph 45(1)(d) is of no relevance in this case.\n[6] See the technical notes dated September 9, 1985, provided by the Minister of Finance. It is agreed that the Court may consider technical notes: Silicon Graphics Ltd v. R., 2002 FCA 260.\n[7] As well, in the context of section 45, the ordinary meaning of property acquired \u201cfor the purpose of gaining or producing income\u201d does not exclude property acquired in part for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n",

TRIPLETT,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nJorr\u00e9 J.\n[1] The circumstances surrounding this appeal are extremely unfortunate. At the end of these reasons, I will make some comments about these circumstances and I would urge the parties to carefully consider them.\n[2] I would also suggest policy makers seriously consider the possibility of amendments regarding when elections must be made under section 217 of the Income Tax Act.\n[3] The Appellant appeals from non-resident withholding tax assessments dated 26 February 2018 with respect to the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years.\n[4] The Appellant is a retired teacher who resided in Canada until 11 October 2011. He moved to the United States and became a non-resident of Canada.\n[5] In May and June 2016, respectively, the Minister of National revenue wrote to the Appellant regarding unfiled T1 returns for the years 2011 to 2014 inclusive.\n[6] The Minister first became aware of the Appellant\u2019s change in residency in June 2016.\n[7] In July 2016 the Appellant filed T1 tax returns for all the years in issue and he filed them in the same way as if he had still been a resident. His income consisted of superannuation benefits and in the 2015 taxation year only some RRSP income.\n[8] In March 2017 the Minister assessed the five taxation years as filed. Those assessments resulted in no tax owing. Presumably, this was because the tax withheld by the payors of the pension and of the RRSP payments together with personal credits resulted in no tax payable.\n[9] In February 2018, the Minister issued failure to remit assessments for Part XIII non-resident withholding tax with respect to the five years in issue.\n[10] The amounts assessed are in the right-hand column of the table at paragraph 18 of the affidavit of Elaine Armstrong-Kyne.\n[11] As can be seen from the table, those amounts have been computed in each year by determining the applicable non-resident withholding tax[1] on the payments in the year and deducting therefrom the amounts that were withheld at source. I will refer to those amounts withheld as the additional withholding amounts.\n[12] The Appellant duly objected to these assessments and the Minister subsequently confirmed them except in the case of the 2011 tax year.\n[13] In the 2011 tax year, the Minister accepted that the taxpayer had resided in Canada until October and recomputed the withholding tax amounts accordingly. This was to the taxpayer\u2019s benefit insofar as the 2011 non-resident withholding tax had originally been computed for the entire year.\n[14] Nothing in the evidence has convinced me that there was any error by the Minister in the computation of the tax.\n[15] The purpose of section 217 of the Income Tax Act is to put certain non-resident individuals in a position where they are generally no worse off than if they were still residents.\n[16] Given the Appellant\u2019s income sources, had he made a timely election to benefit from the alternative provided for in section 217 of the Income Tax Act, he would have avoided having to pay the additional withholding amounts levied. This result stems from the fact that, generally, this alternative allows a taxpayer to keep the usual deductions.\n[17] Section 217 is optional because for some non-resident taxpayers, given their circumstances, it would be disadvantages for them to choose the alternative.\n[18] Unfortunately, section 217 required that the Appellant file a Part I tax return within six months of the end of the year and elect in that return to have section 217 apply for the tax year.[2]\n[19] That means that the Appellant would have had to file his return and make an election in respect of the last of the years in issue, 2015, on or before 30 June 2016.\n[20] Given that the returns for all of the years in issue were filed on 20 July 2016, it was by then already too late to make an election under section 217.\n[21] The result is that the assessments for the years are correct in fact and law and there is no basis for overturning the assessments.\n[22] I now turn to evidence that the Appellant gave in relation to the many difficulties that he had in obtaining information on how to proceed together with arguments he raised based on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n[23] I accept the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he had great difficulties in obtaining information, that there were delays and that the information was not always helpful.\n[24] However, notwithstanding its name, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is not a law and does not give rise to legal rights. It is more in the nature of an aspirational document and it would probably be better if the document were given a different name.\n[25] This court is one of limited jurisdiction and the essence of its jurisdiction is to determine whether assessments are correct based on the facts relevant to the applicable law; it can confirm or modify assessments but its decision cannot take account of other factors.\n[26] The consequence is that all the Appellant\u2019s difficulties are not relevant to the decision I must make.\n[27] The Appellant also testified as to the serious hardship that the assessments in question have caused for him and for his spouse.\n[28] While the Appellant appears to be in an extremely difficult situation given the amount owing in relation to his income, it is not something that I can consider for the purposes of the determination that I must make.\n[29] However, with respect to hardship, there are provisions which allow the Minister to waive interest and penalties in certain circumstances\u2014see subsection 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act. I am pleased to note that the Minister proactively waived interest for a certain period because of delays that took place earlier.\n[30] The Appellant can certainly make a request to the CRA for further relief under that provision. This court has no jurisdiction with respect to such matters.[3]\n[31] There is, however, a 10-year restriction; requests must be made within 10 calendar years after the taxation year. The Appellant can obtain more information regarding how the Minister approaches such requests by obtaining from the CRA Information Circular 07-1R 1\u2014Taxpayer Relief Provisions; there is also a related form RC 4288\u2014Request for taxpayer relief.\n[32] Before concluding, I wish to observe that, given the objectives of section 217, it is surprising that there is no possibility of electing section 217 any later than June 30 of the following calendar year.\n[33] The Appellant fits very well into the profile of the kind of taxpayer whom section 217 was intended to benefit.\n[34] In this case losing the ability to make such an election had a dramatic negative effect on the Appellant.\n[35] The withholdings already made by the payors of the Appellant\u2019s pension payments and RRSP payment were sufficient to cover all the Appellant\u2019s income tax had he been able to take advantage of section 217. At no time would the public purse have been out of pocket.\n[36] Given that, I find it hard to imagine what harm there might be if there were some way to extend the time to elect section 217 in circumstances such as those of this Appellant.[4]\n[37] The relatively short limit is also surprising given that, generally, an individual who fails to claim something could do so by filing an objection. Such an individual always has until at least one year after the filing due date.[5]\n[38] It is also surprising, given that for many things a taxpayer has the possibility of persuading the Minister to exercise the Minister\u2019s discretion to reassess, with the consent of the taxpayer, for a ten-year period.[6]\n[39] Policymakers and Parliament may wish to consider whether there should be amendments to give a longer period for making an election under section 217 or whether the Minister should have the ability to extend the time.[7]\n[40] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 22nd day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

This was raised as an issue in Mr. Ferri\u2019s Notice of Appeal. His testimony was that he took no active steps to prevent the company\u2019s failure to remit. There wasn\u2019t even evidence that in 1997 to 1999, when he admits to having been a director, systems were in place to ensure regular reporting to the board that all remittances were made when due and continued to be up to date.\n[4] In this appeal the appellant has the burden of proof to satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that the answer to at least one of the two questions above absolve him from director\u2019s liability under section 227.1.\nI. The Relevant Jurisprudence [5] The purpose of the directors\u2019 liability provisions of Canadian tax legislation has been described in Deakin 2012 TCC 270 as:\n[13] An employer is generally required by law to remit to the CRA the source deductions it has withheld from its employees\u2019 salaries and wages for income tax, CPP and EI deductions. This obligation differs from the employer\u2019s liability for its own taxes on its income. These amounts were withheld from the employees to be remitted to CRA and CRA, and hence Canadian taxpayers at large, give the employees credit for these amounts against the employees\u2019 tax liabilities. For this reason, the legislation gives CRA greater collection powers for such unremitted amounts than for the employer\u2019s own income taxes.\n[14] Similarly, a business is generally required to remit the amount of GST it collected from its customers, net of the GST the business paid on its purchases, supplies and inputs. The GST was collected by the business from its customers to be remitted to the CRA to satisfy the customers\u2019 GST liabilities. Again, recognizing this, the legislation gives CRA greater collection powers for such unremitted GST amounts.\n[15] Subsection 227.1 of the ITA and subsection 323 of the ETA provide that the directors of a corporation will be personally liable for a corporation\u2019s failure to remit employee withholdings and GST as required by law. Directors are not generally liable for a corporation\u2019s own income tax. The potential liability of directors reflects the degree of management and control directors have over a corporation\u2019s management and its affairs.\n[16] Subsections 227.1(3) of the ITA and 323(3) of the ETA each provide that a director will not be liable for the corporation\u2019s failure to remit such amounts as required by law if the director exercised a degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances.\n[17] The Federal Court of Appeal most recently had the occasion to consider the due diligence defence of directors for unremitted source deductions and GST in Her Majesty the Queen v. Buckingham, 2011 FCA 142. In that case, the Court wrote:\n\u2026\n[33] On the other hand, subsection 227.1(1) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act specifically provide that the directors \"are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable, together with the corporation, to pay the amount and any interest or penalties relating to\" the remittances the corporation is required to make. Subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act do not set out a general duty of care, but rather provide for a defence to the specific liability set out in subsections 227.1(1) and 323(1) of these respective Acts, and the burden is on the directors to prove that the conditions required to successfully plead such a defence have been met. The duty of care in subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act also specifically targets the prevention of the failure by the corporation to remit identified tax withholdings, including notably employee source deductions. Subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act has a similarly focus. The directors must thus establish that they exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill required \"to prevent the failure\". The focus of these provisions is clearly on the prevention of failures to remit.\n\u2026\n[40] The focus of the inquiry under subsections 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act will however be different than that under 122(1)(b) of the CBCA, since the former require that the director's duty of care, diligence and skill be exercised to prevent failures to remit. In order to rely on these defences, a director must thus establish that he turned his attention to the required remittances and that he exercised his duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts.\n\u2026\n[49] The traditional approach has been that a director's duty is to prevent the failure to remit, not to condone it in the hope that matters can be rectified subsequently: Canada v. Corsano, 1999 CanLII 9297 (FCA), [1999] 3 F.C. 173 (C.A.) at para. 35, Ruffo v. Canada, 2000 CanLII 15199 (FCA), 2000 D.T.C. 6317, [2000] 4 C.T.C. 39 (F.C.A.). Contrary to the suppliers of a corporation who may limit their financial exposure by requiring cash-in-advance payments, the Crown is an involuntary creditor. The level of the Crown's exposure to the corporation can thus increase if the corporation continues its operations by paying the net salaries of the employees without effecting employee source deductions remittances, or if the corporation decides to collect GST\/HST from customers without reporting and remitting these amounts in a timely fashion. In circumstances where a corporation is facing financial difficulties, it may be tempting to divert these Crown remittances in order to pay other creditors and thus ensure the continuation of the operations of the corporation. It is precisely such a situation which both section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act and section 323 of the Excise Tax Act seek to avoid. The defence under subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and under subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act should not be used to encourage such failures by allowing a due diligence defence for directors who finance the activities of their corporation with Crown monies on the expectation that the failures to remit could eventually be cured.\n\u2026\n[52] Parliament did not require that directors be subject to an absolute liability for the remittances of their corporations. Consequently, Parliament has accepted that a corporation may, in certain circumstances, fail to effect remittances without its directors incurring liability. What is required is that the directors establish that they were specifically concerned with the tax remittances and that they exercised their duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts.\n\u2026\n[56] A director of a corporation cannot justify a defence under the terms of subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act where he condones the continued operation of the corporation by diverting employee source deductions to other purposes. The entire scheme of section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act, read as a whole, is precisely designed to avoid such situations. In this case, though the respondent had a reasonable (but erroneous) expectation that the sale of the online course development division could result in a large payment which could be used to satisfy creditors, he consciously transferred part of the risks associated with this transaction to the Crown by continuing operations knowing that employee source deductions would not be remitted. This is precisely the mischief which subsection 227.1 of the Income Tax Act seeks to avoid.\n\u2026\n[57] Once the trial judge found as a matter of fact that the respondent's efforts after February 2003 were no longer directed towards the avoidance of failures to remit, no successful defence under either subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act or subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act could be sustained.\n[Emphasis added]\n\u2026\n[23] Given the specific wording of the subsections and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s comments in Buckingham, it appears somewhat difficult to imagine circumstances in which an informed and active owner-manager and director of a corporation will not be liable for unremitted employee source deductions and unremitted GST amounts. As mentioned above, the scope of the Worrell exception post-Buckingham remains to be developed in other cases than the Deakins\u2019.\n[24] Source deductions and GST remittances are required by law to be made by a business corporation. These are not the corporation\u2019s own funds. The corporation has collected them from its employees and customers. Those employees and customers are given credit for these amounts once withheld and collected, even when not remitted. When owner-managers and directors decide to use these funds to keep their business afloat and support their investments, they are making all Canadian taxpayers invest involuntarily in a business and investment in which they have no upside. In doing so, shareholders and corporate decision-makers are investing or gambling with other people\u2019s money. Directors should be aware of that when they cause or permit this to happen. The directors\u2019 liability provisions of the legislation should be regarded by business persons as somewhat similar to a form of personal guarantee by the directors that can expose them to comparable liability for the amount involved. It is they who are deciding to invest the funds in their own business, for their own gain, not the government or people of Canada. They are doing so contrary to clear law and it appears appropriate as a policy matter that Parliament has legislated clearly that they will generally be responsible for such decisions and the loss resulting from them. In essence, if a corporation and its directors choose to unilaterally \u201cborrow\u201d from Canadian taxpayers and the public purse, Canadians get the benefit of security akin to personal guarantees of the directors.\n[6] The Federal Court of Appeal in HMQ v. Chriss 2016 FCA 236 wrote about the requirement, at least under Ontario law, that a resignation is not effective in the absence of a written resignation to the corporation. That Court wrote:\n[11] The reasons underlying the requirement of a written resignation which is communicated to the company are self-evident. Third parties rely on representations as to who is responsible for the governance of a corporation. Business decisions may be made on the basis of directorship of a corporation.\n[12] Many laws attach liability to former directors within a certain period of time after resignations; see, for example, Employment Standards Act, 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 41, Part XIV.2. So too does the Income Tax Act subsection 227.1(4) of which provides a two-year limitation period on actions for recovery of amounts owing by directions. The two years is triggered by the date of resignation.\n[13] This limitation period demands, for its application, precision in the date of resignation. If a director has resigned, the Crown may no longer be able to look to the director for unremitted taxes, and other directors may have to absorb the director\u2019s share of such liability. Further, there is a two-year limitation period which constrains the Minister\u2019s ability to initiate proceedings against directors for unremitted source deduction.\n[14] It is thus self-evident that the status of directors must be capable of objective verification. Reliance on the subjective intention or say-so of a director alone would allow a director to plant the seeds of retroactive resignation, only to rely on it at some later date should a director-linked liability emerge. The facts of this case illustrate why subsection 121(2) of the OBCA has been drafted the way it is: the dangers associated with allowing anything less than delivery of an executed and dated written resignation are unacceptable.\n[15] There was no \u201cwritten resignation received by the corporation\u201d within the meaning of subsection 121(2). Unsigned letters of resignation with no effective date, were found in the solicitor\u2019s file, thus, the judge erred in concluding that the intention of the respondents\u2019 to resign satisfied the necessary preconditions of an effective resignation.\n\u2026\n[18] The scope of the due diligence defence is informed by the nature or subject matter of the director\u2019s responsibility in question. Here, the question in respect of which due diligence is raised is fundamental to corporate governance \u2013 am I or am I not a director? There can be no ambiguity in the answer to that question.\n[19] A director\u2019s belief that they have resigned has no correspondence or connection to the underlying purposes of subsection 121(2) of the OBCA and its emphasis on an objectively verifiable communication of a resignation to the corporation. To allow a subjective intention to suddenly spring to life, when, in the affairs of the corporation, or in the interests of the director, it is convenient to do so, would significantly undermine corporate governance. A reasonable belief that one has resigned must hew much closer to the requirements for an actual effective resignation. In addition, there was no communication of the resignation to the corporation. The draft letters never left the solicitor\u2019s office. The requirement that the resignations be received by the corporation cannot be ignored.\n[20] Secondly, due diligence defences arise only by virtue of subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act. The scope of defence is thus informed by, or takes its shape in light of, the obligations in question. In Canada v. Buckingham, 2011 FCA 142 this Court gave clear direction with respect to the interpretation of the due diligence defence in subsection 227.1(3). The Court held, at paragraph 37, that \u201cthe standard of care, skill and diligence required under subsection 227.1(3) [\u2026] is an objective standard as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Peoples Department Stores.\u201d This objective standard is evaluated against a reasonably prudent person \u201cin comparable circumstances.\u201d The Income Tax Act is a key contextual element, which \u201crequires more of directors and officers than the traditional common law duty of care.\u201d More particularly, to satisfy the defence in subsection 227.1(3), \u201ca director must thus establish that he turned his attention to the required remittances and that he exercised his duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts\u201d (at para. 40).\n[21] As noted by the Court in Buckingham, a higher standard is an incentive for corporations to improve the quality of board decisions through the establishment of good corporate governance rules and discourages the appointment of inactive directors who fail to discharge their duties as director by leaving decisions to the active directors. One consequence of this is that a person who is appointed as a director must carry out the duties of that function on an active basis and will not be allowed to defend a claim for malfeasance in the discharge of his or her duties by relying on his or her own inaction.\n\u2026\n[24] Directors must carry out their duties on an active basis. A director cannot raise a due diligence defence by relying on their own indifferent or casual attitude to their responsibilities. A reasonable director would insist on being satisfied that their intention to resign had been effected.\n\u2026\n[31] If a corporation faces bankruptcy and a third party offers the corporation a reprieve from bankruptcy if the corporation dips into what is, in effect, a trust account held for the benefit of its employees, as is the case here, the law is clear as to the obligations of the directors. They must not take from or dissipate the employee deductions. If they diverge from the course of action the law prescribes, they do so at their peril.\n(emphasis added)\n[7] More recently the Federal Court of Appeal wrote in Cliff v. HMQ 2022 FCA 16 at paragraph 15:\n[15] Form 1 is not a resignation; rather, it is a notice entitled \u201cInitial Return\/Notice of Change\u201d. Nor is it a communication to the corporation; rather it is a communication from the corporation to the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations. While Form 1 indicates that the appellant ceased to be a director on December 12, 2003, there is no evidence as to when Form 1 was completed and there is no place on the Form 1 for a director\u2019s signature, physical or digital or otherwise. For a resignation to be effective, there must be evidence that the corporation received a written resignation confirming that the appellant has resigned. While Form 1 may reflect something that may have happened, it is not a substitute for a written resignation.\nII. Findings and Conclusion [8] For the reasons that follow, Mr. Ferri\u2019s appeal is dismissed.\n[9] I have concluded that Mr. Ferri\u2019s evidence on the two issues above do not rise to the level needed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he was not still a director when the requisite remittances were not made, or that he had not been a director in the two years prior to the assessments being issued.\n[10] Mr. Ferri acknowledged that he was a director starting in May 1997 but maintained that he resigned as director on October 31, 1999 when he said that he delivered his written resignation to the corporation\u2019s lawyer, Paul Leon. Mr. Ferri said Mr. Leon told him that the requisite Ontario Form 1 Notice of Change had been filed.\n[11] When Mr. Ferri became aware in 2007 that the Ontario provincial registry continued to show him as a director, Mr. Ferri said that he mailed a second Form 1 Notice of Change to the Ontario provincial authorities again with an effective date of October 31, 1999 \u2014 even though he said he had obtained a copy of the original Form 1 from Mr. Leon in 2005 for some reason.\n[12] Provincial corporate registries are not determinative on the issue of whether a person is or is not a director for purposes of the director liability provisions of the Act. However, it is clear that neither of the 1999 or 2007 Form 1 notices of resignation were reflected in the Ontario registry.\n[13] Mr. Leon testified and acknowledged that he was the corporation\u2019s lawyer. He had been able to find the 1999 Form 1 in his file but nothing else and has no specific recollections. His file did not have a copy of a resignation (draft or signed), a cover letter or email to the provincial registrar for the Form 1, or a note from him or his assistant that it was ever sent. He did not have any corporate resolution or other communication acknowledging or accepting the resignation or appointing any new director, nor any communication from him to his client (the corporation) regarding one of its directors resigning. He did not have the minute book nor did he know what his office had done with it even though he continued for a period of time as the corporation\u2019s lawyer.\n[14] Neither Mr. Leon or Mr. Ferri satisfied me they had used their best efforts to try to locate such potentially important evidence, even after the Court noted this and offered to reopen evidence if efforts were made, whether successful or not. This offer was not taken up.\n[15] Mr. Leon said he would have instructed his secretary to prepare and file a Form 1 upon receiving Mr. Ferri\u2019s 1999 resignation. He said he was contacted years later by Mr. Ferri concerned that his resignation had not been filed and that is when he faxed Mr. Ferri a copy of the Form 1 and confirmed that it had been sent to the Ontario Ministry. I take it from Mr. Ferri\u2019s evidence that this was in 2005. There is no evidence that Mr. Leon had or had sent Mr. Ferri anything other than the Form 1. The Court was not provided with any other evidence from the Ontario Ministry than printed out corporate profile pages. It appears no actual file records were sought from the Ontario Ministry.\n[16] Mr. Ferri acknowledged he did not send a copy of his resignation or any communication about it to the corporation, to the individual he said replaced him as a director, or to the corporation\u2019s shareholders, the largest of which he said he represented. He did not ask anyone at the corporation to have him removed as director \u2014 even after his concerns that Mr. Leon might not have done so.\n[17] No one was identified by Mr. Ferri or was called as a witness by him who knew more about the corporation than himself, or who understood or knew who really ran at. Mr. Ferri maintained that after October 1999 he was merely a financial consultant to the company, but was guarded and I believe less than candid about who else he knew to be running the corporation. The evidence was clear that Mr. Ferri was operating at a functional level well above Ms. Karen Chambers, who was the corporation\u2019s office manager throughout the relevant period up until 2014 or 2015 when she bought the business in an asset purchase and continues to run it. Her role as office manager was described as essentially being the chief operating officer for the corporation.\n[18] Ms. Chambers also testified. I found her answers to be relatively forthcoming and credible. Ms. Chambers told Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) during the relevant years that Mr. Ferri was a director. She had replied on Mr. Ferri\u2019s behalf to CRA communications directed to the corporation or Mr. Ferri about the unremitted withholdings. She said she would not have done this, or negotiated the repayment schedule with CRA for these years without Mr. Ferri\u2019s knowledge. She was certain she would have asked for and obtained his advice and opinions on that topic. She said Mr. Ferri was involved in all big decision\u2011making such as financial statements, books and records, shareholder dividends, and bonuses. She said she always assumed Mr. Ferri was a director even though she was not privy to the corporate minute book, and she may have obtained this information from a corporate profile. Ms. Chambers said she had never met Sam Mingle, the person Mr. Ferri said replaced him as director in 1999. In answer to one of my questions to her following redirect, Ms. Chambers shared that her new metal stamping company, which continued the North American Tool and Die business, rented its premises from Mr. Ferri \u2014 that he was her landlord, and that Mr. Ferri or his counsel had, since 2017, approached her to clarify her understanding of events. She said this possibly extended beyond the information in the corporate profile she was given to prove she was in error thinking and telling others that Mr. Ferri was a director. She said she was given the corporate profile but had still never seen the minute book or other corporate records. She did not receive the corporate minute book as part of her asset purchase of the business, which is understandable.\n[19] I infer from Ms. Chambers\u2019 evidence and her letter that she had been informed as office manager that Mr. Ferri was a director following his 1997 appointment and that she never had reason to believe he had ceased to be a director when she sent her letter to CRA based on his involvement and interaction with her, the corporaton and its new shareholder that he represented.\n[20] The fact that Sam Mingle was not called as a witness to corroborate that he was appointed to the board to replace Mr. Ferri in 1999, nor was any other witness associated with the corporation\u2019s ownership or governance, is strongly suggestive that would not be their testimony. Nor was any witness called from whichever law firm acted as corporate counsel after Mr. Leon ceased to represent it in 1999. The testimony of Mr. Ferri and Mr. Leon was somewhat light on their efforts to locate it, or why it may have perished in a house fire.\n[21] I did not find Mr. Ferri to be an entirely candid and credible witness. He frequently said he did not recall things, even though he remembered other things very clearly from the same period. He was at best guarded in disclosing who was behind the new shareholder of the corporation, even though he represented them and was paid by them. Mr. Ferri was at times non responsive in his answers, or evasive, and was instead inclined to repeat his version of events when questioned about other things. Mr. Ferri only acknowledged in cross-examination that he had lost his Chartered Accountant designation for moral turpitude, unacceptable behavior and professional misconduct for his role in the Astra Trust Company financial scandal of the early 1980s. Mr. Ferri was charged, convicted and incarcerated for his role in the Astra Trust scandal. He says he was later pardoned. He was not initially forthcoming about having subsequently been charged with extortion, fraud or theft involving another financial institution, though he testified those later charges were dismissed.\n[22] He was notably evasive, difficult and avoidant when asked about the nature of his later business consulting. He didn\u2019t recall if he ever owned a business, and if he could have been a shareholder of any private companies, nor did he recall which corporations he was ever a director of, acknowledging only that he had held directorships at various periods of time, and could not recall if he had been a director of any since 1999.\n[23] There are inconsistencies within Mr. Ferri\u2019s testimony and his notice of appeal. He appears to have tried to file a Form 1 removing himself as director but leaving himself as President and Secretary even though he said he did not hold those roles.\n[24] With respect to Sam Mingle replacing Mr. Ferri as director in October 1999, it is noteworthy that the Ontario provincial registry shows Mr. Mingle was recorded to have been added as director by 2014, but Mr. Ferri still remained recorded as director. This was not explained. Further, provincial records show entries that Mr. Ferri continued to file the corporation\u2019s Annual Returns with the province after October 1999.\n[25] In these circumstances, there is simply insufficient credible, consistent, reliable evidence to allow the Court to conclude on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Ferri delivered a written resignation as director to the corporation effective October 31, 1999. Similarly, the Court is unable to conclude on a balance of probabilities that any of the Form 1s reporting Mr. Ferri\u2019s removal as director were filed with the Ministry prior to 2017.\n[26] A Form 1, even accepting the date on it, that was the sole relevant document in the corporate counsel\u2019s file is not evidence sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Ferri ceased to be a director on that date, especially where there are reliability and\/or credibility concerns with both Mr. Leon and Mr. Ferri. The probative value of Ms. Chambers\u2019 evidence was impaired as a result of communications and material being provided to her by Mr. Ferri about this case.\n[27] I need emphasize that I place little to no reliance on the CRA\u2019s Report on Objection in evidence as it clearly contains significant overstatements about what Mr. Ferri wrote to CRA and an even greater overstatement about the results of the Canada Border Service Agency\u2019s test for dating the ink used to sign Mr. Ferri\u2019s Form 1. These were completely unacceptable, and, unsurprisingly, led to a waste of public resources in this proceeding and hearing. Mr. Ferri, like any other Canadian, was entirely reasonable in responding very fully to an unsubstantiated allegation and untruth about CBSA\u2019s initial suspicions, which is the highest they could be described as. CRA did not act on that suspicion and pursue it with any expert analysis, but wrote accusing Mr. Ferri of essentially forging or evidence tempering. What the CRA Officer wrote was not at all what the CBSA reported to it, nor was it what CBSA was asked to do. This must be most strongly discouraged, especially at the objection stage as a taxpayer\u2019s sole remedy after that is to formally appeal to this Court.\n[28] That is not what CBSA reported CRA. If anything, the fact that CRA chose not to actually have the ink dated indicates CRA did not make any relevant assumption regarding when the Form I was signed and I make no finding in that regard as that would have required an expert report from the respondent. I can note that there is absolutely no evidence of any probative value that the Form 1 was in fact signed on any other date. That Report and the respondent\u2019s reliance on it in this proceeding is the sole reason I am not awarding costs at Tariff level.\n[29] The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 28th day of February 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 25\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2017-2569(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nANDREW FERRI AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nToronto, Ontario\nDATE OF HEARING:\nMarch 14, 15 and 16, 2023\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Patrick Boyle\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 28, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nJeff Warwick\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nKhalid Tariq\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nJeff Warwick\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n",

INTRODUCTION\n[1] These Reasons pertain to the Appeals brought by Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. (\u201cSkylight\u201d), Suresh Kumar Aravindakshan (\u201cSuresh\u201d) and Titus George (\u201cTitus\u201d) in respect of assessments issued to them, under the Employment Insurance Act (the \u201cEIA\u201d)[1] and the Canada Pension Plan (the \u201cCPP\u201d)[2], by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d), as represented by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d). The fundamental question in respect of these Appeals is whether Suresh, Titus and other workers were engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment. In particular, in the case of Skylight\u2019s Appeal, two specific issues are whether Selvy Thomas (\u201cSelvy\u201d) was engaged in pensionable employment and whether Sheela Thomas (\u201cSheela\u201d) was engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment.\n[2] As is apparent, Selvy and Sheela have the same surname; however, they are not related. To avoid confusion, I will refer to them by their given names. To be consistent, I will also refer to the two individual Appellants and the other workers by their given names.\n[3] On July 9, 2018, the Minister issued Notices of Assessment for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017 (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d) to assess premiums under the EIA and contributions under the CPP. Those assessments (the \u201cAssessments\u201d) were based on the assumptions that Sheela, Suresh, Titus and Akhill Jolly (\u201cAkhill\u201d) were employed by Skylight in insurable employment, and that Selvy, Sheela, Suresh, Titus and Akhill were employed by Skylight in pensionable employment. After considering objections in respect of the Assessments, on November 7, 2018 the Minister confirmed the Assessments.\nII. FACTS\n[4] Skylight was incorporated in 2004. Initially, Selvy was the sole shareholder of Skylight. Sometime thereafter, Sheela became a 50% shareholder of Skylight, and Selvy continued to own the other 50% of the issued shares of Skylight.\nA. Particulars Concerning Selvy\n[5] During the Relevant Period, Selvy was an executive, a director and a shareholder of Skylight. She stated that she \u201cstarted Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. in the year 2004.\u201d[3]\n[6] Initially, Selvy was the sole shareholder of Skylight. Sometime after October 31, 2017, Selvy\u2019s equity interest in Skylight was reduced to 50%.[4]\nB. Particulars Concerning Sheela\n[7] At some point in time, after October 31, 2017, Selvy arranged for Sheela to become a 50% shareholder of Skylight. Selvy said that Sheela was her partner and that Sheela \u201cwork[ed] selling packages.\u201d[5]\nC. Particulars Concerning Akhill and Giya\n[8] While testifying, Selvy explained that, during the Relevant Period, Skylight had four employees, i.e., herself, Sheela, Akhill and Giya Joy (\u201cGiya\u201d). Selvy stated that Akhill and Giya had been engaged as employees and were treated as such. Akhill and Giya each received a salary, were issued T4 slips after each taxation year, had a work station at Skylight\u2019s premises, had fixed office hours, and were supervised as employees. Selvy stated that the circumstances in respect of the employment of Akhill and Giya were substantially different from the circumstances in respect of the arrangements that Skylight had with Suresh and Titus.\n[9] Although Skylight seemed to treat Akhill as an employee, the Minister approached the audit of Skylight on the premise that Skylight had viewed Akhill as an independent contractor.[6]\nD. Particulars Concerning Suresh\n[10] During his direct examination, Suresh stated that he came to Canada from India in 2015. However, during cross-examination he indicated that he came to Canada in 2010, and then worked for three years as a shift manager at a fast food restaurant in Toronto, before enrolling in a travel and tourism course at Everest College. After completing that course, Suresh learned of a vacancy at Skylight and applied. During his initial interview, he was asked by Selvy whether he would like to work as a contractor or as an employee. He chose to work as a contractor, on a commission basis.\n[11] A primary aspect of Suresh\u2019s work was to assemble tour packages. Drawing on his prior experience working as a hotel operations manager in India and as a worker in food services positions in Saudi Arabia, Suresh prepared tour packages for South Asia. The packages were all-inclusive, in the sense that they included flights, hotels, ground transportation (or transfers) and excursions. He worked with two suppliers, which he identified as Tamarind Services International (which made the specific arrangements with the various hotels and transportation companies in South Asia)[7] and Tours East (which provided airline tickets). Sometimes, using SABRE, Suresh arranged the airline transportation for his clients.[8]\n[12] Suresh stated that he primarily worked at home, where he had a home office or work space. The furniture in his home office included a desk, which he had purchased himself, a chair, a laptop computer and his cell phone. He attended at Skylight\u2019s place of business occasionally, generally on a monthly basis, to drop off a list setting out the tour packages and other travel arrangements that he had made and the commissions earned in respect thereof. Suresh stated that he did not have any assistance from Skylight in compiling the tour packages. He typically dropped off his sales reports, which were entitled \u201cAgent Commission Forms\u201d and which were sometimes referred to as invoices.\n[13] The commissions earned by Suresh in respect of his sales were split with Skylight. Suresh was entitled to 70% of each commission, and Skylight was entitled to 30% of each commission. This had been discussed and negotiated during Suresh\u2019s initial meeting with Selvy, and was referenced in the confirmation letter signed by Selvy and Suresh on April 5, 2015.[9]\n[14] Suresh found his clients primarily through social media, friends and connections within his community in Toronto. His social media advertising was generally done by posts (which he called fliers) on Facebook.\n[15] Suresh stated that he obtained no support from Skylight in assembling tour packages, other than access to SABRE and the use of Skylight\u2019s name, which he acknowledges had some value.\n[16] Suresh was not aware of Skylight\u2019s office hours, as he worked primarily at home and set his own hours, and was his own boss.\n[17] He stated that Selvy did not question the amount of his production or suggest that he should increase his production, nor did she review his work.\n[18] Suresh could take days off whenever he wished. He did not need to obtain permission from Selvy or anyone else at Skylight to take a vacation. However, if he was going to be away for more than a few days, as a courtesy, he advised Skylight that he would be on vacation. Skylight did not provide vacation pay to him.\n[19] Skylight made business cards available to its workers. However, Suresh stated that he made his own business cards, which he apparently preferred to use. He paid for the printing of his own business cards. His business cards showed both Skylight\u2019s name and his name, as well as the telephone numbers and fax number of Skylight and his own cell phone number. The business cards also showed his Skylight email address and the domain name of Skylight\u2019s website.\n[20] Suresh stated that he could not be reached by calling Skylight\u2019s office telephone number. If someone called that number, asking for him, whoever answered the phone at Skylight\u2019s office generally gave the caller Suresh\u2019s cell phone number.\n[21] Suresh purchased a cell phone in 2013. During the Relevant Period, he owned it and paid the monthly phone bills.\n[22] Although his business cards showed Skylight\u2019s fax number, his clients never sent faxes to him. They always communicated with him by email or by calling him on his cell phone. They did not try to reach him by calling the telephone number of Skylight\u2019s office.\nE. Particulars Concerning Titus\n[23] Decades ago, Titus, who was 69 years of age when the trial commenced, had been a travel agent in Dubai. In 1996, he came to Canada for a brief period of time, then went abroad for almost five years, and subsequently returned to Canada sometime in 2000. For approximately 15 years he worked in non\u2011travel\u2011related endeavours. Desiring to return to the travel field, in 2015 Titus approached Skylight, seeking a part-time position. He selected Skylight because it focused on travel to South India, which was his preferred area of work.\n[24] According to Selvy and Titus, at their initial meeting, on January 11, 2015, Selvy arranged for a brief letter to be printed on Skylight letterhead, after which they both signed the letter. As the letter is quite brief, the substantive portion thereof is quoted below:\nWe would like to confirm that you (Mr. Titus George) are presently working with Skylight Travel & Tours Inc as a contractor in the department of Travel and Tourism. You are employed as travel agent based on commissions to be paid as agreed at the time of acceptance. Please note that you will be responsible for filing your own income taxes and paying all the applicable government taxes at the end of the year with your accountant directly.[10]\n[25] Selvy testified that she understood that Titus had been engaged by Skylight to work as an independent contractor. It was not expressly clear from Titus\u2019 testimony as to what was his precise intention in respect of his status. It seems that he was more concerned about ensuring that he would be engaged on a part\u2011time, rather than a full\u2011time, basis.\n[26] Although Titus had worked extensively in Dubai as a travel agent, that was a number of years previous to his being engaged by Skylight. In Dubai, he had not used the SABRE airline reservation system. Accordingly, he needed training in respect of SABRE and other aspects of the Canadian travel industry. That training took about one week, in respect of which he did not receive any remuneration or other payment from Skylight.\n[27] All travel agents in Ontario are required to be licensed with the Travel Industry Council of Ontario (\u201cTICO\u201d). Titus wrote the TICO exam and paid, out of his own pocket, the $200 examination fee. Skylight did not reimburse him for that amount.\n[28] Titus did not book tours. His work consisted of making airline reservations for clients, for which he earned commissions.\n[29] Skylight did not control Titus\u2019 work hours. Titus only advised Skylight, and did not seek permission, before going on vacation. The amount of his production was never questioned.[11] Skylight did not provide Titus with office supplies, other than business cards.[12]\nF. Billing and Compensation Arrangements for Suresh and Titus\n[30] Neither Suresh nor Titus was paid a salary or wages by Skylight. As noted above, the only earnings received by Suresh and Titus were 70% of the commissions received by Skylight in respect of their sales. Given the nature of the airline, hotel and other travel\u2011related industries, and the manner in which travelling customers purchase tickets, accommodation and other tour\u2011related amenities, the commissions pertaining to the work done by Suresh and Titus were paid to Skylight. On a periodic basis, Suresh and Titus each provided Skylight with tabulations showing the tickets, tours or other packages that had been purchased by their respective clients and the amount of commission paid to Skylight on behalf of Suresh or Titus, as the case may have been. Upon receiving those statements and upon confirming that the commissions had been received by Skylight, Skylight then periodically issued cheques to Suresh and Titus, so as to pay their respective 70% portions of those commissions.\nIII. ISSUES\n[31] The issues in respect of these Appeals are the following:\na)During the Relevant Period, was Selvy engaged in pensionable employment?\nb)During the Relevant Period, was Sheela engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nc)During the Relevant Period, was Akhill engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nd)During the Relevant Period, was Suresh engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\ne)During the Relevant Period, was Titus engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nIV. EVIDENTIARY CONCERNS\nA. Letter Agreements\n[32] Early in the trial, a voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of a letter agreement dated April 5, 2015 between Skylight and Suresh,[13] and, eventually, a somewhat similar letter agreement dated January 11, 2015 between Skylight and Titus (most of which is quoted above).[14] Counsel for the Minister objected to the introduction of those two letter agreements, on the ground that the Notice of Appeal stated that there was only a verbal agreement.[15] It seems that counsel for the Minister was also concerned that the letter agreements were late\u2011produced, self\u2011serving documents. A copy of Suresh\u2019s letter agreement was provided to counsel for the Minister only a week before the trial began, and a copy of Titus\u2019 letter agreement was not made known to his own counsel, let alone counsel for the Minister, until partway through the voir dire.\n[33] A further concern related to the letterhead on which the two letter agreements were printed, as the two letter agreements showed different addresses for Skylight. By way of background, Selvy explained that, from the time of its incorporation, in 2004, until sometime before 2015, Skylight\u2019s address had been located at 3428 Sheppard Avenue East, Scarborough, Ontario. In 2015, Skylight\u2019s address was located at 3300 McNicoll Avenue, Scarborough.[16] Sometime thereafter, Skylight moved its office to 3341 Markham Road, Toronto. Titus testified that, when he met with Selvy in January 2015 for his initial application interview, Skylight\u2019s office was located at 3300 McNicoll Avenue. However, the address shown on Titus\u2019 letter agreement, which was dated January 11, 2015, was 3341 Markham Road. The address shown on Suresh\u2019s letter agreement, which was dated April 5, 2015, was 3428 Sheppard Avenue East.\n[34] Selvy explained the above discrepancies by indicating that, when Skylight moved its office from Sheppard Avenue to McNicoll Avenue, Skylight had a large supply of unused letterhead showing the Sheppard Avenue address. Skylight continued to use that letterhead until it was exhausted. It was for that reason that the letter agreement between Skylight and Suresh showed the Sheppard Avenue address. Selvy also explained that, in 2017 or thereabouts, Titus needed to send a copy of his letter agreement to TICO, but could not find his copy of it. The text of the letter agreement was still stored in Skylight\u2019s computer; therefore, Selvy arranged for the letter agreement to be reprinted on Skylight\u2019s letterhead, which, at that time, showed the new address on Markham Road.\n[35] Selvy, Suresh and Titus each testified that she or he (as the case may have been) had signed the applicable letter agreement. In my view, there is no question as to the authenticity or genuineness of the two letter agreements, although there may be a question as to whether they were backdated. Accordingly, at the conclusion of the voir dire, I admitted the two letter agreements into evidence, but indicated that I would determine the weight, if any, to be given to them.\n[36] In making the above decision (to admit the letter agreements into evidence), I accepted Selvy\u2019s explanation. It is not uncommon for a business to use up outdated letterhead before switching to new letterhead that contains up-to-date information. Both Selvy and Titus (who was not present in the courtroom when Selvy testified) confirmed that the letter agreement of January 11, 2015 had been reprinted in 2017 or thereabouts, as a copy of it was required by TICO. A further point to note is that, if Selvy, Suresh and Titus had desired to fabricate the letter agreements on the eve of the trial of these Appeals, it is likely that both letter agreements would have been printed on the same letterhead. The fact that the two letter agreements were printed on different letterhead tends to confirm that they were not fabricated on the eve of trial.\n[37] As indicated above, the Minister and the CRA are concerned that they had apparently been told by Selvy, Suresh or Titus that the only agreements between Skylight and Suresh and between Skylight and Titus were verbal agreements, and not written agreements. In reviewing the EI Notice of Appeal and the CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Skylight, I note that paragraph 6 of each of those pleadings stated, \u201cThe verbal agreement with Skylight and these individuals \u2026 envisaged the following\u201d, and there then followed a list of nine terms describing the arrangements between Skylight and Suresh and between Skylight and Titus. I did not find any provision in either of those Notices of Appeal that said that there was only a verbal agreement, and not a written agreement, as well. In reviewing the EI Notice of Appeal and the CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Suresh and the EI Notice of Appeal and CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Titus, I did not find any specific reference to a verbal agreement or a written agreement per se. As is clear from reviewing the two letter agreements, the substantive portions of those two agreements are extremely brief. I do not find it unusual or inconsistent that each letter agreement would be supplemented by a verbal agreement setting out additional terms of the arrangement between Skylight and Suresh and the arrangement between Skylight and Titus. Furthermore, I did not find any statement, in the pleadings or otherwise, where Skylight, Suresh or Titus stated that there was only a verbal agreement and no written agreement.\n[38] After the trial, as I reviewed the various reports prepared by two CRA officers (whose reports will be discussed below), I noted that they had acknowledged that the intention of Skylight, Suresh and Titus was that those two individuals would work for Skylight as independent contractors, and not as employees.[17] Accordingly, I have determined that sufficient weight may be put on the letter agreements to confirm the intention of the parties thereto and the general nature of their respective relationships.\n[39] Although there was the occasional memory lapse,[18] I found Selvy, Suresh and Titus to be credible and generally reliable witnesses. Having considered their testimony and having reviewed the letter agreements and the circumstances of their formation, I have concluded that I may rely on each letter agreement as indicating an intention on the part of the parties thereto to create an independent\u2011contractor relationship, and not an employment relationship.\nB. Auditor\u2019s Reports and Testimony\n[40] Counsel for the Minister called two witnesses from the CRA. The first CRA witness, to whom I will refer as the \u201cRulings Officer\u201d, is currently an acting CPP\/EI Appeals Officer. She worked as a CPP\/EI Rulings Officer from 2013 to 2021. The second CRA witness, to whom I will refer as the \u201cAppeals Officer\u201d, began to work for the CRA in 2008. In 2014 she became a CPP\/EI Appeals Officer, and in 2018 she became a Resource Officer in CPP\/EI Appeals. She is currently a Program Advisor in Developing Program and Learning for the CPP\/EI Appeals Division.\n[41] The Rulings Officer wrote a Ruling Report in respect of Suresh[19] and another Ruling Report in respect of Titus.[20] The contents of the two Reports were almost identical. During her testimony, the Rulings Officer acknowledged that she had done a lot of cutting and pasting.[21]\n[42] Each of the two Ruling Reports is a composite document, beginning with details and particulars concerning Suresh (in the case of Exhibit R\u20112) and Titus (in the case of Exhibit R\u20113). There then follows a larger portion entitled \u201cFacts\u201d which is approximately six pages long, and which, among other things, purports to summarize separate telephone conversations that the Rulings Officer had on June 7, 2017 with Suresh and Titus respectively, as well as with Selvy. The next portion of each Ruling Report is entitled \u201cEmployment Status\u201d; it analyzed the facts that the Rulings Officer had purportedly obtained from Suresh and Titus respectively, as well as from Selvy. Each Ruling Report came to the conclusion that the particular worker (i.e., Suresh or Titus) was engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment. The final portion of each Ruling Report is entitled \u201cDecision\u201d. It seems to indicate that the status of the respective working arrangements in respect of Suresh and Titus was changed from \u201cContract for Service\u201d [sic] to \u201cContract of Service\u201d.\n[43] As noted above, the Rulings Officer acknowledged that she had done a lot of cutting and pasting in preparing her Reports. The analysis portions of the two Reports (i.e., the portions entitled \u201cEmployment Status\u201d) were identical. More troubling is the similarity between the summary of the two telephone conversations that the Rulings Officer had with Suresh and Titus respectively on June 7, 2017. Large portions of the summaries of those two conversations are identical. There are a few differences, such as an indication in the summary of the conversation with Titus, where he indicated that he was \u201cpaid strictly commission\u201d,[22] whereas there was no such statement in the summary of the conversation with Suresh. The summary of the conversation with Suresh states, \u201cHe confirmed all paperwork bears the name of Skylight.\u201d[23] There is no such statement in the summary of the conversation with Titus. Apart from these and a few other minor variations, the wording of the two summaries is essentially identical, subject to a few obvious efforts to make the two documents look different, such as referring to Suresh as a \u201cTicketing Agent\u201d and to Titus as a \u201cTravel Agent\u201d, or using the word \u201cstated\u201d in one summary and the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d in the corresponding place in the other summary, or using the word \u201cquotas\u201d in Titus\u2019 summary and the phrase \u201csales targets\u201d in Suresh\u2019s summary. Another example of this, which will be discussed below, is the use of \u201cHe laughed\u2026\u201d in Suresh\u2019s summary and \u201cHe chuckled\u2026\u201d in Titus\u2019 summary.\n[44] The extremely close similarity between the two Ruling Reports was explored during the examination in chief of the Rulings Officer in these terms:\nMS. ELLEITHY: \u2026 I did notice that \u2026 a lot of the wording is very similar. So, for example, \u2026 if we compare the ruling report at Tab 7 [Exhibit R\u20112] and Tab 8 [Exhibit R\u20113], there\u2019s a lot of similarities to the way it\u2019s structured, the order it\u2019s written and the wording. Could you explain why that is?\n[RULINGS OFFICER]: Yes, it is -- a lot of it is cut and paste because it\u2019s the same for each file. Like, again, when I reached out to the owner, that information would be a direct cut and paste into -- because I called at the same time. Again, if I left a message for -- to call me back regarding, you know, each worker, I certainly would change the name. But honestly, with this particular position, there\u2019s only -- and doing so many files, there\u2019s only so many ways you can write, you know, \u201cTools and equipment were not provided by the worker.\u201d\nSo, again, a lot of it has the same flow because that\u2019s just my writing style and addressing, you know, tools and equipment, and then subcontracting, and then getting into expenses. But again, it\u2019s personalized, too, because if something has been -- you know, to go back to the previous ruling report [i.e., Exhibit R\u20112], in respect of Suresh where I\u2019ve noted that they chuckled to a question, you know, that\u2019s specific to that individual.\nSo, that\u2019s why a lot of it appears to be the same because it is the same. A lot of it, the answers are the same, but I like to, again, make it specific to that worker as well that, you know, a conversation has taken place with this individual, because not everybody is going to chuckle to the same question or add their own comments.\nWe can\u2019t put, as I mentioned before, our personal opinions in the file, so that\u2019s sort of what we do, and in this case, I have done, is information that was substantially similar I\u2019ve put it in, and then tweaked it based on the specifics of that worker.[24] [Emphasis added.]\n[45] As indicated in the italicized portions of the above exchange between counsel for the Minister and the Rulings Officer, which took place during the discussion of the Ruling Report in respect of Titus (i.e., Exhibit R\u20113), the Rulings Officer made reference to her comment about \u201cthe previous ruling report\u201d (i.e., Exhibit R\u20112, being the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh), where she noted that the interviewee had chuckled to a question and pointed out that that was specific to that individual. That comment about \u201cthe previous ruling report\u201d occurred earlier in her testimony, when she was discussing the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh, and when she was asked by counsel for the Minister why she had included the \u201cHe laughed\u2026\u201d comment in her Report. The Rulings Officer replied:\nMS. ELLEITHY: And I wanted to ask, why would you -- why is that something to notate?\n[RULINGS OFFICER]: Well, it\u2019s an interesting reaction to the question, I think, and it speaks to -- like, it almost is -- you know, with somebody laughing and thinking the question is a joke, when it is a serious question, but to have that sort of reaction. And in the file, you know, I always like to add something that\u2019s sort of -- you know, because you can only write certain paragraphs, the information, the same way, so to add a little sort of personalized comment or reaction to the question.\nBut that particular question -- that\u2019s what I remember about this file.[25] [Emphasis added.]\n[46] When discussing Suresh and Exhibit R\u20112 (shortly before the above\u2011quoted exchange), the Rulings Officer had said that she remembered \u201cthe one gentleman chuckling about not going on vacation,\u201d but she could not remember whether the gentleman was Suresh or Titus.[26] The Rulings Officer may have been referring to the following comment that she wrote in the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh (as set out in Exhibit R\u20112):\nHe laughed when asked if he\u2019s received any personal invitations to experience resorts and stated that Selvy Thomas has as the owner of the travel agency.[27]\nOr she may have been referring to a comment that she wrote in the Ruling Report in respect of Titus (Exhibit R\u20113), which is quoted in the next paragraph.\n[47] Although I had initially understood that the Rulings Officer\u2019s reference to the chuckling was intended to show that she had remembered the distinct conversation and that her summary of that conversation was personalized to particularize that specific conversation,[28] I now question whether that was really the case, in light of the following statement from the summary of her conversation with Titus (i.e., Exhibit R\u20113):\nHe chuckled and stated he has not received any personal invitations to experience resorts and stated that Selvy Thomas has as the owner of the travel agency.[29]\n[48] During cross\u2011examination, counsel for the Appellants noted that significant portions of the Rulings Officer\u2019s summaries of her telephone conversations with Suresh and Titus appeared to be \u201cword for word\u201d the same and that they \u201clooked like a cut and paste.\u201d[30] Then, when counsel for the Appellants suggested to the Rulings Officer that she had not tweaked the two summaries (as she had claimed),[31] she replied:\nThere are parts that are specific to each of the individuals. But after doing this job so many times, it gets a little - - it\u2019s not a creative writing assignment.[32]\n[49] I am deeply concerned by the manner in which the Ruling Reports were prepared. With respect to the Rulings Officer\u2019s summaries of her telephone conversations with Suresh and Titus, I am left with the impression that she had anticipated in advance the answers that she was seeking and that she had already developed the language needed to record those answers. With respect to the analytical portions of the Ruling Reports, the precisely identical wording of the analyses of the respective working arrangements pertaining to Suresh and Titus raises the question of whether one analysis was copied from the other, or whether both were copied from the same precedent.\n[50] Given the manner in which the Ruling Reports were prepared, I have concerns as to whether the Rulings Officer addressed the situations of Suresh and Titus separately, or whether she took a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to her audit. Consequently, where her Reports differ from the testimony of the Appellants, I am inclined to rely on that testimony, rather than the Reports.\n[51] To the extent that the Ruling Reports set out statements made to the Rulings Officer by Selvy, Suresh or Titus, a question arose during the trial as to whether those Reports contained hearsay evidence. Initially, counsel for the Minister had advised the Court that she desired to adduce the Reports for the truth of their contents. However, after the hearsay concern had been raised, counsel for the Minister stated that she was relying on the Reports only to challenge the credibility of the workers, i.e., to show that the particular statements had been made, and not that they were necessarily true. Based on the manner in which the Ruling Reports were drafted, I am not persuaded that those Reports correctly recorded the statements that had been made.\n[52] I do not consider that the Ruling Reports have impeached the credibility of Selvy, Suresh or Titus. Rather, given the \u201ccut and paste\u201d nature of the Reports, I question whether the Reports have accurately reproduced the statements that may have been made by Selvy, Suresh and Titus to the Rulings Officer.\n[53] A possible explanation for the similarity between the Ruling Reports in respect of Suresh (Exhibit R\u20112) and Titus (Exhibit R\u20113) might relate to a communication barrier between the Rulings Officer on the one hand and Suresh and Titus respectively on the other hand. Intending no disrespect, I found that, during their oral testimonies, it was difficult to understand Suresh from time to time, and even more difficult to understand Titus. In addition, there were various instances during Titus\u2019 testimony where it seemed that he had a general understanding of the questions that were put to him, but he did not understand those questions precisely. The communication difficulties that I observed during the hearing may well have been exacerbated over the telephone, which is the way in which the Rulings Officer interviewed Suresh and Titus.\n[54] Regardless of whether there was a communication barrier or not, there were several instances (such as the question of whether Suresh and Titus worked at home or in Skylight\u2019s office) where the statements written by the Rulings Officer in her Ruling Reports were diametrically opposed to the statements given by Suresh and Titus on the witness stand. As already mentioned, I found Suresh and Titus, as well as Selvy, to be credible and generally reliable. Accordingly, as indicated above, I prefer their evidence over the Ruling Reports prepared by the Rulings Officer.\n[55] Turning to the Appeals Officer, she had originally anticipated that she would testify on October 20, 2021; however, as the trial progressed more slowly than expected, she did not begin to testify until April 26, 2022. She stated that, in preparation for her anticipated testimony on October 20, 2021, she had, in October 2021, reviewed her Memo For File (Form T2020)[33] and her Report On An Appeal (Form CPT110).[34] However, she acknowledged that she had not reviewed the Memo and Report during the period between October 20, 2021 and the commencement of her testimony on April 26, 2022. She also acknowledged that she could not remember the specific conversations that she had had with Suresh and Titus. Accordingly, I have reservations about the reliability of her memory and her testimony.\n[56] I wish to make a comment about the terminology used by the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer (together, the \u201cOfficers\u201d) in their respective Reports. Rather than using the terms employment contract and independent contract, the Officers generally used the traditional historical terms contract of service and contract for services. While either set of terms is acceptable, when referring to a contract for services, the Officers often used the term contract of services. I found this terminology to be confusing, as it was not always clear whether they were referring to a contract of service and inadvertently put an s at the end of service, or whether they were referring to a contract for services and inadvertently substituted the word of for the word for. An example of this confusion is the following excerpt from one of the Appeals Officer\u2019s reports:\nIt is recommended that the parties involved in this appeal be advised, by Ministerial Notification, that after a complete and impartial review of information, the workers, Selvy Thomas, Sureh [sic] Aravindaksha [sic], George Titus [sic], Akhill Jolly and Sheela Thomas were engaged by the payer, Skylight Travel & Tours Inc., under a contract of service during their respected [sic] periods under review. The requirements of contract of services were met; therefore, employer\u2011employee relationships existed.[35] [Emphasis added.]\nV. ANALYSIS\nA. Selvy\u2019s Status\n[57] In Skylight\u2019s Notices of Appeal, Skylight pleaded that Selvy and Sheela each owned 50% of the common shares of Skylight, and that it was incorrect for one of the CRA auditors to state that Selvy owned 100% of the common shares of Skylight. However, during her testimony, Selvy clarified that she had owned 100% of the common shares of Skylight upon its incorporation and during the Relevant Period,[36] and that, sometime after the Relevant Period, Sheela acquired 50% of the issued common shares of Skylight.\n[58] As Selvy has always owned more than 40% of the common shares (which are presumed to be the only voting shares) of Skylight, her employment with Skylight was not insurable.[37]\n[59] In the course of the trial, Selvy acknowledged that, during the Relevant Period, she had been employed by Skylight in pensionable employment.[38]\nB. Sheela\u2019s Status\n[60] In its EI Notice of Appeal, Skylight took the position that Sheela and Selvy each owned 50% of its voting shares, such that, by reason of paragraph 5(2)(b) of the EIA, Sheela was not engaged in insurable employment.[39] As indicated above, during her testimony, Selvy stated that she and Sheela are currently equal voting shareholders of Skylight. However, during the Relevant Period, Selvy owned all of the voting shares of Skylight. Accordingly, while it appears that Sheela\u2019s current employment with Skylight is not insurable employment, her employment with Skylight during the Relevant Period was insurable employment.\n[61] In the course of the trial, Skylight conceded that, during the Relevant Period, Sheela had been employed by Skylight in insurable employment and pensionable employment.[40]\nC. Akhill\u2019s Status\n[62] Skylight\u2019s Notices of Appeal focus primarly on the particulars of Suresh and Titus, with a minor reference to Selvy and Sheela, and no reference to Akhill. In the course of the trial, it was acknowledged by Skylight that, during the Relevant Period, Akhill had been employed by Skylight in insurable employment and pensionable employment.[41]\nD. Legal Principles Applicable to Suresh and Titus\n[63] Based on the pleadings, it is the position of Skylight, Suresh and Titus that, during the Relevant Period, Skylight had engaged each of Suresh and Titus pursuant to an independent contract (sometimes called a contract for services), and not pursuant to a contract of employment (sometimes called a contract of service). On the other hand, the Minister takes the opposite position. To resolve this matter, it is necessary to apply the two-step analytical process described by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes.[42]\n[64] In Connor Homes, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that, in determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, it is necessary to consider the intention of the worker and the person who hired the worker, as well as considering the traditional factors enunciated in Sagaz Industries and Wiebe Door.[43] Those factors are:\n(a) Does the hirer control the worker\u2019s activities?\n(b) Does the hirer provide the tools and equipment required by the worker, or is the worker required to provide his or her own tools and equipment?\n(c) Does the worker hire his or her own helpers?\n(d) What is the degree of financial risk taken by the worker? In other words, does the worker have a risk of loss?\n(e) What is the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker?\n(f) Does the worker have an opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks?[44]\n[65] Over the past couple of decades, some courts have noted that, rather than there being a sharp dichotomy between an employment contract and an independent contract, there is a continuum, with the employer\u2011employee relationship at one end, the independent\u2011contractor relationship at the other end, and a hybrid, intermediate or dependent\u2011contractor relationship somewhere in the middle.[45] It is generally recognized that a hybrid, intermediate or dependent\u2011contractor relationship is akin to, but not the same as, an employer\u2011employee relationship.[46] In determining whether a worker is an employee or a dependent contractor, courts have typically applied the same principles that are used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.[47]\n[66] As the principles used to distinguish a dependent contractor from an employee are similar to those used to distinguish an independent contractor from an employee, in these Reasons, I will sometimes simply use the term contractor, rather than independent contractor or dependent contractor.\nE. Suresh\u2019s Status\n[67] Following the guidance provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes, I will first consider whether there was a mutual understanding or common intention between Skylight and Suresh regarding their relationship. I will then consider the factors identified in Sagaz and Wiebe Door in light of such mutual intent (if any) for the purpose of determining if, on balance, the relevant facts sustain and are consistent with such intent, or, if there was not a mutual intent, determining whether those factors point to employment or independent contract.\n(1) Intention [68] At the commencement of Suresh\u2019s relationship with Skylight, Selvy and Suresh signed a letter agreement, dated April 5, 2015, on Skylight letterhead. As the letter agreement was relatively brief, containing only one paragraph, I have quoted that paragraph below:\nWe would like to confirm that you (Suresh Aravindakshan) is [sic] presently working with Skylight Travel & Tours Inc as a contractor in the department of Travel and Tourism. Mr. Aravindakshan is earning 70 % agent\u2019s commissions as agreed at the time of acceptance. Please note that you will be responsible for filing your own income taxes and paying all the applicable government taxes at the end of the year with your accountant directly.[48]\n[69] Based on the above letter, as well as the testimony of Selvy and Suresh, it is my understanding that they both understood and intended that Suresh would work for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. As well, it appears that the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer also acknowledged that Selvy (on behalf of Skylight) and Suresh intended that Suresh would work as an independent contractor.[49]\n(2) Control [70] Concerning the question of whether Skylight had control over Suresh in respect of the work which he undertook for Skylight, Selvy testified that Skylight did not expect Suresh to work a certain number of hours each week or to produce a certain volume of sales.[50]\n[71] Suresh could take sick days or vacation whenever he wanted.[51] In his testimony, Suresh confirmed that he set his own work hours and that he could take time off whenever he wanted,[52] although he did advise Skylight when he was going on vacation and indicated the days that he would not be available for work.[53]\n[72] When Suresh made a sale to a client, he generally did not report the sale to Selvy.[54] However, Suresh did advise Selvy of clients coming to Skylight\u2019s office to pay for a tour package,[55] so that Skylight could promptly wire the money to the particular tour operator.[56]\n[73] Suresh prepared his own invoices in respect of the commissions that he earned in respect of the sales that he made. He took the invoices to Skylight\u2019s office every two weeks.[57]\n[74] Skylight regularly issued cheques to Suresh to pay 70% of his earned commissions to him, while Skylight retained the other 30%.[58]\n[75] Skylight did not conduct performance reviews in respect of Suresh, or set sales targets for him.[59]\n[76] Suresh\u2019s title at Skylight was Travel Tour Coordinator. This was a title that he selected himself. Skylight had no issue with that title.[60]\n[77] Based on my understanding of the evidence, Skylight did not control Suresh\u2019s activities. This factor points strongly toward independent\u2011contractor status.\n(3) Tools and Equipment [78] Suresh worked primarily from home, where he had established a home office or other work space. He paid for the office furniture, including a desk and chair, himself. He provided his own laptop computer and his own cell phone.[61] The office maintained by Skylight was quite small (approximately 450 to 550 square feet in size) and was regularly used by Selvy, Sheela, Akhill and Giya. There was little physical room for Suresh to work in Skylight\u2019s office, and he did not have a desk or work space in that office.[62] Suresh used his personal cell phone to conduct business, and he paid the cell phone bills himself.[63] Suresh provided all of his own office supplies and office equipment.[64]\n[79] Skylight provided Suresh with password access to Skylight\u2019s license to use SABRE, as well as with business cards showing Skylight\u2019s general phone number, toll\u2011free number and fax number.[65] Suresh stated that he obtained from Skylight the template for its business cards, and he printed his own cards at his own expense.[66] Suresh\u2019s clients generally called him on his cell phone, and rarely used Skylight\u2019s office phone when trying to reach him; they did not send faxes to him.[67] Skylight also provided Suresh with an email address and the use of Skylight\u2019s email system.[68]\n[80] Suresh did not pay a specific fee to Skylight for the use of SABRE, the use of the business card template or the use of Skylight\u2019s email system. Selvy and Suresh explained that a portion of Skylight\u2019s 30% share of Suresh\u2019s commissions was intended to cover those costs.[69]\n[81] This factor points in both directions.\n(4) Hiring of Helpers [82] Selvy stated, on behalf of Skylight, that Suresh could engage a third party as a subcontractor and that he could hire helpers to assist with his work.[70] Suresh stated that he did not have any occasion to engage a subcontractor or to hire a helper or assistant. It is unclear, from his testimony, whether Suresh understood that he did, or did not, have the authority to hire a helper.[71] While Selvy\u2019s evidence points toward an independent contract, rather than employment, given that Suresh did not hire any subcontractors or other helpers, and given that he did not seem to understand fully and clearly the questions put to him in respect of this factor, I am inclined to treat this as a neutral factor.\n(5) Risk of Loss [83] Before Suresh had even begun to work for Skylight, he had incurred expenses. In 2014, Suresh took various courses in respect of travel and tourism at Everest College, at his own expense.[72] Suresh also took preparatory courses for, and passed, the requisite TICO licensing exam, again at his own expense, before he began to work for Skylight.[73]\n[84] Given that Suresh worked from home, and had to provide his own laptop, cell phone, office furniture, supplies, advertising and other work\u2011related items, he incurred work\u2011related expenses on a regular basis. If a client were to book a trip with Suresh, and then subsequently cancel the trip, Suresh would not receive a commission, although he would receive a cancellation fee.[74] As well, as he was paid by commission only, it was possible that there may have been months in which his expenses exceeded his revenue.\n[85] My sense is that Suresh had relatively modest work\u2011related expenses. Nevertheless, as there was always a possibility that those expenses would exceed his revenue, Suresh had a risk of loss. This factor points toward independent contract.\n(6) Responsibility for Investment and Management [86] There was no evidence adduced in respect of this factor. Therefore, I consider it to be a neutral or inapplicable factor.\n(7) Opportunity for Profit [87] Akhill and Giya, who were travel consultants and who were acknowledged by Skylight to be employees, were paid by salary.[75] On the other hand, Suresh was paid by commission only. Furthermore, as Suresh had his own clients, he was able to negotiate a 70%\/30% split of the commission, rather than a 60%\/40% split, which (according to Selvy) is the standard allocation in the travel industry.[76]\n[88] Suresh assembled his own tour packages, which included airfare, hotel accommodation and day tours. He prepared his own fliers to advertise the packages, which were often scheduled to coincide with \u201csome festival time\u201d or holiday.[77] He advertised his tour packages by word of mouth, social media and other promotions. The flights included in the packages were booked through Skylight\u2019s SABRE system, but all other arrangements were made by Suresh without any support from Skylight.[78] Suresh, and not Skylight, set the prices of the tours that he sold.[79]\n[89] During cross\u2011examination, Suresh described the process that he used to assemble a tour package. Suresh typically engaged the services of a vendor or supplier in India, such as Tours East or Tamarind Services International, as he found that it was preferable to have all aspects of the package (such as flights, hotels and ground transportation) arranged through a single entity. However, Suresh prepared the package himself and then gave instructions to the vendor selected for that package to make the bookings in his name (or perhaps sometimes his clients\u2019 names). The vendor charged a price to Suresh, which he paid. In subsequently billing his clients, Suresh added a markup of 5%, 10%, 15% or thereabouts, as negotiated with his clients, who sometimes bargained with him in the hope of getting a discount.[80]\n[90] With respect to flights that Suresh booked using Skylight\u2019s SABRE account, he could not change the price that was available through SABRE, but he could, and did, decide the markup that he would add to that price.[81]\n[91] Suresh testified that he had his own clients. At the time of the trial, he stated that he had been working for six or seven years, and had a list of more than 500 clients. He also stated that Skylight does not have access to his list (or folder) of clients.[82]\n[92] Selvy stated that, if Suresh were to have left Skylight, he would have been able to take his client list with him to another travel agency.[83]\n[93] Suresh stated that he built his client list through contacts in his own community, through social media and other means, and that he did not get clients from Skylight.[84] However, Selvy indicated that Skylight occasionally referred to Suresh clients who desired to book a tour.[85] When asked, during cross\u2011examination, about referrals from Skylight, Suresh indicated that it happened \u201cvery, very rarely.\u201d[86]\n[94] The above summary of Suresh\u2019s commission\u2011based compensation system, with his ability to determine and negotiate the amount by which he marked up the base prices that he obtained from his vendors and other suppliers, clearly indicate that he had an opportunity for profit. This factor points strongly toward independent contract.\n(8) Weighing, Balancing and Resolving [95] The control factor, the risk of loss factor and the opportunity for profit factor point strongly toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship between Skylight and Suresh. The tools and equipment factor points in both directions, but I think that it tilts toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship. The hiring of helpers factor and the responsibility for investment and management factor are neutral or inapplicable factors.\n[96] After having considered, weighed and balanced the above factors, I have concluded that, during the Relevant Period, Suresh worked as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. In other words, on balance, the factors considered in Sagaz and Wiebe Door are consistent with the mutual understanding that Suresh worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. Therefore, during the Relevant Period, Suresh was not engaged in either insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight.\nF. Titus\u2019 Status\n[97] Following the guidance provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes, I will first consider whether there was a mutual understanding or common intention between Skylight and Titus regarding their relationship. I will then consider the factors identified in Sagaz and Wiebe Door in light of such mutual intent (if any) for the purpose of determining if, on balance, the relevant facts sustain and are consistent with such intent, or, if there was not a mutual intent, determining whether those factors point to employment or independent contract.\n(1) Intention [98] Based on Selvy\u2019s testimony and on the letter agreement dated January 11, 2015,[87] Skylight\u2019s intention was to engage Titus as a contractor. While Titus acknowledged signing the letter agreement, it is my impression that he did not fully understand the distinction between a contractor and an employee. In his testimony, Titus indicated that he was more concerned about ensuring that he would only be expected to work on a part-time basis and that he would be permitted to work from home, rather than being required to work from Skylight\u2019s office.[88]\n[99] Titus explained the manner in which his relationship with Skylight came together, as follows:\nMR. VANIER: Okay. And I understand you wanted to get back into the travel agency business.\nMR. GEORGE: Yeah, I -- I am interested in travel business because the reason I -- again, re-doing the -- with the part-time job. I don't want full-time job.\nMR. VANIER: Okay. Well, how did the relationship with you and Skylight, how did it begin?\nMR. GEORGE: I came to know them through one of my friends, because they are the only travel -- community travel doing business in South India travel business. They are the only one goes there.\nMR. VANIER: Okay. Did you approach them with a plan?\nMR. GEORGE: One of my friend introduced them, then I approached them. They are willing to help me with a part-time job.\nMR. VANIER: So can you tell me what was agreed to?\nMR. GEORGE: It was do my own business. They will give me the commission. That is the agreement.\nMR. VANIER: Was there much negotiation on the commission split?\nMR. GEORGE: They do 70 percent of the commission, and I am okay for that.[89]\n[100] During his testimony, Titus stated that he was not an employee of Skylight, but he then went on to say that he was only a part-time employee.[90] These statements were a bit confusing as they seemed to indicate that Titus may have been uncertain as to his status, or more likely (particularly given the language difficulties), he may not have fully understood the meanings of the terms contractor and employee.[91] Nevertheless, although there was a slight element of ambiguity, it seems that, overall, Skylight and Titus mutually understood that Titus worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee.\n[101] Furthermore, it is my understanding that the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer acknowledged that Skylight and Titus intended that Titus would work as an independent contractor.[92]\n(2) Control [102] During his testimony, Titus indicated that he was not concerned about earning a large amount of money, but he did want to work part-time in the travel industry.[93] Titus explained that he had a number of connections through his religious affiliation and that he had established a number of business connections because of the friendships that he had made in his church activities. Titus did not actively advertise. Rather, new clients came to him by word of mouth from other satisfied clients. Titus explained that he had a substantial amount of repeat business from long\u2011time clients.[94]\n[103] Selvy testified that there was no legal prohibition to keep Titus from working for somebody else. In other words, he was allowed to work for other people.[95] Titus stated that he understood that he had the ability to work for other travel agencies besides Skylight, but he was not interested in doing so.[96]\n[104] Titus performed almost all of his work at his home. He only went to the office to drop off his biweekly invoices and occasionally to meet with Skylight staff or airline representatives.[97]\n[105] Titus set his own hours, had his own customers, and worked whenever he liked.[98] Titus did not report to Skylight, other than when he submitted his invoices for the commissions that he had earned.[99]\n[106] Titus did not have fixed hours during which he was expected to work, and he could take sick days or vacation whenever he needed or wanted.[100] Titus notified Skylight when he was going on vacation for an extended period of time.[101]\n[107] Skylight permitted Titus to pick the title to be used by him while working with Skylight. He selected the title Sales Executive.[102]\n[108] Titus explained the typical manner in which his clients utilized his services. They typically telephoned him, explained that they would like to take a trip and gave him the details of the trip. They had often already ascertained the price of the flight that they would like to take. Titus proceeded to do the booking for the flight and he sent the details of the flight to a consolidator, which then issued the tickets and sent them to him by email, whereupon he forwarded the tickets to the clients. Titus explained that approximately 90% of his clients paid for their flights by credit card, and their credit card numbers were entered into the SABRE system as part of the booking process. The entire process was done without Titus having any physical contact with the clients, and without Titus interacting with Skylight, other than using the password provided by Skylight to access the SABRE system. After the booking had been made and the tickets had been issued, Titus sent an invoice to Skylight, to bill for 70% of the commission that was to be paid to Skylight by the airline.[103]\n[109] Skylight did not have any financial expectations of Titus (other than to receive 30% of the commissions earned by Titus). Skylight did not impose any financial goals, sales targets or benchmarks on Titus, nor did Skylight conduct any performance reviews in respect of Titus.[104]\n[110] The evidence indicates that Skylight did not control Titus. This factor strongly points toward independent\u2011contractor status.\n(3) Tools and Equipment [111] Skylight provided Titus with access to SABRE, business cards and an email address. Titus worked primarily from his home. Titus was required to provide his own computer, telephone, office furniture (which was located at his home) and vehicle.\n[112] Titus did not make specified payments to Skylight in respect of his use of SABRE or his email address and business cards. Rather, the compensation received by Skylight for those items came out of its 30% share of the commissions earned by Titus.[105]\n[113] Skylight did not provide Titus with office supplies.[106]\n[114] While this factor points in both directions, in my view it tilts toward contractor status.\n(4) Hiring of Helpers [115] Titus testified that he could not subcontract his work to a third party, nor could he hire anyone to help him with his work.[107]\n[116] This factor points toward employment.\n(5) Risk of Loss [117] As noted above, Titus incurred work\u2011related expenses, as he was required to provide his own laptop, cell phone, office furniture and office supplies.\n[118] Titus was also required to pay the fee for the TICO examination which he took at the commencement of his work with Skylight. He was not reimbursed by Skylight for that payment.[108]\n[119] Given that Titus was required to pay the above\u2011mentioned costs, and given that it was possible that his costs for a particular month or year might exceed his revenue for that month or year, he had a risk of loss. This factor points toward independent contract.\n(6) Responsibility for Investment and Management [120] This factor was not raised during the direct examination or the cross\u2011examination of Titus. This is an inapplicable factor.\n(7) Opportunity for Profit [121] Although Titus did not advertise through print or digital media, he worked hard to develop his clientele. He found his clients primarily through personal contact and maintaining good relationships with his relatives, friends, church congregants, and other persons with whom he had a connection. Titus regularly participated in three church congregations in Toronto and a fourth congregation in Niagara. He made friends with the people whom he met, then arranged travel for them, and they spread the news of his travel services to their acquaintances.[109] Titus generated his customer contact leads himself, and not through Skylight.[110] Titus maintained a manual client list (actually a book in which he kept track of his clients),[111] which he could have taken with him if he were to have left Skylight.[112]\n[122] Titus explained that in other contractor relationships of which he was aware, some travel agencies shared commissions with their contractors on a 50%\/50% basis or a 60%\/40% (in favour of the contractor) basis.[113] However in his situation, Titus appreciated that he was entitled to 70% of his earned commissions, while Skylight received 30%.[114] The fact that the commission\u2011sharing ratio applicable to Titus was more favourable to him than the ratio used in many other situations, and the fact that the amount of commissions earned was a function of the time and effort that he devoted to client development and other aspects of his work, indicate that he had an opportunity for profit.\n[123] This factor points strongly toward contractor status.\n(8) Weighing, Balancing and Resolving [124] To summarize, the control factor, the risk of loss factor and the opportunity for profit factor point strongly toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship between Skylight and Titus. The hiring of helpers factor points toward an employer\u2011employee relationship between Skylight and Titus. Although the tools and equipment factor points in both directions, it tilts toward contractor status. The responsibility for investment and management factor is not applicable in this situation.\n[125] Based on my review of the above factors, I have concluded that, overall, those factors support the position of Skylight and Titus, i.e., those factors are consistent with the mutual understanding that Titus worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. Furthermore, even if there was a lack of clarity concerning Titus\u2019 understanding of his relationship with Skylight, on balance, the Sagaz and Wiebe Door factors point toward contractor status. Accordingly, during the Relevant Period, Titus was not engaged in either insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[126] The Appeals are allowed, the Assessments in respect of Suresh (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-443(EI) and No. 2019-441(CPP)) are vacated, the Assessments in respect of Titus (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-450(EI) and No. 2019-451(CPP)) are vacated, and the Assessments in respect of Skylight (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-454(EI) and No. 2019-456(CPP)) are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that, during the Relevant Period:\n(a)neither Suresh nor Titus was engaged in insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight;\n(b)Selvy was engaged in pensionable employment, but not insurable employment, with Skylight; and\n(c)Sheela and Akhill were engaged in both insurable employment and pensionable employment with Skylight.\n[127] As neither the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Employment Insurance Act nor the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Canada Pension Plan provide for costs, I am not making any ruling or award in respect of the costs of these Appeals.\n[128] There were six Notices of Appeal that were the subject of the trial, i.e., an EI Notice of Appeal and a CPP Notice of Appeal for each of Skylight, Suresh and Titus. Those Notices of Appeal were drafted by an agent, on behalf of the Appellants, at a time before the Appellants had retained counsel.\n[129] In describing the relief sought, each of the six Notices of Appeal alleged that the particular Appellant\u2019s rights were violated by the conduct of a named employee of the CRA, and then went on to request that this Court award damages against the Minister for the unreasonable conduct of that employee. The granting of such relief is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court; therefore, I have ignored this particular claim for relief. Although this type of relief is beyond my jurisdiction, and notwithstanding the shortcomings in the various Reports prepared by the Officers (as indicated above), I will note that I found the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer to be courteous and polite, as well as sincere, respectful and moderate in the manner in which they approached the duties of their employment. These comments are intended only to provide my impression of the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer in respect of their appearance as witnesses in the trial of these Appeals. If the Appellants decide to pursue their claim for damages in a court that does have jurisdiction to grant such relief, my comments in this paragraph should not be construed as in any way addressing the evidence or the issues that may come before that court.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 28th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDon R.

Overview: [1] This is a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) matter, involving Canadian resource property (CRP) as defined in the federal Income Tax Act (Act).[1]\n[2] In 2008, the Appellant DEML Investments Limited\u2019s parent corporation paid $50,688,330 to acquire the shares of a corporation holding a 99% interest in a partnership of which it was a partner. The partnership held resource property primarily consisting of petroleum and natural gas (PNG) rights, which constitute CRP, and as well depreciable property. After several admitted avoidance transactions, by January 30, 2009 the resource property held by the Appellant was valued at $59,363,463. As well, in relation to that resource property the Appellant now had continuation of entitlement to approximately $47 million in resource tax pools.\n[3] By February 1, 2009, the Appellant\u2019s interest in the partnership had low value and an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $45,850,237. On November 30, 2010, the Appellant disposed of its partnership interest and accordingly claimed a $45,850,237 capital loss (Capital Loss), virtually all of which the Appellant sought to carry-back to offset a substantial capital gain reported in its 2007 taxation year.\n[4] The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) viewed the claimed Capital Loss as an artificial loss and denied it on the basis of GAAR. The Minister maintains that various admitted avoidance transactions involving the CRP of the resource property resulted in abuse or misuse of provisions of the Act, including capital loss and \u201cbump\u201d provisions, thus justifying the appealed GAAR reassessments of the Appellant\u2019s 2010 and 2007 taxation years.[2]\n[5] The Appellant admits that certain transactions relating to the said resource property primarily consisting of CRP were avoidance transactions, and pursuant to section 245 of the Act the claimed Capital Loss (and carry-back) was a tax benefit. The Appellant says however that no avoidance transactions abused or misused any provisions of the Act, and thus the appealed reassessments are wrong.\n[6] Provisions of the Act referred to herein are reproduced in the annex to these reasons for judgment.\nII. Issue: [7] The issue is whether any avoidance transaction(s) in this matter circumvented, defeated or frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of any provisions of the Act, so as to justify the Minister\u2019s application of GAAR in denying the Appellant\u2019s 2010 Capital Loss and carry-back to 2007 to offset a capital gain.\nIII. Evidence: [8] At the hearing, the parties tendered an agreed statement of facts and true copies of relevant documentation, without oral testimony.\n[9] The pertinent facts are the following, including agreement as to the tax benefit and seven avoidance transactions:\n-the Appellant during its 2007 to 2010 taxation years was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Direct Energy), a Canadian energy company;\n-in its 2007 taxation year, the Appellant reported a substantial capital gain;\n-in early 2008, Direct Energy chose to acquire certain Canadian oil and gas properties (Resource Properties) owned by Transglobe Energy Corporation (Transglobe), an international exploration and production company based in Calgary;\n-the Resource Properties consisted of:\n(a) PNG rights, which constituted CRP;\n(b) tangible property used to produce oil and natural gas, which constituted depreciable property as defined in the Act and classified as Class 41 property; and\n(c) miscellaneous interests of nominal value consisting of property necessary to operate the Resource Properties;\n-at all relevant times Direct Energy and Transglobe dealt with each other at arm\u2019s length;\n-in early 2008, Direct Energy entered into an agreement with Transglobe to acquire the Resource Properties. To implement the agreement, Direct Energy and Transglobe arranged and undertook certain pre\u2011acquisition transactions (Steps 1 to 4, following);\n- Step 1: on January 28, 2008 and March 25, 2008 respectively, Transglobe caused incorporation of two numbered companies that were wholly-owned subsidiaries, being 1377116 Alberta Ltd. (137) and 1389673 Alberta Ltd. (138);\n- Step 2: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on April 22, 2008, 137 and 138 formed the Transglobe Energy Partnership (DERP2);\n- Step 3: Transglobe transferred 99% of the Resource Properties to 137 and the remaining 1% to 138. The parties elected per subsection 85(1) of the Act re these transfers;\n- Step 4: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) 137 and 138 transferred the Resource Properties to their DERP2 partnership. They and DERP2 elected per subsection 97(2) of the Act re these transfers, at costs of $1 for the CRP and $11.3 million for the depreciable property;\n- Step 5: on April 30, 2008 Direct Energy acquired from Transglobe the shares of 137 and 138 for $56.7 million less adjustments, for a net purchase price of $51,200,333 broken down as follows - $50,688,330 for the shares of 137 and $512,003 for the shares of 138. Immediately following, Direct Energy\u2019s ACB of its shares of 137 was $50,688,330;\n- Steps 6 to 10 include the wind-up of 137 and transfer of the Resource Properties from DERP2;\n- Step 6: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on January 28, 2009, Direct Energy transferred its shares of 137 to the Appellant. They elected per subsection 85(1) of the Act re the roll-over transfer. The Appellant acquired the shares of 137 at a cost of $50,688,330 (equal to Direct Energy\u2019s ACB in the shares). At that time, the fair market value of the shares of 137 was $55,068,750;\n- Step 7: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on the following day, January 29, 2009, 137 distributed to the Appellant its property, consisting of its 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership, with an ACB of $11.3 million. Then 137 was wound-up and dissolved;\n- Step 8: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on the following day, January 30, 2009, the Appellant made a \u201cbump\u201d designation under paragraph 88(1)(d) of the Act for its acquisition of the 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership. The Appellant relied on this designation to claim a $39,402,330 increase (from $11,286,000 to the said $50,688,330) to its cost of acquisition, i.e. ACB, of the 99% designated interest in the DERP2 partnership. The Appellant also was deemed to be the same corporation and a continuation of 137 for the purpose of the Resource Properties. The Appellant increased its cumulative Canadian oil and gas property expenses (CCOGPE) tax pool by $34,859,099 and its UCC by $11,286,000;\n- Step 9: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on January 30, 2009, DERP2 distributed the Resource Properties to the Appellant as a return of capital of $59,363,463. This was the then fair market value of the Resource Properties. Of that amount $41,512,833 was allocated to the PNG rights, i.e. CRP; $12,112,166 to the Class 41 depreciable property; $3,783,463 to working capital and $1 to miscellaneous interests. This distribution reduced the Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest by the said fair market value (from $50,688,431 to $(8,675,032)).[3] The Appellant\u2019s CCOGPE balance was increased by the fair market value of the PNG rights;[4]\n- on January 31, 2009, being DERP2\u2019s fiscal year end, DERP2\u2019s proceeds of distribution for the CRP (the PNG rights) was allocated to its partners. The Appellant\u2019s CCOGPE balance was reduced by $43,077,705. The Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest increased by the said $43,077,705 to the amount of $34,402,673;\n- Step 10: on the next day, February 1, 2009, the Appellant transferred the assets it acquired from DERP2 to another partnership (LP1). Following this transfer the Appellant held a minority interest in LP1. The remaining interests in LP1 were held by persons related to the Appellant;\n- between June and October 2010, Direct Energy decided to divest itself of certain of the Resource Properties that were located in the Redwater district (Redwater Properties). To effect sale of the Redwater Properties, the Appellant arranged for undertaking of the following transactions (Steps 11 and 12). At all relevant times the Appellant and the intended purchaser, Orion Oil & Gas Corporation (Orion), dealt with each other at arm\u2019s length;\n- Step 11: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on November 29, 2010, LP1 transferred the Redwater Properties (valued at $6.7 million) to the Appellant. The Appellant in turn transferred the Redwater Properties back into DERP2. The Appellant and DERP2 elected per subsection 97(2) of the Act respecting that transfer. As a result of the transfer, the Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest increased by approx. $6.7 million;\n- Step 12: on November 30, 2010, the Appellant sold to Orion its DERP2 partnership interest and its shares in 138, for a base purchase price of $6.7 million;\n- for its 2010 taxation year the Appellant reported the aforesaid Capital Loss of $45,850,237, from disposition of its DERP2 partnership interest. The Appellant had reported an ACB in the DERP2 partnership interest of $52,550,237 and proceeds of disposition of $6.7 million;\n- the Appellant \u201ccarried back\u201d and deducted in computing its taxable income for its 2007 taxation year $44,879,994 of the Capital Loss, as a net capital loss from its 2010 taxation year, to offset the capital gain the Appellant had reported in its 2007 taxation year;\n- the Minister on reassessment determined the Capital Loss to be nil and reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2007 taxation year to deny the deduction of the net capital loss in that taxation year from the 2010 taxation year;\n- the deduction by the Appellant in computing taxable income for the 2007 taxation year of a portion ($44,879,994) of the Capital Loss is a tax benefit (Tax Benefit) as defined under subsection 245(1) of the Act.\n- Direct Energy had a business purpose for agreeing to acquire the Resource Properties: their production and development potential were geographically adjacent to Direct Energy\u2019s core properties, and the properties were geologically similar to Direct Energy\u2019s core assets, primarily conventional natural gas;\n- the parties agree that each of the transactions described at Step 2, Step 4, Step 6, Step 7, Step 8, Step 9 and Step 11 above:\na. resulted directly or indirectly, alone or as part of a series of transactions, in the Tax Benefit;\nb. was arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit;\nc. may not reasonably be considered to be a transaction undertaken or arranged primarily for a purpose other than to obtain the Tax Benefit; and\nd. is an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d per subsection 245(3) of the Act.\nIV. GAAR: [10] Section 245 of the Act (the GAAR provision) provides as follows (excluding subsection (1) definitions except for \u201ctax benefit\u201d):\n245(1) \u201ctax benefit\u201d means reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act, and includes a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount that would be payable under this Act but for a tax treaty or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act as a result of a tax treaty;\n245(2) General anti-avoidance provision [GAAR] - where a transaction is an avoidance transaction, the tax consequences to a person shall be determined, as is reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny a tax benefit that, but for this section, would result, directly, or indirectly, from that transaction, or from a series of transactions that includes that transaction.\n245(3) Avoidance transaction - an avoidance transaction means any transaction\n(a) that, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit; or\n(b) that is partly of a series of transactions, which series, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.\n245(4) Application of subsection (2) - Subsection 2 applies to a transaction only if it may reasonably be considered that the transaction\n(a) would, if this Act were read without reference to this section, result directly or indirectly in a misuse of the provisions of any one or more of\n(i) this Act, (ii) the Income Tax Regulations, (iii) the Income Tax Application Rules, (iv) a tax treaty, or (v) any other enactment that is relevant in computing tax or any other amount payable by or refundable to a person under this act or in determining any amount that is relevant for the purposes of that computation; or\n(b) would result directly or indirectly in an abuse having regard to those provisions, other than this section, read as a whole.\nV. Issue and Parties\u2019 Positions: [11] As stated, the sole issue is whether per paragraph 245(4) any avoidance transaction(s) undertaken or arranged to achieve the Tax Benefit resulted directly or indirectly in abuse or misuse of any provision(s) of the Act.\n[12] Answering this is a two-step process \u2013 first, to determine the object, spirit and purpose (OSP) of relevant provisions of the Act through a unified textual, contextual and purposive approach; and second, to determine whether an avoidance transaction or series of avoidance transactions frustrated or defeated the OSP of relevant provisions of the Act.\n[13] The Appellant submits that its position is justified by the Act\u2019s resource rules, stating that they applied as intended and that the legislative text supports three \u201ckey points\u201d. These points are:\n(a) CRP is neither capital property, nor inventory, therefore it receives its own special treatment under the Act;\n(b) the cost associated with acquiring CRP is not tied to the property itself, but allocated to certain resource tax pools. CRP does not have an ACB associated with it. When a taxpayer acquires or disposes of CRP, the tax pools\u2019 balances accordingly increase or decrease; and\n(c) when CRP is owned by a partnership, the costs associated with that property are tracked at the partner level, not at the partnership level.[5]\n[14] Also, the Appellant cites CRA Ruling 2005\u20130147681R3 entitled \u201cTransfer of Canadian Resource Properties\u201d, which the Appellant says presents a similar series of transactions to those herein, and then concluding that the GAAR would not apply. The 2005 Ruling states also that it, \u201cmay not represent the current position of the CRA.\u201d[6]\nVI. Resource Property Provisions: [15] The Act provides for differing regimes in recognizing costs incurred to acquire differing types of properties. Three such regimes are relevant in this matter, in determining whether there was statutory abuse in a GAAR context. They are:\n(a) the capital gain\/loss regime which relates to acquisition costs of capital property;\n(b) the CCA regime which is pertinent to acquisition costs of depreciable property; and\n(c) the CCOGPE tax pools regime, pertinent to acquisition costs of Canadian resource property, i.e. CRP.\n[16] Costs pertaining to CRP acquisitions are added to the CCOGPE tax pool. The concept of ACB, applicable in the context of capital property, does not apply to CRP acquisition costs, as CRP is not capital property, per the section 54 definition of \u201ccapital property\u201d and subparagraphs 39(1)(a)(ii) and 39(1)(b)(ii).\n[17] The CCOGPE tax pool (one of three tax pools) is established by paragraphs 66.4(5)(a) and (b) of the Act. CRP costs allocated to this pool include costs of acquiring CRP relevant to the oil and gas industry such as for land, licences, permits, exploration rights, leases, wells and royalty interests. This includes the PNG rights relevant in this appeal; with CRP being a prominent portion of the Resource Properties.\n[18] The Appellant asserts that CRP triggers special treatment. As stated, CRP does not have an ACB associated with it as it is not capital property pursuant to section 54 and subparagraphs 39(1)(a)(ii) and 39(1)(b)(ii). The latter two provisions also provide that no capital gain or loss can be realized on property that is CRP.[7]\n[19] Also, the Appellant notes that CRP is not depreciable property, due to subsection 13(21) which limits depreciable property to being property for which capital cost allowance may be claimed under paragraph 20(1)(a).[8]\n[20] The Appellant submits that as CRP is not capital property and no ACB may be associated with it, the cost of acquiring CRP is instead recognized by way of tax pools, in particular the CCOGPE tax pool. Per paragraph 66.4(2)(b) a taxpayer\u2019s CCOGPE balance is deductible in calculating a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year on a 10 percent declining balance. When CRP is disposed of, the taxpayer\u2019s CCOGPE balance is reduced by the amount of proceeds of disposition of the CRP.\nVII. Analysis: [21] The Respondent submits that capital loss provisions of the Act were abused. The Respondent asserts that the Appellant, in claiming the Capital Loss, claimed an artificial or paper loss, and not a real loss.\n[22] The Appellant refutes that submission, saying there was no abuse and that the claimed Capital Loss arose due to \u201cthe unique features of the resource rules [which] specifically contemplate different tax results than are available in any other regime in the Act.\u201d[9]\n[23] The Respondent submits also that the \u201cbump\u201d rules in the Act were abused.\n[24] The Appellant responds that the \u201cbump\u201d rules in the Act were applied as intended.\n[25] In the recent decision of Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that GAAR was added to the Act (in 1988) due to \u201cabusive tax avoidance\u201d brought on by \u201ccreative tax planners.\u201d\n[26] Rowe J., writing the 7\/1 majority opinion in Deans Knight, referenced this as follows (underlining added):[10]\n42. [Prior to the GAAR coming into force in 1988]\u2026abusive tax avoidance had become a problem of significant concern for Parliament. Taxpayers, aided by expert advice, increasingly devised complex legal transactions to avoid tax in ways unintended by Parliament. Once the avoidance mechanisms relied on became evident, either from advance ruling requests or tax assessments, Parliament would react to \u2018plug\u2019 the loopholes in the [Income Tax] Act to prevent future use. The problem was that increasingly convoluted rules were vulnerable, creating new loopholes to exploit\u2026. As this \u2018cycle of action and reaction\u2019 between creative tax planners and Parliament continued, the Act grew in size and complexity\u2026\n44. The GAAR was Parliament\u2019s chosen mechanism to interrupt this cycle...\n[27] The GAAR, \u201cconfers\u2026the unusual duty of going beyond the words of the legislation\u201d in applying the three-step GAAR analysis, described as follows:[11]\n51. \u2026\u2018[i]t is relatively straightforward to set out the GAAR scheme. It is much more difficult to apply it\u2019\u2026 This is because the GAAR confers upon courts the \u2018unusual duty of going behind the words of the legislation\u2019... While the duty imposed by the GAAR is unusual, the analysis involves a structured, three-step test that has been the subject of thorough guidance by this Court. In order for the GAAR to apply, the following questions must be asked\u2026 (1) Was there a tax benefit? (2) Was the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit an avoidance transaction? (3) Was the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit abusive?\n52. \u2026at the third step, the Minister bears the burden of proving that the avoidance transaction results in an abuse. (underlining added)\n[28] Regarding the first of these three questions (was there a tax benefit?), the parties agree that the Appellant\u2019s claimed deduction for its 2007 taxation year of $44,879,994 of the total $45,850,237 Capital Loss from its disposition in its 2010 taxation year of its DERP2 partnership interest, is the Tax Benefit per subsection 245(1) of the Act.[12]\n[29] As for the second question (was the transaction giving rise to the Tax Benefit an avoidance transaction?), the parties concur that seven of the twelve transactional steps as set out above were avoidance transactions \u2013 being steps 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The parties accept, per the subsection 245(3) definition of avoidance transaction, that each of these avoidance transactions was arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit, i.e. the Capital Loss claimed by the Appellant.\n[30] It is the third of these questions (was\/were the avoidance transaction(s) that gave rise to the Tax Benefit abusive?) that is at issue herein.\n[31] In Deans Knight Rowe, J. addressed this third stage question in applying the GAAR as follows (under the heading, \u201cThe Abuse Analysis Focuses on Whether the Result of the Transactions Frustrates the Provision\u2019s Object, Spirit and Purpose\u201d):\nAt the abuse stage, the avoidance transactions will be abusive where the outcome or result of the avoidance transaction \u2018(a) is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; (b) defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions relied on; or (c) circumvents certain provisions in a manner that frustrates the object, spirit and purpose of those provisions\u2019 (Lipson, at para. 40, citing Trustco, at para. 45). These considerations are not independent of one another and frequently overlap (Copthorne, at para. 72). Ultimately, the analysis remains squarely focused on abuse. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction \u201cmust be clear\u201d (Trustco, at paras. 62 and 66; Copthorne, at para. 68; Alta Energy, at para. 33).[13] (underlining added)\n[32] Also, it was made clear that the GAAR may apply regardless of precisely worded provisions:\nImportantly, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule. Thus, I do not agree with the appellant\u2019s submission that where Parliament has legislated with precision, as here, where loss carryovers are denied in specific instances, the GAAR is not meant to play a role. Of course, the GAAR will not apply in all circumstances - the analysis is inherently case specific. Further, the way a provision has been drafted is important within the text, context and purpose analysis, since it may shed light on the conduct that Parliament sought to target and how it went about doing so. But the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s.245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules were being circumvented through abusive tax planning, and that such rules were among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions\u2026[14] (underlining added)\n[33] Rowe J. added:[15]\nIn summary, at the third stage of the GAAR analysis:\n-The object spirit and purpose is a description of the provision\u2019s underlying rationale. The means (the how) do not always provide a full answer as to the rationale underlying the provision (the why).\n-The text, context and purpose of a provision provide indicia of its rationale. The text can shed light on what the provision was designed to encourage or prevent based on what it expressly permits or restricts, how it is worded and structured, and the nature of the provision. Similarly, the context can serve to identify the function of the provision within a coherent scheme.\n-Finally, the provision\u2019s purpose can help to discern the outcomes that Parliament sought to achieve or prevent.\n-Once the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis goes beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions to consider whether the result frustrates the provision\u2019s rationale. (underlining added)\nVIII. Assertions of abuse: [34] The Respondent asserts two categories of abuse of provisions of the Act. The first abuse assertion is in respect of certain capital loss provisions of the Act. The second is in respect of \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act utilized to increase the ACB of the Appellant\u2019s DERP2 partnership interest, enabling increase of the claimed Capital Loss.\n[35] I first address the claimed abuse of capital loss provisions of the Act that were applied to obtain the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit. The capital loss provisions of the Act said to have been abused are paragraphs 3(b), 38(b) and 11(b), subparagraphs 39(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and definitions \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8).[16]\n[36] As noted, there are two parts to the abuse analysis. The first is establishment of the OSP of the statutory provisions at issue. The second is establishment that one or more avoidance transactions of the Appellant abused the OSP of those provisions.\n[37] In Triad Gestco Ltd. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 258, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) accepted the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive analysis\u201d of the specified capital loss provisions, as follows:\n50. Addressing this question, Justice Paris in the companion case conducted a textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the provisions relied upon by the appellant in order to obtain the tax benefit (1207192 Ontario Ltd., paras. 63 to 68 and 84 to 93). He properly identified each of the relevant provisions and their reason for being. I agree with his conclusion that these provisions, in particular paragraph 38(b), provide relief as an offset against capital gain where a taxpayer has suffered an economic loss on the disposition of property. I also agree with his further conclusion that offsetting a capital gain with the paper loss that was claimed results in an abuse and a misuse of the relevant provisions, specifically paragraphs 38(b), 39(1)(b) and 40(1)(b) (1207192 Ontario Ltd., paras. 92 and 93).\n51. The appellant correctly points out that the words \u201ceconomic loss\u201d on which Justice Paris relied in identifying the underlying rationale do not appear in any of the relevant provisions. However, there is no objection at this stage of the analysis to departing from the bare meaning of the words provided that the reading proposed is supported by a textual, contextual and purposive reading of the relevant provisions (Copthorne Holdings, para. 70). Given their purpose \u2013 i.e. to tax the net realized increase in the value of capital assets - it is not possible, in my view, to read the relevant provisions otherwise. (underlining added)\n[38] The capital loss provisions addressed in Triad Gestco (paragraphs 38(b), 39(1)(b) and 40(1)(b)) are included in the capital loss provisions that in this appeal the Crown has claimed were abused (sections 3, 38, 39, 40, 53 and 54). The underlying rationale of the capital loss provisions identified in Triad Gestco is that a capital loss offsetting a capital gain is to be reflective of \u201can economic loss on the disposition of property\u201d. That is, the loss cannot be an artificial or paper loss.\n[39] Here the Minister determined there was no real or economic loss, as stated in the Respondent\u2019s written submissions, paragraph 170, as follows:\n170. The appellant\u2019s capital loss does not reflect any kind of impoverishment on the part of the appellant. The entire capital loss relies on ACB from transactions that occurred in a period \u2013 the period from April 2008 until January 30, 2009 - during which the Resource Properties increased in value by $8,675,133 from the price paid by Direct Energy for the shares in 137. All of the price paid by Direct Energy for those shares was indirectly attributable to the Resource Properties. During this period there were no transactions involving the appellant and DERP2 other than those involving the Resource Properties. At the end of the period, the appellant held the Resource Properties at a value of over $59 million.[17] [underlining added]\n[40] As indicated by this statement, the Respondent observes that while the Appellant claimed the Capital Loss of some $45 million, at the same time the value of the Resource Properties, held by the Appellant, had increased by over $8 million from when purchased by the Appellant\u2019s parent Direct Energy, to an amount exceeding $59 million. This does not indicate there having been any loss, let alone one of some $45 million.\n[41] The Appellant asserts that, for resource properties, gain or loss is not based on any particular resource property but rather \u201con a pool-wide basis by increasing or decreasing CCOGPE as the case may be.\u201d[18]\n[42] That is so, however I do not accept that that constrains a GAAR analysis from viewing the pertinent circumstances in a general and common-sense basis.\n[43] The Appellant did not show that the claimed Capital Loss (i.e., the Tax Benefit) was a real loss, as opposed to being an artificial or paper loss. To the contrary, the Capital Loss was reflective of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest that per Step 8 had been substantially \u201cbumped\u201d per paragraph 88(1)(d). That does not reflect any actual as opposed to paper loss. The Appellant acknowledges that this Step 8 was an avoidance transaction, and as such, \u201cwas arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit.\u201d[19]\n[44] Thus, I conclude that the Appellant has claimed an artificial loss, rather than a true loss, not abiding by the OSP of the capital loss provisions of the Act, as pronounced by the FCA in Triad Gestco. Also, it is apparent that the approx. $51 million that Direct Energy paid for the shares of 137 would be due to the value of the 99% interest in the Resource Properties that 137 held, most all of which was CRP, and which by January 30, 2009 had increased in value to more than $59 million. That certainly is not indicative of any loss.\n[45] This breach of the OSP of capital loss provisions of the Act is a clear abuse of those provisions \u2013 i.e., paragraphs 3(b), 38(b), 39(1)(b), 40(1)(b) and 111(1)(b), the definition \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8). Consistent with the OSP of these provisions, these provisions are abused when utilized in respect of artificial or paper losses as opposed to real losses.\n[46] The Appellant refutes the proposition that it abused the capital gain\/loss provisions of the Act. The Appellant submits that the loss pertaining to its claimed Capital Loss is due to the \u201cunique\u201d provisions in the Act respecting CRP. The provisions \u201cspecifically contemplate different tax results than are available in any other regime in the Act.\u201d[20]\n[47] GAAR, where the applicable OSP has been abused, should prevent a taxpayer from doing indirectly what cannot be done directly. Applying the GAAR turns on viewing what has actually happened. Here the substantial Capital Loss was claimed where there was no economic loss or impoverishment, thus per Triad Gestco breaching the OSP of the Act\u2019s capital loss provisions, including paragraph 39(1)(b).\n[48] In that context it is abusive where a capital loss nevertheless was claimed based on the value of a partnership interest, which value derives from the CRP (of the Resource Properties) while held by that partnership. So here, CRP was made indirectly the basis for the claimed capital loss. As said, this is tax planning to do indirectly what cannot be done directly, and GAAR exists to deal with such situations.\n[49] Furthermore, on November 30, 2010 when the DERP2 partnership interest was disposed of, creating the subject Capital Loss, the agreed statement of facts indicates that the Appellant continued to own the Resource Properties (minus a portion referenced as the Redwater Properties), acquired from the DERP2 partnership a year earlier (Step 9). Thus, the Appellant remained entitled to the CCOGPE and UCC tax pools pertaining to the Resource Properties while also enjoying an increase in the value of the Resource Properties of more than $8 million. This is all while the Appellant was seeking to benefit from the carry\u2011back to 2007 of most of the claimed Capital Loss \u2013 which was a paper loss only \u2013 to offset the substantial capital gain reported in that year.\n[50] I find that is abusive of the capital loss provisions, which are not intended to be useable for CRP based value, particularly while at the same time there remains entitlement to the CCOGPE and UCC tax pools. That appears why the Act does not want CRP involved with claimed capital losses. The CCOPEG cost regime applies to CRP; not either the capital loss\/gain cost regime or CCA cost regimes.\n[51] The Appellant cites also the above-mentioned CRA Ruling - # 2005\u20110147681R3. In this Ruling, issued in 2006, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) held that a partnership that no longer owned certain resource properties, which generated a high ACB, could still preserve that ACB. However, in that Ruling the CRA did not take a position with regards to claimed capital losses on a partnership interest in such a partnership, which is the situation in the present matter. Nor did the Ruling deal with ACB that had been \u201cbumped\u201d for the purposes of increasing a capital loss to be applied against a previously reported capital gain.\n[52] Furthermore, the FCA has warned that prior rulings and opinions provided by the CRA are \u201cof little assistance\u201d in GAAR cases. The courts are not bound by the opinion of the Minister or CRA. Determining the object, spirit and purpose of a provision is a question of law and is the sole responsibility of the courts.[21]\n[53] The series of avoidance transactions defeats the underlying rationale of the capital loss provisions by carrying back a loss where there is no economic loss. Following Triad Gestco there is abuse where a capital loss is carried back without any corresponding economic loss.\n[54] Of particular note, in 2763478 Canada Inc. v. Canada, 2018 FCA 209, the FCA wrote:\nThe appellant points out that the phrases \u201cpaper loss\u201d and \u201ceconomic\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d loss appear nowhere in the ITA\u2026 That is so, but as the Supreme Court explained in Copthorne (paragraph 70), construction focused on the object, spirit and purpose of a provision may give it a broader meaning than a construction which focuses on the words (to the same effect, see Triad Gestco, at paragraph 51). When one considers the object, spirit and purpose of the capital gains regime, it seems clear that allowing a paper loss to offset a true gain would frustrate its reason for being.[22] [emphasis added]\n[55] The Appellant argues that Triad Gestco should be distinguished in favour of the reasoning applied in Donahue Forest Products Inc.[23] As a matter of jurisprudence, the Triad Gestco decision is quite more recent. In Donahue, the FCA affirms that there is \u201cnothing in the Act that bars the taxpayer from realizing a loss on the sale of shares to arm\u2019s length of third parties, even if a significant portion of the assets to which the loss on the shares may be attributed remains within the group of corporations.\u201d However, unlike the present fact situation, in Donohue there was a true economic loss - following the collapse of the price of wood pulp, Donahue Inc.\u2019s investment became worthless. This crucial distinction as to real versus false loss, calls for, in the present case, the application of Triad Gestco rather than Donohue.\n[56] As the purpose of the capital loss provisions is to recognize real losses, there is clear abuse where artificial losses are deducted. That is even more so when those losses are based on non-capital CRP, that will also be deducted through CCOGPE pools at a 100% inclusion rate thus creating a double deduction. As the Appellant stated, CRP is not capital property and does not have an ACB \u2013 therefore, how can it be the economic basis for a capital loss.\n[57] The avoidance transactions at issue undermine the integrity of the capital gains and loss scheme of the Act, in addition to benefitting from the CCOGPE tax pool.\n[58] Accordingly, I conclude that from a GAAR perspective that in this matter there was abuse of the identified capital loss provisions arising from the avoidance transactions.\n[59] I now address the Respondent\u2019s second abuse submission, that avoidance transactions undertaken to achieve the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit, through augmenting the ACB of the Appellant\u2019s DERP2 partnership interest, abused provisions of the Act. The provisions are paragraphs 88(1)(b), (c) and (d), subparagraphs 39(1)(b)(i) and (ii), paragraphs 3(b), 38(b) and 111(b) and the definitions \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8), subparagraph 53(1)(e)(viii), section 66.4 and subsection 66(13) of the Act.\n[60] The subsection 88(1) \u201cbump\u201d provisions are described in Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30 at paragraph 76, 77 and 78, as follows:\n76. In vertical amalgamation, paragraph 88(1)(a) deems the parent corporation to have acquired the property of its subsidiary at the subsidiary\u2019s tax cost. Prior to the wind-up, however, it is possible that the parent\u2019s tax cost of the shares in its subsidiary (the ACB of the shares) will exceed the tax cost of the subsidiary\u2019s underlying property. Upon a vertical amalgamation, these shares will disappear. Without further adjustment, the tax cost in those shares would also disappear, thereby giving rise to potential double taxation in the event that the underlying property is subsequently sold. This is because the deemed cost of the underlying property in the hands of the parent, being equal to the subsidiary\u2019s tax cost, would not reflect any appreciation in value up to the time of the wind-up.\n77. The bump provided for in paragraphs 88(1)(c) and (d) rectifies this situation by first calculating the difference between the ACB of the parent\u2019s shares and the tax cost of the subsidiary\u2019s property. This amount is then allowed to be added to the tax cost of the non-depreciable capital property which the parent inherited from its subsidiary. In other words, the tax cost of this property is bumped. The bump essentially allows any ACB that would otherwise be lost on a vertical amalgamation to be preserved and transferred to different property that is taxed the same way.\n78. Subparagraph 88(1)(c)(iii) prohibits the parent from bumping the cost of \u201cineligible property\u201d which includes depreciable property. The issue the bumps seeks to address is the disappearance of the shares and the tax cost (the shares\u2019 ACB) embedded therein. Preserving and transferring ACB that would otherwise be lost to an asset that is taxed with the same rate of inclusion is the way in which this is accommodated. Allowing property that is taxed on the basis of a 50% rate of inclusion to augment the value of property that is taxed on the basis of a 100% rate of inclusion would result in an obvious revenue loss. That explains why depreciable property or other types of property that give rise to a 100% rate of inclusion cannot be bumped.\n[61] In this matter, 137 was the wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent the Appellant. Per Step 7, being an avoidance transaction, on January 29, 2009 137 distributed its property (99% interest in DERRP2 partnership) to its parent the Appellant. 137 was then wound-up and dissolved.\n[62] The Step 8 avoidance transaction closely followed, whereby the Appellant made a paragraph 88(1)(d) designation respecting its acquisition from 137 of the 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership. This \u201cbump\u201d designation of the capital property allowed the Appellant to claim a $39,402,330 increase to the cost at which it had acquired the said partnership interest. The cost thus ACB went from $11,286,101 to $50,688,431. And then on the following day, January 30, 2009, DERP2 distributed the Resource Properties to the Appellant.\n[63] Paragraph 88(1)(c) sets out the basic eligibility criteria for the bump (also known as the bump denial rules). These rules include that the property must be capital property of the subsidiary at the time the parent acquired control of the subsidiary. CRP is specifically excluded from capital property, per subparagraph 39(1)(b)(ii). Thus, CRP cannot be bumped. The property must not be \u201cineligible property\u201d, such as depreciable property.[24]\n[64] But for the bump rules, the parent\u2019s tax cost in the subsidiary\u2019s shares would disappear on the wind-up and the parent would lose that positive tax attribute to shelter future capital gains.\n[65] Note that subparagraph 88(1)(d)(ii.1) was introduced in 2013, well after the transactions relating to this present appeal. This anti-avoidance provision ended the practice of bumping ACBs of partnership interests where the fair market value of the partnership was derived from ineligible assets, such as depreciable property or CRP.\n[66] The FCA examined the object, spirit, and purpose of paragraph 88(1)(d) in the Queen v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30. In that case, the taxpayer undertook a complex series of transactions, which involved rolling three real estate properties, through a tiered partnership structure, increasing (bumping) the ACB of the partnership interest and selling the partnership interests to tax-exempt entities without tax being paid on the latent recapture, and accrued gains in the property being held by the partnerships. Essentially, the taxpayer avoided latent recapture under subsection 100(1) and eliminated capital gains on the sale of their partnership interests.\n[67] To my mind there is a ready answer as to whether the \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act have been abused in the circumstances at bar. It was the \u201cbump\u201d of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest that led to the very substantial increase of the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit, while not reflective of any real loss as discussed above. Thus, as concluded above, the capital gain\/loss provisions of the Act were abused or misused.\n[68] The primary tool for doing this was the \u201cbump\u201d mechanism of the Act, causing the increasing of ACBs. It thus appears obvious that likewise the \u201cbump\u201d provisions in subsection 88(1) of the Act were abused, for having been the legislative tool used for creation of the artificial loss reflected by the Capital Loss.\n[69] I note also that the \u201cbump\u201d provisions well fit the category of capital loss provisions of the Act. After all, it is the ACB that is \u201cbumped\u201d; and the ACB is a primary factor in the determination of the amount of a capital gain or loss. Thus the \u201cno artificial loss\u201d OSP of capital loss provisions of the Act encompass also the subsection 88(1) \u201cbump\u201d provisions. Hence, in the context of a GAAR analysis, abuse of these provisions would include the \u201cbump\u201d provisions where the ACB was \u201cbumped\u201d in creation of the artificial loss here underlying the Capital Loss leading to the Tax Benefit.\n[70] Put another way, it seems incomprehensible that an artificial loss would signal misuse of capital loss provisions of the Act without equally indicating misuse of the very \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act used to achieve the artificial loss through the \u201cbumping\u201d of an ACB.\n[71] I accordingly find that the identified \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act were likewise misused by the avoidance transactions leading to and including the \u201cbumped\u201d enhancement of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest, to enable the Appellant to claim in 2010 the Capital Loss sufficiently sized to be carried\u2011back and set-off against the Appellant\u2019s 2007 capital gain.\nIX. Conclusion: [72] In conclusion, I have found that both of the Respondent\u2019s claims of statutory misuse in a GAAR context have been made out. That being the sole issue, the appeal will be denied, with costs.\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated February 29, 2024, in order to correct the words underscored in paragraphs 5, 9, 10, 18, 36 and 72 hereof.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 11th day of March 2024.\n\u201cB.

Introduction\n[1] The Minister of National Revenue denied Michelle Adams\u2019 application for the disability tax credit (DTC) on the basis that her celiac disease symptoms and treatment do not meet the relevant criteria under the Income Tax Act (Act).[1]\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Minister\u2019s decision. Ms. Adams does not qualify for the DTC because she does not have a marked restriction in feeding herself within the meaning of that term in the Act.\n[3] The DTC provisions specifically exclude activities related to managing dietary restrictions from the activity of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d. Moreover, the inability to absorb nutrients does not qualify as a marked restriction in feeding oneself, otherwise everyone with celiac disease would automatically qualify for the credit. Eligibility for the DTC is not based solely on the existence of a medical condition; taxpayers must still establish a resulting marked restriction in an activity of daily living.\nII. Background\n[4] Ms. Adams applied for the DTC for the 2014 through 2021 taxation years, based on a diagnosis of celiac disease and the steps she takes to manage the disease.\n[5] For several years, Ms. Adams experienced severe stomach pains, fatigue, and vitamin B12 deficiencies. When she was first tested for celiac disease in 2014, the results were negative. After her symptoms persisted and worsened, she was tested again in 2021 and received a formal diagnosis on April 22, 2021. The diagnosis was considered effective as of 2014, after her 2014 samples were re\u2011tested.\n[6] After the diagnosis, Ms. Adams immediately stopped consuming gluten and conducted extensive research to understand celiac disease. Her gastroenterologist also referred her to a registered dietician for \u201cformal counseling on a gluten-free diet\u201d.\n[7] Ms. Adams applied for the DTC in the fall of 2021. Her family physician, Dr. Shawna Phillips, signed the required form on October 14, 2021 (Certificate).[2] In completing the Certificate, Dr. Phillips did not indicate that Ms. Adams was impaired in her ability to perform any of the listed daily activities of living. However, Dr. Phillips did certify that Ms. Adams required therapy to support a vital function, and attached a document prepared by Ms. Adams estimating the amount of time she requires to maintain a gluten-free diet. Dr. Phillips also referred to that same document instead of providing a description of Ms. Adams\u2019 impairment.\n[8] By Notice of Determination dated November 22, 2021, the Minister denied the application on the basis that Ms. Adams was not impaired in her ability to perform one or more activities of daily living, as required under paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) of the Act. The Minister also concluded that Ms. Adams did not require therapy, administered for an average of more than 14 hours per week, within the meaning of paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) and subsection 118.3(1.1).\n[9] In support of her appeal from the Minister\u2019s decision, Ms. Adams relied on a new certificate signed by Dr. Phillips, dated September 8, 2022 (Revised Certificate).[3] In the Revised Certificate, Dr. Phillips indicated that Ms. Adams was impaired in her ability to perform the daily activity of feeding herself.\n[10] In her testimony, Ms. Adams summarized her journey to obtain a diagnosis and manage her disease. She also provided the Court with background information that she learned through her extensive research on celiac disease.\n[11] That information was consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s description of celiac disease in its 2002 decision in Hamilton.[4] Celiac disease is a genetically based, permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in inflammatory damage to the small intestine. If untreated, it can result in severe malnutrition and increased risk of other diseases like lymphoma, osteoporosis, Type I diabetes and reproductive problems. The only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, effectively eliminating wheat, rye, barley, oats, or any products derived from these grains. Celiac disease does not require avoidance of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, or starches that do not contain gluten, such as rice, potatoes and corn. However, a gluten-free diet requires avoiding cross-contamination in processed foods and in food prepared by others, including at restaurants.\n[12] Ms. Adams\u2019 research highlighted the changes in how celiac disease has been recognized and treated since the 2002 Hamilton decision. For example, Health Canada began regulating the sale of food labelled as \u201cgluten-free\u201d in 2012.[5] Only those foods that have been specially processed or formulated to meet the needs of individuals who need to follow a gluten-free diet to protect their health can carry a gluten-free claim.\n[13] Unfortunately, Ms. Adams\u2019 research did not establish that the facts of her case, including her particular symptoms and the steps she takes to manage celiac disease, meet the requirements of the Act.\nIII. Analysis\n[14] The purpose of the DTC is to provide modest tax relief for individuals who fall within the restricted category of markedly physically or mentally impaired persons.[6] While the DTC provisions should be given a humane and compassionate interpretation, the Court cannot disregard clear statutory requirements and restrictions. Attention must be paid to the terms chosen by Parliament.[7]\n[15] The terms used in the DTC provisions have legal meanings that may not align with a layperson\u2019s understanding or even that of a medical professional.[8] For that reason, certification by a medical practitioner does not guarantee eligibility for the credit. This Court must still assess whether the legal requirements of the Act have been met.[9]\nA. The limited scope of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d\n[16] The outcome of this appeal turns on the meaning of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d, a term Parliament amended in 2003 to explicitly exclude the time required to identify, shop for, and prepare food, due to a dietary restriction or regime.[10]\n[17] The amendment was in response to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Hamilton.[11] In that matter, both this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal applied the general principle that \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d includes finding and preparing food that conforms to a medically prescribed diet.[12] Mr. Hamilton, who had to manage dietary restrictions related to celiac disease and diabetes,[13] required an inordinate amount of time to prepare his meals and feed himself compared to ordinary, healthy persons following a routine diet.[14]\n[18] In response, Parliament clarified and limited the scope of the activity of feeding oneself with the addition of the following paragraph to subsection 118.4(1):\n(e) feeding oneself does not include\n(i) any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food, or\n(ii) the activity of preparing food to the extent that the time associated with the activity would not have been necessary in the absence of a dietary restriction or regime;\n[19] In applying these amendments, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the excessive amount of time preparing food is no longer a factor to be considered.[15]\n[20] Ms. Adams\u2019 claim therefore must be considered within the parameters of those provisions. Based on the clear legislative criteria, I cannot conclude that she was markedly restricted in her ability to feed herself.\n1. Time required is not inordinate\n[21] Ms. Adams argued that she is markedly restricted because she requires an inordinate amount of time to feed herself. In support of this argument, she provided an estimate of time for several activities related to managing and treating her celiac disease through a 100% gluten-free diet:[16]\nActivity\nMinutes per week\nMinutes per day\nTreatment: consumption of gluten-free foods (3-5 times per day, 7 days per week)\n525\n75\nTreatment: consumption of vitamins\/supplements that body can\u2019t absorb due to celiac disease (calcium, B12 and Vitamin D) (Once per day, 7 days per week)\n35\n5\nPreparation of gluten-free foods (3-5 times per day, 7 days per week)\n630\n90\nCommunication with people hosting events \/ preparing food to bring to these events\n15\n2\nPreparation of gluten-free food for family and holiday gatherings (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas)\n15\n2\nCommunication with family\/friends in preparation of gatherings to ensure appropriate food is available\n15\n2\nSelf-education and educating others about celiac disease, gluten-free diet, cross-contamination, meal planning, shopping for gluten-free foods, reading labels\n20\nCommunication with restaurants\/staff when eating out about gluten-free food options and minimizing cross-contamination\n30\nReading labels of food items during each grocery visit to ensure items do not contain barley, rye, oats or wheat (gluten-free)\n120\nAttending celiac disease workshops (education, cooking, therapy and support)\n15\nMedical and nutrition appointments and communications\n5.76\nMedical testing\n12.69\nTime roommate spends reading labels for food brought into shared living space\n60\nTotal minutes per week managing\/treating celiac disease\n1498.5\nTotal hours per week\n24.97\n[22] As a preliminary issue, Ms. Adams\u2019 claim for the DTC for 2014 through 2020 cannot succeed because she did not undertake any of these activities until after her diagnosis in 2021.\n[23] The claim for 2021 cannot succeed because the majority of the activities do not fall within the meaning of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d as limited by paragraph 118.4(1)(e) cited above.\n[24] Time spent on preparation of gluten-free foods is excluded under subparagraph 118.4(1)(e)(ii) as \u201cthe activity of preparing food for a dietary restriction or regime\u201d. Time spent on reading food labels is excluded under subparagraph 188.4(1)(e)(i) as \u201cactivities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food\u201d.\n[25] The following activities also cannot be considered because they are closely tied or analogous to those specifically excluded activities of shopping for and preparing foods, and are too remote from the activity of feeding oneself:\ncommunication with people hosting events\ncommunication with family\/friends in preparation of gatherings\nself-education and educating others\ncommunication with restaurants\/staff when eating out\nattending celiac disease workshops\nmedical and nutrition appointments and communications\n[26] Many of these activities also are repetitive and do not occur regularly enough to warrant a weekly estimate of time.\n[27] While consuming vitamins and supplements could be considered related to the activity of feeding oneself, the estimated time is minimal and comparable to those who consume vitamins and supplements for other reasons.\n[28] The remaining listed activity that falls within the scope of feeding oneself is \u201cconsumption of gluten-free foods\u201d, estimated at 525 minutes per week. In her testimony, Ms. Adams clarified that the 525 minutes was in addition to the 480 minutes per week she estimated for consumption of food before she started a gluten-free diet.[17] She further stated that the time doubled because she needed to consume twice the amount of food to obtain nutrients.\n[29] However, this assertion is not supported by a dietary plan from her treating physician or dietician, or by the research she tendered as evidence.[18] The assertion also does not take into account the nutrients Ms. Adams would obtain from gluten-free food like fruit, vegetables, rice, potatoes, fish, and meat. Ultimately, it is unclear why time to consume food doubles when a gluten-free diet only requires substitution of some, not all foods.\n[30] As a result, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. Adams requires an inordinate amount of time to perform the activity of feeding herself.\n2. No other evidence of marked restriction\n[31] Prior to commencing a gluten-free diet to manage her celiac disease, Ms. Adams had vitamin deficiencies and experienced severe stomach pain and fatigue.\n[32] On their own, those symptoms do not demonstrate a marked impairment in feeding oneself or any of the other activities of daily living listed in the DTC provisions.\n[33] Notably, Ms. Adams\u2019 testimony suggests that her family doctor recognized the disconnect between her symptoms and the DTC criteria. She and her family doctor tried to \u201cunderstand and learn more about how celiac disease interacts with the disability tax credit\u201d. Her family doctor made the change in the Revised Certificate to indicate a marked restriction in feeding on the basis that the \u201ccategory made the most sense at the time\u201d and fit \u201cin terms of the categories that are available for the disability tax credit\u201d.\n[34] Essentially, Ms. Adams and her family doctor determined that feeding oneself includes the ability to absorb nutrients from food. In support of her appeal, Ms. Adams argued that \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d should go beyond the physical aspect of consuming food; it should include the ability to absorb nutrients because that is the purpose of eating.\n[35] While I understand the rationale behind this argument, it cannot succeed because it extends the DTC beyond its intended scope. Simply put, this interpretation would automatically qualify every taxpayer who suffers from celiac disease. While celiac disease results in an impairment, taxpayers must still establish that the effects of the disease fall within the DTC criteria in their particular case.[19]\n[36] In Hamilton, the Federal Court of Appeal held that not everyone with celiac disease is entitled to claim the DTC, and referred to the different outcomes of celiac disease cases heard by this Court in the years prior.[20] The different decisions highlight that evidence plays a critical role in each case. Symptoms of celiac disease vary depending on age, duration, and severity of the disease.[21]\n[37] Evidentiary differences also highlight the limited relevance of non-celiac disease cases for the purpose of deciding this appeal. Ms. Adams\u2019 reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in Hughes is misplaced because the facts are significantly different. In Hughes, the taxpayer\u2019s child had phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disease diagnosed through testing of newborns.[22] If left untreated, PKU affects cognitive ability and leads to permanent, severe brain damage in a matter of weeks.[23] PKU cannot be managed by eliminating a single compound like gluten; it requires constant balancing of levels of a specific protein, using measurements, formula, and medical food sold and labelled as such.[24] The Court therefore determined that there was a marked restriction in the daily activity of \u201cmental functions necessary for everyday life\u201d.[25]\n[38] Ms. Adams argued that a humane, compassionate and common sense interpretation should yield a similar result in her case. However, applying the Court\u2019s findings in Hughes would disregard the clear requirements of the DTC provisions at issue and the different facts of Ms. Adams\u2019 case.\nB. No therapy essential to maintain a vital function\n[39] Ms. Adams also argued that she would be markedly restricted in feeding herself but for the therapy of adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. This argument fails because it is predicated on the faulty assumption that an underlying marked restriction exists. As outlined above, the effects of celiac disease do not lead any marked restrictions in Ms. Adams\u2019 case.\n[40] In any event, her gluten-free diet does not qualify as therapy under paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) and subsection 118.3(1.1).\n[41] Similar to \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d, Parliament has restricted the term \u201ctherapy\u201d for the purpose of the DTC. The therapy for celiac disease is a dietary restriction or regime excluded from the calculation of time spent as therapy, under the provisions applicable in the 2021 taxation year. That version of paragraph 118.3(1.1)(d) stated that the time spent on therapy:\ndoes not include time spent on activities related to dietary or exercise restrictions or regimes (even if those restrictions or regimes are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication), travel time, medical appointments, shopping for medication or recuperation after therapy.\n[42] This provision excludes the activities Ms. Adams has listed in her calculation of time spent managing and treating her celiac disease.\n[43] Ms. Adams attempted to rely on a subsequent amendment that includes time spent on \u201cthe daily consumption of a medical food or medical formula to limit intake of a particular compound to levels required for the proper development or functioning of the body\u201d.[26] In doing so, Ms. Adams has disregarded the fact that dietary restrictions or regimes are still excluded.[27] Parliament has created a distinction between medical foods and dietary restrictions. A gluten-free diet does not involve the consumption of a medical food or formula.[28]\nIV. Conclusion\n[44] This decision does not speak to the importance of Ms. Adams following a gluten-free diet to address the associated risks of celiac disease and to ultimately live a better, healthier life. The focus of this analysis is the specific legal question of whether Ms. Adams met the criteria to qualify for the DTC. In answering this question, I am bound to apply the clear words and parameters established by Parliament. Ms. Adams does not have a marked restriction in feeding as that term is understood under the Act.\n[45] The appeal is therefore dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of

that\n(i) is essential to sustain a vital function of the individual,\n(ii) is required to be administered at least three times each week for a total duration averaging not less than 14 hours a week, and\n(iii) cannot reasonably be expected to be of significant benefit to persons who are not so impaired,\n(a.2) in the case of an impairment in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform a single basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted or would be so restricted but for therapy referred to in paragraph (a.1), a medical practitioner has certified in prescribed form that the impairment is a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted or would be markedly restricted, but for therapy referred to in paragraph (a.1), where the medical practitioner is a medical doctor or, in the case of\n(i) a sight impairment, an optometrist,\n(ii) a speech impairment, a speech-language pathologist,\n(iii) a hearing impairment, an audiologist,\n(iv) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in feeding or dressing themself, an occupational therapist,\n(v) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in walking, an occupational therapist, or after February 22, 2005, a physiotherapist, and\n(vi) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in mental functions necessary for everyday life, a psychologist,\n(a.3) in the case of one or more impairments in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living is significantly restricted, a medical practitioner has certified in prescribed form that the impairment or impairments are severe and prolonged impairments in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living is significantly restricted and that the cumulative effect of those restrictions is equivalent to having a marked restriction in the ability to perform a single basic activity of daily living, where the medical practitioner is, in the case of\n(i) an impairment with respect to the individual\u2019s ability in feeding or dressing themself, or in walking, a medical doctor or an occupational therapist, and\n(ii) in the case of any other impairment, a medical doctor,\n(b) the individual has filed for a taxation year with the Minister the certificate described in paragraph (a.2) or (a.3), and\n(c) no amount in respect of remuneration for an attendant or care in a nursing home, in respect of the individual, is included in calculating a deduction under section 118.2 (otherwise than because of paragraph 118.2(2)(b.1)) for the year by the individual or by any other person,\nthere may be deducted in computing the individual\u2019s tax payable under this Part for the year the amount determined by the formula\nA \u00d7 (B + C)\nwhere\nA\nis the appropriate percentage for the year,\nB\nis $6,000,

year\nexceeds\n(B) $2,050, and\n(b) in any other case, zero.\nTime spent on therapy\n118.3(1.1) For the purpose of paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1), in determining whether therapy is required to be administered at least three times each week for a total duration averaging not less than an average of 14 hours a week, the time spent on administering therapy\n(a) includes only time spent on activities that require the individual to take time away from normal everyday activities in order to receive the therapy;\n(b) in the case of therapy that requires a regular dosage of medication that is required to be adjusted on a daily basis, includes (subject to paragraph (d)) time spent on activities that are directly related to the determination of the dosage of the medication;\n(c) in the case of a child who is unable to perform the activities related to the administration of the therapy as a result of the child\u2019s age, includes the time, if any, spent by the child\u2019s primary caregivers performing or supervising those activities for the child; and\n(d) does not include time spent on activities related to dietary or exercise restrictions or regimes (even if those restrictions or regimes are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication), travel time, medical appointments, shopping for medication or recuperation after therapy.\nNature of impairment\n118.4 (1) For the purposes of subsection 6(16), sections 118.2 and 118.3 and this subsection,\n(a) an impairment is prolonged where it has lasted, or can reasonably be expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 months;\n(b) an individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted only where all or substantially all of the time, even with therapy and the use of appropriate devices and medication, the individual is blind or is unable (or requires an inordinate amount of time) to perform a basic activity of daily living;\n(b.1) an individual is considered to have the equivalent of a marked restriction in a basic activity of daily living only where all or substantially all of the time, even with therapy and the use of appropriate devices and medication, the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living (including for this purpose, the ability to see) is significantly restricted, and the cumulative effect of those restrictions is tantamount to the individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living being markedly restricted;\n(c) a basic activity of daily living in relation to an individual means\n(i) mental functions necessary for everyday life,\n(ii) feeding oneself or dressing oneself,\n(iii) speaking so as to be understood, in a quiet setting, by another person familiar with the individual,\n(iv) hearing so as to understand, in a quiet setting, another person familiar with the individual,\n(v) eliminating (bowel or bladder functions), or\n(vi) walking;\n(c.1) mental functions necessary for everyday life include\n(i) memory,\n(ii) problem solving, goal-setting and judgement (taken together), and\n(iii) adaptive functioning;\n(d) for greater certainty, no other activity, including working, housekeeping or a social or recreational activity, shall be considered as a basic activity of daily living; and\n(e) feeding oneself does not include\n(i) any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food, or\n(ii) the activity of preparing food to the extent that the time associated with the activity would not have been necessary in the absence of a dietary restriction or regime; and\n(f) dressing oneself does not include any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring clothing.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 28\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-1952(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMichelle Adams v.

Bocock\u201d\nBocock J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 29\nDate: 20240313\nDocket: 2023-1435(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nLORETTA STO DOMINGO,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nBocock J.\n[1] This application is brought for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under the Income Tax Act against an assessment for the 2012 taxation year and a reassessment for the 2013 taxation year.\n[2] The Applicant, Loretta Sto Domingo (pronounced Santo Domingo), speaks little English. An interpreter presided throughout the hearing. Further, as suggested by the Court at the conclusion of the hearing, Ms. Sto Domingo confirmed written reasons for the Order would be appreciated. Hence, these written reasons.\n[3] There are no disputed facts. In response to the 2012 assessment and 2013 reassessment, Ms. Sto Domingo filed notices of objection to the Minister\u2019s disallowance of charitable donations claimed in those two tax years. The deductions under section 118.1 concerned purported courseware gifts and cash donations under the Global Learning and Gifting Initiative (\u201cGLGI\u201d).\n[4] In response to the objections, the Minister confirmed the respective assessment and reassessment by joint notice of confirmation dated March 2, 2022. The next communication, filing or action occurred on July 10, 2023. On that date, Ms. Sto Domingo filed an application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.\n[5] Ms. Sto Domingo testified directly and on cross-examination that her life between March 2, 2022 and July 10, 2023 was difficult and confused.\n[6] Her physical and financial health, and that of her family distracted her. Physically, she contracted COVID-19 several times during that period as did her husband. Financially, her tax preparer died in or around May, 2022. As someone unfamiliar with the language and tax matters, assistance was needed, but difficult to access.\n[7] Confusion was the order of the day. After turning to other GLGI subscribers, Ms. Sto Domingo discovered that others too were uncertain and unknowing of where to turn. In short, she did not understand the significance of the notice of confirmation once she re-discovered having received it.\n[8] On cross-examination, Ms. Sto Domingo confirmed she received the notice of confirmation, did not contact the CRA in response, instead tried to seek advice elsewhere in vain and, ultimately, only refocused on the issue once garnishment proceedings were threatened. This caused her to begin paying the tax in December 2023, while seeking this extension.\n[9] In argument, Ms. Sto Domingo asserts the deadline was \u201coverlooked\u201d because of all of these unforeseen and unfortunate contributing factors.\n[10] The Income Tax Act clearly states the conditions under which an extension to file a notice of appeal may be granted once an assessment or reassessment for tax has been confirmed and sent by the CRA. Firstly, subsection 169(1) provides the taxpayer with ninety (90) days to file a notice of appeal with the Court.\n[11] If the taxpayer misses that deadline, there is further relief. Subsection 167(5) provides that a taxpayer may bring an extension application within (1) one year after the expiration of the ninety days initial deadline.\n[12] Those deadlines apply to the facts in this application as follows:\nOccurrence\/Deadline\nApplicable Date of Occurrence\nNotice of Confirmation for 2012 and 2013\nMarch 2, 2022\nNinety (90) Days after confirmation to file notice of appeal: ss. 169(1)\nMay 31, 2022\nOne Year after the 90 day period to file application to extend time to file notice of appeal: ss. 167(5)\nMay 31, 2023\nExtension Application filed by Ms. Sto Domingo with the Tax Court\nJuly 10, 2023\n[13] No excuse exists where a taxpayer fails to act and misses the extension application deadline under subsection 167(5). The final ironclad deadline above relevant in this application is May 31, 2023. Ms. Sto Domingo did not file her application until July 10, 2023. This inflexibility appears, and perhaps rightly has been described as, harsh.\n[14] Lest anyone should think that such a clear redline has come from the bench of relevant courts, critics are directed to the preamble of the section. No less a body than Parliament, itself, marshalled the clearest, evocative language it could:\nS. 167 \u2026\nWhen order to be made\n(5) No order shall be made under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time limited by section 169 for appealing; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by section 169 for appealing the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to appeal,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application,\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted, and\n(iv) there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.\n[emphasis added]\n[15] As such, both the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have emphasized repeatedly that they have no discretion, flexibility or leniency to pry that forged deadline open. That is true no matter how sympathetic, unforeseen or unavoidable the impediments are to filing the extension application. Unfortunately for Ms. Sto Domingo, that holds in this application.\n[16] If the notice of confirmation is sent, as it was in this application, time commences to run. If a taxpayer takes no measureable or meaningful responsive action to file (or even attempt to file), as none occurred in this application, within the combined one year and ninety days, then this Court is powerless to countermand the mandated direction of Parliament. Justice McPhee succinctly reviewed the leading Federal Court of Appeal and Tax Court authorities concerning the clear, unequivocal and fatal nature of the deadlines, no matter how sympathetic the reasons for the omission: Dutka v. HMQ 2020 TCC 21 at paragraphs 18 through 26.\n[17] Given the above, there is no need for the Court to consider any alternative submissions of the Respondent concerning whether there are \u201creasonable grounds for the appeal\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 167(5)(iv).\nConclusion [18] Regrettably, for all these reasons, the application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal is dismissed. There shall be no costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of March 2024.\n\u201cR.S.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 31\nDate: 20240312\nDocket: 2019-2603(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nSUNCOR ENERGY INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\n[1] This appeal relates to the application of the available-for-use rules contained in subsections 13(26) to 13(32) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, C.1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d). These rules provide that a taxpayer may not add the cost of a depreciable capital property to the relevant undepreciated capital cost (\u201cUCC\u201d) pool until the property is considered, under the Act, to have become available for use. A taxpayer cannot claim capital cost allowance (\u201cCCA\u201d) in respect of the property until the cost of the property is added to the UCC pool.\n[2] The specific issue in this appeal is whether the deeming rule in subsection 13(31) creates a notional taxation year in the situation where a taxpayer is deemed to have acquired depreciable capital property at a time when the taxpayer was not yet in existence. The answer to this question determines the point in time at which the property is considered, for the purposes of subsection 13(26), to be available for use under the so-called two-year rolling start rule in paragraph 13(27)(b).\nSummary of Facts\n[3] The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts. There were no witnesses. The Agreed Statement of Facts is attached as Appendix A to these reasons for judgment.\n[4] The facts may be summarized as follows:\n-The Appellant is an integrated energy company that operates oil sands, natural gas, refining and marketing businesses.\n-The Appellant\u2019s oil sands business includes the upgrading and processing of crude bitumen and other related products.\n-During the relevant period, the Appellant had a December 31 year-end.\n-The Millennium Coker Unit was part of the Millennium mine that was built to increase oil sands production.\n-In 2003, the Appellant began the Millennium Coker Unit project (the \u201cMCU Project\u201d), whose purpose was to add a third set of cokers to the upgrader associated with the Millennium Coker Unit as well as make modifications to other upgrader components.\n-In January 2005, the Appellant incurred expenses in the amount of $34,368,000 to acquire, for the MCU Project, depreciable property described in Class 41 of Schedule II of the Income Tax Regulations, C.R.C., r. 945 (the \u201cMCU Depreciable Properties\u201d).\n-Suncor Energy Oil Sands Inc. (the \u201cSubsidiary\u201d) was incorporated on January 19, 2005 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Appellant.\n-On February 1, 2005, the Suncor Energy Oil Sands Limited Partnership (the \u201cLimited Partnership\u201d) was formed and registered as a limited partnership, with the Appellant as the general partner and the Subsidiary as the limited partner. The Appellant held a 99.9% interest in the Limited Partnership and the Subsidiary held a 0.1% interest.\n-The Appellant and the Limited Partnership were not dealing at arm\u2019s length for purposes of the Act.\n-The fiscal period of the Limited Partnership ended on January 31.\n-The net income of the Limited Partnership was allocated at the end of its fiscal year in proportion to each partner\u2019s partnership interest.\n-On January 1, 2006, the Appellant contributed the MCU Depreciable Properties (together with other assets comprising its oil sands business) to the Limited Partnership.\n-The Appellant and the Limited Partnership filed a joint election pursuant to subsection 97(2) with an elected amount of $823,241,000 in respect of depreciable property included in Class 41 (which included $34,368,000 relating to the MCU Depreciable Properties). The elected amount was equal to the fair market value of such properties.\n[5] For CCA purposes, the Limited Partnership added $34,368,000 to its Class 41 UCC balance on the basis that the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use immediately after the beginning of the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.[1] The Limited Partnership then deducted the related CCA when computing its net income for its fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.\n[6] The Limited Partnership allocated 99.9% of its income for its fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007 to the Appellant.\n[7] The Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2007 taxation year on the basis that the MCU Depreciable Properties were not available for use at any time during the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007. The reassessment disallowed the addition of $34,368,000 to the Limited Partnership\u2019s UCC balance and the related CCA deduction. This resulted in an increase in the income of the Limited Partnership and, therefore, in the amount of income allocated to the Appellant in respect of the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.\nThe Law and the Issue\n[8] Paragraph 18(1)(b) prohibits the deduction of an outlay of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation when calculating the income of a taxpayer from a business, except as expressly permitted under the Act.\n[9] Paragraph 20(1)(a) and the related regulations allow a taxpayer to deduct CCA in respect of the UCC of its depreciable capital assets. It appears from paragraphs 6 and 16 of the Agreed Statement of Facts that the MCU Depreciable Properties are Class 41 properties with a CCA rate of 25%.\n[10] Section 13 contains a number of rules for determining the UCC of a taxpayer\u2019s depreciable capital assets. The relevant rule for purposes of this appeal is the so-called available-for-use rule contained in subsections 13(26) to (32)\u2014in particular, the rules contained in subsections 13(26), 13(27) and 13(31).\n[11] Subsection 13(26) sets out the available-for-use rule. It provides that a taxpayer cannot add an amount to the UCC of depreciable property of a prescribed class, in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class, until the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer. The subsection reads as follows:\n13(26) In applying the definition \u201cundepreciated capital cost\u201d in subsection (21) for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a) and any regulations made for the purpose of that paragraph, in computing a taxpayer's income for a taxation year from a business or property, no amount shall be included in calculating the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of a prescribed class in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class (other than property that is a certified production, as defined by regulations made for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a)) before the time the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer.\n[12] As a result of subsection 13(26), the Limited Partnership was not entitled to add the $34,368,000 cost of the MCU Depreciable Properties to its Class 41 UCC balance until such time as the properties became available for use by the Limited Partnership.\n[13] Subsection 13(27) contains a number of rules for determining when a depreciable property, other than a building, is considered to have become available for use. The provision provides that the property is available for use at the earliest of a number of times.\n[14] The general rule, contained in paragraph 13(27)(a), states that a property is available for use at the time the property is first used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income. Paragraphs (b) through (k) of subsection 13(27) provide rules that may result in the property becoming available for use before it is first used to earn income. The complete provision is attached as Appendix B.\n[15] The relevant portions of the subsection, for purposes of this appeal, are paragraphs 13(27)(a) and (b), which read as follows:\n13(27) For the purposes of subsection (26) and subject to subsection (29), property (other than a building or part thereof) acquired by a taxpayer shall be considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer at the earliest of\n(a) the time the property is first used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income,\n(b) the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the taxpayer that begins more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the taxpayer in which the property was acquired by the taxpayer,\n[16] Under paragraph 13(27)(b), the property will be considered to have become available for use immediately after the beginning of the second taxation year after the taxation year in which the taxpayer acquired the property. Further, the intervening taxation year must be a full taxation year, at least 357 days long. This is referred to as the two-year rolling start rule.\n[17] I have assumed, on the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts, that the Limited Partnership did not use the MCU Depreciable Properties for the purpose of earning income during the relevant periods. It appears that the Appellant did not complete the MCU Project until some future date.\n[18] On the basis of this assumption, paragraph 13(27)(b) determined when the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use by the Limited Partnership for the purposes of subsection 13(26). Therefore, under the two-year rolling start rule, the Limited Partnership was not entitled to claim CCA in respect of the MCU Depreciable Properties until the time that was immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year in which the MCU Depreciable Properties were acquired by the Limited Partnership.\n[19] As a question of fact, the Limited Partnership acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties on January 1, 2006. The taxation year of actual acquisition ended on January 31, 2006.\n[20] The first taxation year that began more than 357 days after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s January 31, 2006 taxation year is its taxation year that began on February 1, 2007 and ended on January 31, 2008.\n[21] Therefore, if one only considers paragraph 13(27)(b), the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use on February 1, 2007, the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year ending on January 31, 2008.\n[22] However, subsection 13(27) is subject to subsection 13(31), which provides a deeming rule that applies, in part, when a person acquires property from a person with whom it is not dealing at arm\u2019s length. The subsection reads as follows:\n13(31) For the purposes of paragraphs (27)(b) and (28)(c) and subsection (29), where a property of a taxpayer was acquired from a person (in this subsection referred to as \u201cthe transferor\u201d)\n(a) with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length (otherwise than because of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)), or\n(b) in the course of a reorganization in respect of which, if a dividend were received by a corporation in the course of the reorganization, subsection 55(2) would not apply to the dividend because of the application of paragraph 55(3)(b),\nthe taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[23] Under paragraph 13(31)(a), where a taxpayer acquires property from a person with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length, the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[24] Paragraph 13(31)(b) applies where a taxpayer acquires property from a person in the course of a butterfly transaction described in paragraph 55(3)(b). It is not relevant for purposes of determining the point in time when the MCU Depreciable Properties were available for use.\n[25] The parties have agreed that the Appellant and the Limited Partnership were not dealing at arm\u2019s length at the time the Limited Partnership acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties. Therefore, under paragraph 13(31)(a), the Limited Partnership was deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. However, the Limited Partnership did not come into existence until February 1, 2005. In other words, the Limited Partnership did not exist at the time it was deemed under paragraph 13(31)(a) to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties.\n[26] This leads to an interpretation issue with respect to the effect of the subsection 13(31) deeming rule.\nPositions of the Parties\n[27] The Appellant argues that subsection 13(31) is designed to operate where the transferee did not yet exist at the time it was deemed to have acquired the property, namely the point in time when the property was acquired by the transferor. Specifically, in this situation, subsection 13(31), by its text, context and purpose, necessarily requires that the transferee have a notional taxation year at the time it is deemed to have acquired the property.\n[28] The Appellant notes that this interpretation gives effect to the relieving nature of paragraph 13(27)(b) and the continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s\u2011length parties in paragraph 13(31)(a).\n[29] The Appellant argues that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation is not harmonious with the Act because the Respondent\u2019s position requires a notional fiscal period of at least 13 months. Subsection 249(1.1) limits taxation years (and fiscal periods) of a partnership to 12 months.\n[30] It is the Appellant\u2019s position that the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in a notional taxation year beginning on February 1, 2004 and ending on January 31, 2005. The Appellant argues that this corresponds to the normal fiscal period that the Limited Partnership would have had, had it been in existence in January 2005.\n[31] The Appellant then argues that since the Limited Partnership is deemed under subsection 13(31) to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005, the properties became available for use on February 1, 2006, which was the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year that began on February 1, 2006 and ended on January 31, 2007. This is the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s notional taxation year that theoretically ended on January 31, 2005.\n[32] The Respondent agrees that under subsection 13(31), the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. However, he argues that subsection 13(31) only deems the date of acquisition for the acquiring taxpayer for purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b); it does nothing else. In particular, the deeming provision in subsection 13(31) does not deem or create a notional taxation year for the Limited Partnership that ends on January 31, 2005.\n[33] The Respondent emphasizes that a textual analysis of paragraph 13(27)(b) makes it clear that for a property to be available for use under this paragraph, at least two actual taxation years of the taxpayer must have passed after a property\u2019s acquisition. This is unambiguous and is not changed by the deeming rule in subsection 13(31).\n[34] The Respondent argues that the counting of the 357 days begins from the end of the first actual taxation year of the Limited Partnership\u2014the taxation year of the Limited Partnership ending on January 31, 2006. Under the Respondent\u2019s argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use on February 1, 2007, which was the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year that began on February 1, 2007 and ended on January 31, 2008.\n[35] The Limited Partnership taxation year that ended on January 31, 2008 was its first taxation year that began more than 357 days after the end of its first taxation year.\n[36] In summary, the Appellant argues that the MCU Depreciable Properties that the Limited Partnership was deemed to have acquired in January 2005 became available for use on February 1, 2006, while the Respondent argues that they became available for use on February 1, 2007.\nAnalysis and Disposition of the Appeal\n[37] In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, [2] the Supreme Court of Canada identified the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive\u201d principle as the principle that is to be used when interpreting the Act. At paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Court explained the principle as follows:\n[10] \u2026 The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play[s] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\n[38] The issue before the Court involves the application of the available-for-use rules in subsections 13(26) to (32). The authors of the book Timing and Income Taxation: The Principles of Income Measurement for Tax Purposes describe the purpose and effect of the available-for-use rules as follows:\nThe available-for-use rules, contained in subsections 13(26) through (32), are intended to prevent the claiming of capital cost allowance in respect of a property until that property is actually used in the income-earning process. These rules have the effect of matching the cost of the property incurred with revenue earned from the use of the property and are consistent with the claiming of depreciation for financial accounting purposes.[3]\n[39] The wording of each of the relevant provisions for purposes of this appeal (subsection 13(26), and paragraphs 13(27)(b) and 13(31)(a)) is clear\u2014there are no ambiguities.\n[40] Subsection 13(26) clearly states that it applies when one is applying the definition \u201cundepreciated capital cost\u201d in subsection 13(21) for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a) and any regulations made for the purposes of that paragraph, in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business or property. In such a situation, subsection 13(26) provides that no amount shall be included in calculating the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of a prescribed class in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class[4] before the time the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer.\n[41] The wording is clear: when calculating a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business or property, the cost of a depreciable capital property cannot be added to the undepreciated capital cost of the relevant prescribed class until the property is available for use.\n[42] The wording accomplishes the Minister of Finance\u2019s purpose when putting the provision before Parliament as set out in the Department of Finance\u2019s May 1991 technical notes, which state the following:\nNew subsection 13(26) provides that, for the purpose only of calculating the capital cost allowance claim to which a taxpayer may be entitled, no amount in respect of a property is to be included in computing the undepreciated capital cost of depreciable property of a prescribed class until the property has become \u201cavailable for use\u201d by the taxpayer. The rules for determining the time at which property becomes \u201cavailable for use\u201d are provided in new subsections 13(27) to (32), described below.\n[43] As noted previously, paragraph 13(27)(b) is one of the rules that is used to determine when a property becomes available for use.\n[44] Paragraph 13(27)(b) only applies for the purposes of subsection 13(26) and is subject to subsection 13(29).[5] Subsection 13(29) applies where property (other than a building that is used or is to be used principally to earn rental income) is acquired in the course of a multi-year project. The subsection allows the taxpayer to make an election that modifies the normal available-for-use rules.\n[45] Paragraph 13(27)(b) clearly states that one of the times that property[6] acquired by a taxpayer shall be considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer is the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the taxpayer that begins more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the taxpayer in which the property was acquired by the taxpayer.\n[46] Similar to the wording of subsection 13(26), the wording of the paragraph is straightforward and contains no ambiguities.\n[47] As noted in the Department of Finance\u2019s May 1991 technical notes, the purpose of the paragraph is to provide that one of the times that property will be considered to be available for use is \u201cthe beginning of the first taxation year commencing at least 358 days after the taxation year in which the property was acquired (the two-year \u2018rolling start\u2019 rule)\u201d. The effect of the provision is to place a time limit on when a property may become available for use. The time limit is fixed by the dual requirements that the person or partnership acquiring the property have a taxation year-end following the acquisition of the property, which is followed by a second taxation year-end that is at least 357 days after the first taxation year-end.\n[48] Paragraph 13(31)(a) contains the deeming rule that is at issue in this appeal. It is not a complicated provision. The wording of the provision provides that:\n-The paragraph applies for the purposes of paragraphs 13(27)(b) and 13(28)(c) and subsection 13(29). As noted previously, subsection 13(29) applies to certain multi-year projects. Paragraph 13(28)(c) contains the same two-year rolling start rule as the rule provided in paragraph 13(27)(b); however, paragraph 13(28)(c) only applies to buildings.\n-Paragraph 13(31)(a) applies where a taxpayer acquires property from a person with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length.\n-Once the paragraph applies, the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[49] There are no ambiguities in this provision. Its application is limited to specific sections of the Act and it deems the non-arm\u2019s-length transferee to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[50] Paragraph 13(31)(a) clearly states that if the parties were dealing at non\u2011arm\u2019s-length at the time the property was transferred, then the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[51] I agree with the Appellant that the wording of the paragraph leads to the conclusion that the purpose of the provision is to provide for continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s-length parties when applying the two-year rolling start rule.\n[52] The clear and unambiguous effect of the deeming rule in paragraph 13(31)(a) is that, for the purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b), the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005.\n[53] Therefore, the properties became available for use at the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the Limited Partnership in which the MCU Depreciable Properties were acquired by the Limited Partnership.\n[54] The question before the Court is, does paragraph 13(31)(a) deem the Limited Partnership to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in a notional taxation year created by subsection 13(31) that ended on January 31, 2005?\n[55] The answer depends on the effect of the deeming rule in subsection 13(31)\u2014a deeming rule that creates a legal fiction.\n[56] The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Verrette,[7] the seminal case on deeming rules, stated the following at page 845:\n\u2026 A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. \u2026\n[57] The Appellant asks the Court to find that the effect of the deeming rule in subsection 13(31), in the fact situation before the Court, is to create a notional taxation year for the purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b). I do not accept this argument.\n[58] I agree with the Respondent that subsection 13(31) only deems one thing to occur. It deems the Limited Partnership to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. It does not deem the Limited Partnership to have a notional taxation year.\n[59] The Appellant is asking me to read words into the provision that are not there. That is not the role of the Court; rather, it is the role of Parliament to determine the wording of a provision. If Parliament had intended that a notional taxation year be created in the fact situation before the Court, then it would have specifically stated that a notional taxation year is created. This would require very specific and detailed language.\n[60] As I noted in Vefghi Holding Corp. v. The King[8] at paragraph 55, once it is determined that a deeming provision applies, one must then look at the actual wording of the deeming provision to determine what legal fiction is created. Specifically, one must determine to what extent the created legal fiction changes what, as a question of fact, actually occurred. In making this determination, one must remember that the scope of a deeming provision is limited to what is clearly expressed in the provision.[9]\n[61] Subsection 13(31) deems an acquisition of property to occur on a different day than the day that the property was actually acquired. However, that is all it does; it does not contain any wording that deems the Limited Partnership, for purposes of subsection 13(27) or any other section of the Act, to have been in existence prior to its formation on February 1, 2005 or to have had a notional taxation year prior to the time that it came into existence.\n[62] Both parties focused on the paragraph 249(1)(a) definition of taxation year.\n[63] Paragraph 96(1)(b) of the Act provides that when calculating the income of a taxpayer who is a member of a partnership, the income is to be computed as if the partnership were a separate person resident in Canada whose taxation year was its fiscal period.\n[64] Paragraph 249(1)(a), as it currently reads, states the following: \u201cIn this Act, except as expressly otherwise provided, a \u2018taxation year\u2019 is in the case of a corporation or Canadian resident partnership, a fiscal period\u201d. This paragraph was amended effective October 31, 2006 to add the words \u201cCanadian resident partnership\u201d. Prior to that time, paragraph 249(1)(a) only referred to a corporation.\n[65] As both parties stated, the effect of paragraphs 96(1)(b) and 249(1)(a) is that during the relevant periods, the taxation year of the Limited Partnership was its fiscal period.\n[66] Fiscal period is defined in subsection 249.1(1). During the relevant periods, paragraph 249.1(1)(c) was the relevant paragraph for purposes of this appeal. It reads as follows:\n249.1(1) For the purposes of this Act, a \u201cfiscal period\u201d of a business or a property of a person or partnership means the period for which the person's or partnership's accounts in respect of the business or property are made up for purposes of assessment under this Act, but no fiscal period may end \u2026\n(c) ... more than 12 months after the period began.[10]\n[67] Since the Limited Partnership did not exist prior to February 1, 2005, it did not prepare accounts prior to February 1, 2005. Therefore, it did not have a fiscal period prior to February 1, 2005. As a result, it did not have a taxation year under the Act prior to February 1, 2005.\n[68] There is nothing in the wording of subsection 13(31) that creates the fiction of the Limited Partnership having a year-end prior to February 1, 2005\u2014specifically, as the Appellant argues, a 12-month fictional taxation year that ended on January 31, 2005. The creation of such a fictional taxation year would require very specific wording that, at a minimum, addresses the fictional existence of the Limited Partnership during this period and the beginning and end of the fictional taxation year.\n[69] The Appellant argues that the creation of a notional taxation year is consistent with the rationale for the available-for-use rules in subsections 13(26) to (32). I do not agree. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s position defeats the purpose of the two-year rolling start rule by shortening the length of time that the Limited Partnership is required to have held the property to one completed taxation year.\n[70] As noted by the Respondent, the two-year rolling start rule does not look at when the property is first used to produce income, but rather allows for the claiming of CCA in the third taxation year after the property is acquired. As previously stated, subsection 13(27) imposes a waiting period that is determined by reference to two taxation year-ends. In order for subsection 13(27)(b) to apply, the taxpayer must acquire the property, the taxpayer must have a year-end, and then 357 days must pass before the next year-end of the taxpayer. Under subsection 13(27)(b), two actual year-ends must pass before a property is considered to have become available for use.\n[71] Under the Appellant\u2019s position, the time is shortened by one actual year-end of the Limited Partnership. Since the notional taxation year would be before the start of the Limited Partnership\u2019s first taxation year, under the Appellant\u2019s position, the Limited Partnership could claim CCA in respect of the MCU Depreciable Properties immediately after the end of its first taxation year, as long as its first taxation year is at least 357 days. In my view, this defeats the purpose of the two-year rolling start rule.\n[72] Subsection 13(31) attempts to preserve the two-year rolling start rule when depreciable property is transferred between non-arm\u2019s-length parties. In the situation where the transferor and transferee have different year-ends, the actual date when the property is available for use will change; however, the time period must still include two taxation year-ends, spread more than 357 days apart.\n[73] It is not the intention of subsection 13(31) to shorten the time period to one actual year-end.\n[74] The Appellant\u2019s fact situation shows that this is what would occur if the Court accepts the Appellant\u2019s argument. Under the Appellant\u2019s argument, only one actual taxation year of the Limited Partnership would pass before the MCU Depreciable Properties become available for use.\n[75] If I accept the Appellant\u2019s argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties that the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired in January 2005 would become available for use on February 1, 2006, after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s first taxation year.\n[76] The Respondent\u2019s argument, however, preserves the two-year rolling start rule. Under his argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties become available for use on February 1, 2007, after the end of the second taxation year of the Limited Partnership.\n[77] The Respondent\u2019s position is consistent with the purpose of paragraph 13(31)(a) to provide continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s-length parties, while preserving the two-year rolling start rule.\n[78] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed, with costs.\nSigned at Winnipeg, Manitoba, this 12th day of March 2024.\n\u201cS.

The Appellant did not do either of these things within that deadline nor has she done so since.\n[5] On February 5, 2024, the Registry wrote to the Appellant and asked the Appellant to provide any written representations that the Appellant might have about the Motion prior to February 13, 2024. The Appellant did not respond to that letter by that date nor has she done so since.\n[6] I have reviewed the Respondent\u2019s motion materials. I am satisfied that:\n(a)the Appellant was made aware of this issue as soon as the Respondent filed the Reply;\n(b)she has had multiple chances to address the issue since then;\n(c)she has failed to do so in any meaningful way;\n(d)she knew that the Respondent intended to bring the Motion; and\n(e)she failed to respond to the Motion.\n[7] In the circumstances, I have concluded that it is appropriate to decide the Motion based on written representations. As the Appellant has not filed any written representations, I will determine the issue based on the materials provided by the Respondent.\nQuashing [8] Based on the Respondent\u2019s materials, I find that the Appellant did not file a Notice of Objection to the reassessment of her 2008 tax year.\n[9] I am satisfied that the CRA did not receive a Notice of Objection for that year. The Appellant has not produced a copy of the Notice of Objection that she says she filed. She has not provided any details of when or how she filed it. She has not even been able to explain what she was objecting to beyond asserting that it involved $250 or less. There appears to be no connection between the GLGI issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal in respect of her 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and the small amount she says she is disputing for her 2008 tax year. In the circumstances, I find it difficult to conclude that she actually filed a Notice of Objection.\n[10] A taxpayer cannot appeal the reassessment of a tax year to this Court if the taxpayer has not first filed a Notice of Objection. Therefore, the appeal of the reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2008 tax year must be quashed.\nCosts [11] The Respondent has requested costs in respect of the motion. I will award those costs.\n[12] To the extent that the Respondent wants to seek costs in respect of the appeal of the 2008 taxation year as a whole, the Respondent may raise those costs at the conclusion of the trial of the appeals of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years as the trial judge will be in a better position to assess the costs of the appeals of the four years as a whole.\nSigned at Calgary, Alberta, this 12th day of March 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] In my May 10, 2023 judgment allowing the appeal with costs to the appellant, I gave the parties time to reach an agreement on costs failing which they were directed to file written submissions for my consideration. I also directed that if I did not hear from the parties with respect to costs, then costs would be awarded to the appellant according to Tariff B.[1]\n[2] The parties did not reach an agreement as to costs so they have provided written submissions. The appellant proposes that it is entitled to costs of $197,527.69 (being 75% of its solicitor and client costs) plus disbursements of $4,122.71. On the other hand, the respondent disagrees, saying that tariff costs are appropriate. At the Court\u2019s request, appellant\u2019s counsel provided copies of the legal invoices and summaries of disbursements.\nII. Procedural history\n[3] The one-and-a-half day hearing took place in April 2022 and was a Class C proceeding. The issue was whether certain services provided by the appellant were preparatory in nature and therefore fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d.[2] If so, then the services would fall outside the definition and would not be GST-exempt, thus obliging the appellant to collect and remit tax totaling $910,265 for the reporting periods from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016.[3]\n[4] The appeal was commenced in August 2020 and pleadings closed by December 2020. In January 2021, the Court issued a litigation timetable order based on dates proposed by the parties; no amendments were required. In July 2021, the appellant filed an amended notice of appeal with the respondent\u2019s consent. Later the same month, the respondent filed a reply to the amended notice of appeal and the timeline to do so was extended with the appellant\u2019s consent.\n[5] In September 2021, the parties submitted a joint application for a three-day hearing and requested an earlier sitting to accommodate appellant counsel\u2019s availability. The hearing was set down for April 19 to 21, 2022 and completed in one-and-a-half days. At the hearing, the parties relied on a statement of partial agreed facts and an agreed book of documents; two witnesses testified on behalf of the appellant. Judgment was reserved and while under reserve, the parties made three sets of follow-up written submissions in April 2022, July 2022, and January 2023. I did not request any of these submissions but agreed to consider them in the interest of procedural fairness.\nIII. Legislative framework\n[6] Section 147 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) gives this Court broad discretion to determine costs. The determination must be done on a principled basis which includes a proper weighing of the factors set in subsection 147(3).[4] No expert witnesses testified so the relevant factors are as follows:\nthe result of the proceeding;\nthe amounts in issue;\nthe importance of the issues;\nany offer of settlement made in writing;\nthe volume of work;\nthe complexity of the issues;\nthe conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding;\nthe denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted;\nwhether any stage in the proceedings was\n(i)improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii)taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution; and\nany other matter relevant to the question of costs.[5]\nIV. Analysis and discussion\n(a) The result of the proceeding [7] The relevant facts were the same across the reporting periods, which effectively made the appeal an all-or-nothing matter in which the appellant was wholly successful. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(b) The amounts in issue [8] The significance of the amounts in issue must be considered contextually and in relative terms.[6] In this instance, the amount of GST in issue was in the range of $200,000 per year based on fees paid by the appellant in the $4M range each year[7] and set against gross revenues exceeding $100M annually.[8]\n[9] The appellant says that the amounts in issue are greater than meets the eye because subsequent years are under audit and turned on the outcome of this appeal. I am not of the view that those amounts should be taken into consideration for the purposes of a costs award. To consider impacts outside the scope of an appeal in this way invites a degree of uncertainty that can make a costs determination nearly impossible.\n[10] While the amounts in issue would be significant in many instances, they are less so in the specific context of this case. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(c) The importance of the issues [11] At the time the decision was rendered, there was (and perhaps continues to be) no other decision dealing with the type of financial services in question in the context of credit unions. While one cannot know how many other credit unions might operate similarly to the appellant and therefore, be affected by this decision, it is reasonable to assume that there are some. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(d) Any offer of settlement made in writing [12] No written settlement offers were made so substantial indemnity costs[9] cannot be considered. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(e) The volume of work [13] Based on the invoice summary and the invoices submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel, legal fees were billed for approximately 296.6 hours of work. At the documentary disclosure stage, the appellant listed 60 documents while the respondent listed 42. Examinations for discovery by each party took less than one day[10] and there were no interlocutory applications. By the commencement of hearing, the parties were able to file a statement of partial agreed facts[11] and a joint book of 25 documents[12].\n[14] Explaining financial services delivered on an ongoing basis on a large scale by a financial institution would require an above-average amount of work to set out the factual context for the purposes of prosecuting the appeal. Five days before the hearing, the respondent conceded that the services in question fell within paragraph (l) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d, thus reducing the issue to a question of whether they then fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4).[13]\n[15] While the concession ultimately reduced the length of the hearing and the amount of preparation required, I would expect that the relatively short notice of the concession resulted in a meaningful amount of preparation already having been done on a material issue. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(f) The complexity of the issues [16] I am of the view that the substantive issues were average in complexity, particularly since they were narrowed down to the application of paragraph (r.4) by the time of the hearing. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(g) The conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding [17] In October 2021, the respondent conceded the issue of whether the appellant was required to collect and remit GST on services provided to Desjardins Financial Group with respect to the issuance of credit cards. The respondent later also conceded that the remaining services in question fell within paragraph (l) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d, thus reducing the issue to a question of whether they then fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4). Finally, the parties proceeded by way of a statement of partial agreed facts and a joint book of documents, both of which required the respondent\u2019s cooperation and consent.\n[18] The appellant argues that in light of the concession made five days before the hearing, that the respondent should have conceded the entire appeal. The remaining issue as to whether the exception in paragraph (r.4) applied was a valid one and the respondent was entitled to continue to dispute it. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(h) The denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted [19] This factor is neutral for the reasons discussed under subheading (g).\n(i) Whether any stage in the proceedings was (i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or (ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution [20] There is no evidence of this type of conduct so this factor is neutral.\n(j) Any other matter relevant to the question of costs [21] I am not of the view that there are any other relevant matters to consider in terms of costs.\nV. Conclusion\n[22] Based on the above, I am of the view that a costs award of $19,600 plus disbursements of $4,122.71 is appropriate, i.e. for a total of $23,722.71. The costs award approximately doubles the tariff, and takes into account the fact that there were amended pleadings, supplementary lists of documents filed by the appellant, an agreed statement of facts, and an agreement regarding documents. In making this award, I am particularly mindful of the appellant\u2019s success, the possible importance of this decision to other credit unions, and the late concession by the respondent with respect to paragraph (l) which shortened the hearing but likely led to some unnecessary trial preparation by the appellant.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of March 2024.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 34\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-1578(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nPROSPERA CREDIT UNION AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nDATE OF HEARING:\nDetermined by written submissions\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF ORDER:\nMarch 13, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nJoel A.

The reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 were statute-barred at the time of reassessment.\n[2] Because of the reassessments, the appellant\u2019s net tax liability was increased by $646,000. Encore was also assessed for gross negligence penalties, which amount to approximately $162,000.\nI. ISSUES\n[3] There are four main issues on appeal. They are:\n(i) Whether the Minister correctly assessed additional GST\/HST payable by the appellant; (ii) Whether the Minister correctly disallowed specific Input Tax Credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) claimed; (iii) Whether the appellant is liable for a penalty pursuant to s. 285 of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1], and (iv) Whether the Minister was correct in relying upon ss. 298(4) of the Act, to reassess the statute-barred reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 (the \u201cStatute-Barred Periods\u201d).[2] II. FACTS\n[4] The appellant is a GST registrant, having been registered for GST since May 26, 2005. The appellant had annual reporting periods from May 1, 2009 until April 30, 2012 and quarterly reporting periods until April 30, 2014.\n[5] The Minister reassessed the appellant for the Relevant Periods on or about October 28, 2015 (the \u201cReassessment\u201d). The appellant served the Minister with Notices of Objection on December 17, 2015 and on March 22, 2018.\n[6] The Minister determined that the appellant underreported GST\/HST payable amounting to $114,032.56 in the relevant period. The Minister reached this conclusion based upon an analysis of the appellant\u2019s general ledger, subsequent adjusting entries made to the general ledger by the appellant\u2019s accountant, and an analysis of the appellant\u2019s bank records.\n[7] A portion of the ITCs claimed by the appellant, amounting to $474,816, were denied by the Minister. At trial, the appellant agreed that ITCs were over claimed, but argued that they should be allowed a portion of the ITCs denied, totalling $182,622.\n[8] Further to the above paragraph, the appellant incorrectly claimed ITCs based upon a calculation of 13\/113 of the value of the consideration identified as having been paid for goods (based on Encore\u2019s accountant, Mr. Nasrullah\u2019s review of the bank records).\n[9] The ITCs being litigated came from two main sources. The first source of claimed ITCs relates to certain import goods purchased from non-registrant, non resident suppliers. These ITCs were claimed in relation to amounts identified as paid from the appellant\u2019s US fund bank account. The amount claimed by the appellant was $203,184. The Minister allowed $3,584.92 of this amount and denied the remaining claim for ITCs.\n[10] An additional $275,216.46 was claimed by the appellant and denied by the Minister. These claimed ITCs relate to invoices that were identified as RPW[3] and were paid to a foreign supplier[4].\n[11] Penalties were assessed. Overall, the Minister increased the appellant\u2019s net tax for the Relevant Periods by $646,784 and imposed total penalties of $161,953.47.\n[12] Three witnesses testified at trial. They were, Mr. Tahir Bajwa, the sole shareholder and director of the appellant. Mr. Mark Hatfield, a retired CRA officer who worked on the audit of the appellant that lead to the reassessment before the Court, and Mr. Ganesh Timsina, a team leader with CRA who attempted to explain the reassessment. I will more fully describe their testimony in the body of the facts.\nA. Business of the Appellant\n[13] During the Relevant Periods, the appellant was in the business of selling cellphones, accessories, and providing unlocking services for cellphones. The appellant had three retail locations.\n[14] Tahir Bajwa is the sole shareholder, director and decision maker of the appellant. Mr. Bajwa is responsible for completing and filing the appellant\u2019s GST\/HST returns.\n[15] Mr. Bajwa has been involved in the purchasing and selling of mobile telephones for approximately 20 years.\nB. Discrepancies in the General Ledger\n[16] An audit of the appellant began on February 8, 2014. Shortly after the commencement of the audit, the accountant for the appellant, Mr. Nasrullah, made various adjusting entries in the general ledger of the appellant.\n[17] In particular, the appellant\u2019s general ledger had the following correcting entries (this is the description provided in the g\/l for the entries).\nTo adjust HST account, 2011, HST account, $6431.66. 2012, HST account, $10,977.96. 2013, HST account, $25,719.78. I am making this adjustment as I feel these are actual HST payable and it -- and it should -- is not adjustment to today, is at 7:26 P.M.\n[18] These entries increased the GST\/HST payable by $43,129.40.\n[19] An additional adjusting entry, increasing GST\/HST payable by $38,744.92 was made on April 30th, 2014.\n[20] The Minister argued that these entries were correcting entries by the appellant\u2019s accountant, to record GST\/HST payable that was not included in the appellant\u2019s GST\/HST filings.\n[21] The Adjustments are not reflected in any of the appellant\u2019s returns filed.[5] Mr. Bajwa offered no explanation for these adjustments (this is considered further in the below paragraphs).\n[22] Mr. Nasrullah did not testify at trial, despite the fact that he resides in Toronto, appears to be the only party able to answer many crucial questions, and still does work for Mr. Bajwa.\nC. Mr. Bajwa\u2019s Testimony\n[23] Mr. Bajwa was born in Pakistan. After moving to and being educated in Germany, he moved to Canada with his family in 2000. He attended high school and college in Canada. He obtained an education in Business studies in both Germany and Canada.\n[24] He opened Encore Cellular in 2005. He began his business by buying mobile phone accessories (such as phone covers). This soon evolved into purchasing and selling cellular telephones and various other related products.\n[25] Specific to the issues in the litigation, Mr. Bajwa testified that when he bought the cellphones, the suppliers were outside of Canada. He testified that the price he paid to his suppliers was a landed price. As per his testimony, this meant he paid all costs for the telephones to the supplier when they arrived at his warehouse, including GST.\n[26] The evidence at trial did not support Mr. Bajwa\u2019s claim of paying a landed price. Instances were provided in his testimony in which Encore Cellular Inc. paid additional fees upon receiving the goods in Canada. Also, no receipts or contracts or any other corroborating documents were provided that support the contention that a landed price was negotiated.\n[27] Overall, it was very hard to determine the terms and conditions of the purchase of the goods bought by the appellant. Many business records were missing. Mr. Bajwa testified that in numerous instances he agreed to the terms of buying products from his suppliers by way of a telephone call, and advanced funds based upon the call with his supplier. In these instances there were no records to support the details of his purchases (or if they occurred). The only evidence we have is money being sent by the appellant to the foreign supplier. I do not know how many times this occurred, but it does appear it was a significant amount.\n[28] Mr. Bajwa hired Mr. Nasrullah to prepare his GST returns. Mr. Nasrullah was at that time and still is a family friend. His accounting services were done at year end. At that time, the appellant provided Mr. Nasrullah with Encore\u2019s bank statements. From these Mr. Nasrullah would prepare the appellant\u2019s general ledgers. He would also prepare the GST filings. Mr. Bajwa testified that he relied upon the accountant\u2019s work entirely to calculate and remit the proper GST amounts owing for the appellant.\n[29] Mr. Bajwa was clear in his testimony that he had no knowledge of the accounting practices of Encore.\n[30] Furthermore, the appellant did no bookkeeping on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Rather the accounting was done at year end by Mr. Nasrullah.\nQ: Okay. Now, can you tell me, did you do any bookkeeping for Encore during the relevant period?\nA: No. I have no experience on bookkeeping.\nQ: You did no bookkeeping for Encore?\nA: No.\nQ: Who did the bookkeeping?\nA: No one.\nQ: No one did any bookkeeping for Encore?\nA: No.[6]\n[31] Concerning the general ledger, Mr. Bajwa testified that he did not understand the general ledger, and could offer no explanation as to its contents. Mr. Bajwa was clear that, even in preparing for trial, he did not ask Mr. Nasrullah, nor inform himself in any way, as to why the general ledger and the GST\/HST filings were inconsistent.\nMR. TARIQ: Mr. Bajwa, if the general ledger and the tax return don't match, could you explain why they wouldn't match?\nA: I can't explain that because I'm not an accountant.[7]\n\u2026\nAnd\nQ: Here, we have in the table below, the first entry, May 1st, 2009, to April 30th, 2010. You reported a GST collectible amount of $63,753.41. Do you see that?\nA: Yeah.\nQ: Why is that different from the amount that the ledger shows is collected, $69,117.09?\nA: I have no idea. That's answer for -- like, Mr. Nasrullah can answer that. I have no idea. I never have gone to ever from this ledger in my life after that (INDISCERNIBLE) presented to me.[8]\n\u2026\nAnd\nQ: Mr. Nasrullah (sic), would you be able to answer any of the discrepancies in the ledger, between the ledger and the returns?\nA: I can't answer that about that ledger because I have no understanding about this ledger, so \u2026[9]\nAnd\nQ: So, Mr. Bajwa, the Minister found these discrepancies. I've just walked you through the first period, which you were unable to account for. The rest of the -- the discrepancies for each of the period is listed below that in each subsequent row. Can you explain any of these discrepancies?\nA: No. I have no understanding about these things.\nQ: Did you ever ask your accountant why your tax returns don't match your general ledger?\nA: No.\nQ: You never asked?\nA: I never asked. I never knew what general ledger was (INDISCERNIBLE). I never knew that.\nQ: Did you ever seek clarification after the audit?\nA: I was asking him all the time, then he send it -- he say that I'm going to send it to CRA for adjustment or whatever. And after that is, like -- the whole thing start, and then nothing.[10]\n[32] Concerning the underreported GST, at the end of the trial, what I am left with are adjusting entries made by the accountant that seem to indicate that more GST should have been paid to the Minister than was in the appellant\u2019s filings. Furthermore, pursuant to an audit of the general ledger and the bank records, a conclusion was reached by the Minister that the appellant underreported the amount of GST owing.\n[33] The appellant contests the Minister\u2019s position that additional GST should have been paid, but offers absolutely no evidence as to why the general ledger appears to indicate more GST was owing than was remitted. On a more specific basis, no explanation at all was provided by the appellant as to why the adjusting entries were made to the general ledger by Mr. Nasrullah nor how they should be interpreted. Despite being assessed with a large amount of additional GST payable, the appellant has come to court, without Mr. Nasrullah, and uninformed as to the issues before the Court.\n[34] The appellant is therefore unsuccessful on the issue of underreported GST. Subject to my finding concerning the statue barred period of April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2011, this portion of the appeal is unsuccessful.\nD. Evidence of the Appellant Concerning the ITCs Claimed\n[35] In examination in chief, Mr. Bajwa referred to and described various invoices from suppliers outside of Canada. Unfortunately this was not very informative. The appellant at no point walked me through the entirety of a transaction.\n[36] Specifically no evidence was provided as to how much GST was paid when the purchased goods came into Canada.\n[37] Mr. Bajwa provided a sampling of invoices from various suppliers and also provided bank statements showing money being wired from a bank account to a specific supplier. The invoice never indicated GST being paid. Mr. Bajwa could not show me, or offer any evidence, as to what GST was remitted on goods when they came across the border. The appellant simply asked that I estimate the amount of GST paid to be 5% of the amount paid in the USA for the purchases.\n[38] The only time I was walked through the entirety of a transaction, it was done by the respondent in the cross examination of Mr. Bajwa. This was very detrimental to the appellant\u2019s case. In that instance it showed the following:\nAn initial purchase price for cell phones from a supplier in Michigan, indicating that the appellant paid $10,761.73 in US dollars on January 14, 2013. The ITC that would have been claimed on this purchase would have been 13\/113 of the amount, which is $1237 US dollars.[11]\nWhen these cellular telephones were declared at the Canadian border, by a custom broker hired by the appellant, they were declared to be worth $322 Canadian. The actual amount of GST paid for the goods was $15.84.\nThe proper amount to pay to bring the cellular telephones across the border would have been 5% of their value (which is in most cases the amount paid for the item).\nNo explanation was offered by the appellant as to why the value of the purchased goods was undervalued at border.\n[39] This simply demonstrates the importance of 169(4) of the Act. It ensures that ITCs are limited to the amount of GST actually paid.\nE. Mark Hatfield\u2019s Testimony\n[40] Mr. Hatfield is a retired CRA auditor who assisted in the audit of Encore. The appellant called him as a witness.\n[41] In this role he helped prepare several of the working papers relied upon by the Minister in their assessment. The appellant\u2019s counsel called him to support one main proposition. That being, for the purpose of s.180 of the Act, the Minister was satisfied that GST was paid when the supplies in issue were brought into the country. The importance of this point will become obvious upon a review of the requirements of s. 180 of the Act. It should be further pointed out that Mr. Hatfield testified that he did not turn his mind to s. 180 at the time of audit.\n[42] Specifically the appellant relies upon the following testimony of Mr. Hatfield:\nOkay. Generally, goods would not come into Canada without HST or GST or HST. Being from Newfoundland, Labrador, it's HST, and probably here as well. But on commercial goods, the importation's generally five percent, and somebody has to pay tax at the border. Sir -- I mean, if tax is not paid, it's because of some other activity, not -- not normal course of business.[12]\n\u2026\nAnd\nMS. TAYLOR: So you determined that no goods could come into Canada without the GST being paid on it.\nA: Correct. I wouldn't make a 100 percent statement to that effect, but that's the say it's supposed to work, yes.\nQ: And you, in fact, found with respect to the supplies made by the appellant that the customer is basically the importer, and the tax was paid at the border.\nA: I don't recall actually doing the test, but I do know in having reviewed my statement that I made that statement and I -- I certainly can't refute it.\nJUSTICE: What's -- what's the statement again? What -- what's your position that -- was GST paid on these transactions, or --\nA: Well, yeah, that HST was paid by the supplier, the non-registrant, non-resident, that they paid the tax on importation, and by extension, then, the -- the recipient of supply may be entitled to a input tax credit.\nQ: MS. TAYLOR: So, that directly contradicts the allegation that's immediately following that in the amended reply, that no GST, HST was paid on the importation of any goods corresponding to the US account invoices in excess of what was allowed by the Minister.\nA: Yes, what -- what I would have made as a statement is that there was no documentation provided that HST was paid on the importation.[13]\n[43] The appellant relies upon this statement for the proposition that the Minister accepted that evidence exists that is satisfactory to the Minister that the GST tax has been paid by the non resident supplier (a requirement of s. 180 of the Act).\n[44] The respondent denies that the Minister has accepted that GST has been paid and pleads, in paragraph 24 of their Amended Reply: The appellant failed to obtain documentation that contains the information prescribed by section 3 of the Regulations and failed to obtain satisfactory evidence as required by paragraph 180(c) of the Act.\nF. Ganesh Timsina\u2019s Testimony\n[45] Mr. Timsina, a CRA employee, was the Appeals officer on the file. Much of his evidence came by way of cross-examination. Appellant\u2019s counsel clearly hoped to refute the Minister\u2019s various assessing positions through this witness. I do not find that happened. Various points in the examination were confusing. In these instances, either the witness was not understanding the appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s questions or counsel was not understanding the answers provided. Overall, I did not find the evidence to be helpful for either side in making my decision.\nIII. ISSUES\n[46] The remaining issues are:\nDid the Minister correctly disallow the appellant\u2019s claimed ITCs?\nDoes the appellant benefit from the deeming provisions of ss.178.8 or s.180 of the Act?\nWas GST paid on importation in relation to this amount?\nHas the registrant obtained sufficient evidence that will enable the amount of ITC to be determined?\nWas the Minister justified in assessing the appellant for the Statute-Barred Periods of April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2011?\nDid the Minister correctly assess the appellant for a penalty of $161,953.00 pursuant to section 285 of the Act?\nIV. ANALYSIS\nA. General Framework for ITCs\n[47] Subsection 225(1) provides that a taxpayer may deduct ITCs from their net tax calculation. Subsection 169(1) provides the general rule for qualifying for ITCs. ITCs are determined based on the product of 1) GST\/HST paid or payable in a reporting period and 2) the extent to which the supplies are consumed, used or supplied in the course of the registrant\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d.[14] ITCs can be claimed against zero-rated supplies.[15]\n[48] Because these sections were relied upon by the appellant, I will provide analysis concerning s. 178.8 and s. 180 of the Act. Unfortunately for the appellant, my conclusions in this regard will not advance their case. This is because the appellant does not meet the requirement of ss. 169(4), in that the appellant has not, prior to claiming the ITC in their return, obtained sufficient evidence to enable the proper amount of the ITC to be determined.\n[49] The respondent has assumed, at paragraph 13(n) of the Amended Reply, that no GST\/HST was paid by the foreign suppliers, nor was GST\/HST paid on the importation of any goods corresponding to the US account invoices, in excess of what was allowed by the Minister. Even when considering the testimony of Mr. Hatfield, I do not find that this assumption has been destroyed.\nB. Paying GST\/HST on Import and Sections 178.8 and 180\n[50] Sections 178.8 and 180 of the Act are special case provisions, which deem persons to have paid tax, potentially entitling them to qualify for ITCs.[16]\n[51] The pertinent text of s. 178.8 as it stood during the Relevant Periods is reproduced below:\nDefinition of specified supply\n178.8 (1) In this section, specified supply means a supply of goods that\n(a) are, at any time after the supply is made, imported; or\n(b) have been imported in circumstances in which section 144 deems the supply to have been made outside Canada.\nDeemed importer of goods\n(2) Subject to subsections (4) and (7), if a recipient of a specified supply of goods made outside Canada does not, at any time before the release of the goods, supply the goods outside Canada and the recipient or any other person imported the goods for consumption, use or supply by the recipient (in this section referred to as the \u201cconstructive importer\u201d), the constructive importer is deemed to have so imported the goods, and any amount paid or payable as or on account of tax on the goods under Division III in respect of the importation is deemed to have been paid or payable, as the case may be, by or on behalf of the constructive importer and not by or on behalf of any other person\u2026[17]\n[52] Subsections 178.8(8) and (9) provide various exceptions to the application of 178.8(2). None of these exceptions appear to be relevant to this appeal except that when section 180 applies, subsection 178.8(2) does not apply.[18]\n[53] Section 178.8 is designed to provide relief in a circumstance where a non-resident sells a supply to a Canadian registrant whereby legal delivery occurs outside Canada, but the Canadian registrant does not import the supply into Canada.[19] In such a circumstance, the non-resident would be required to pay GST\/HST on import, but the non-resident might not be able to qualify for ITCs. Section 178.8 provides the possibility of qualifying for an ITC to the Canadian purchaser by deeming the Canadian purchaser as having paid GST\/HST on import to prevent double payment of GST\/HST in what is effectively commercial activity.\n[54] I am unable to apply section 178.8 to deem the appellant to have paid tax on import. This section only deems tax to have been paid or payable to the extent that tax was in fact paid or payable on importation. As noted above, the respondent\u2019s assumption that no GST\/HST was paid upon importation stands.\n[55] Appellant\u2019s counsel argues that I can calculate the GST\/HST amount paid by accepting Mr. Nasrullah\u2019s review of the bank statements, from which he calculated the amount paid to foreign suppliers. In order to get these foreign purchased goods into Canada, GST of 5% should have been paid at the border.\n[56] If I were to ignore the respondent\u2019s assumption noted above, there is still too much uncertainty to accept the calculation proposed by the appellant. For one, I have no idea as to what the declared value of the goods purchased from the non resident was when they were brought into Canada. This greatly affects the GST paid. Other obvious uncertainties also exist. These include the fact that, in many instances, given the lack of invoices, no evidence has been lead as to the details concerning the relevant transactions when the appellant sent the funds to the U.S. supplier, such as what was purchased and how much was paid for each item.\nC. Section 180\n[57] The text of s.180 reads as follows:\nReceipt of property from non-resident\n180 For the purposes of determining an input tax credit of, or the amount of a rebate payable under section 259 or 260 to, a particular person, where a non-resident person who is not registered under Subdivision D of Division V\n(a) either\n(i) makes a supply of tangible personal property to the particular person and delivers the property, or makes it available, in Canada to the particular person before the property is used in Canada by or on behalf of the non-resident person, or\n(ii) where the particular person is a registrant, causes physical possession of tangible personal property to be transferred in Canada to the particular person in circumstances in which the particular person is acquiring physical possession of the property for the purpose of making a taxable supply of a commercial service in respect of the property to the non-resident person,\n(b) has paid tax under Division III in respect of the importation of the property or has paid tax in respect of a supply of the property deemed under subsection 179(1) to have been made by a registrant, and\n(c) provides to the particular person evidence, satisfactory to the Minister, that the tax has been paid,\nthe particular person shall be deemed\n(d) to have paid, at the time the non-resident person paid that tax, tax in respect of a supply of the property to the particular person equal to that tax, and\n(e) in a case described in subparagraph (a)(ii), to have acquired the property for use exclusively in commercial activities of the particular person.[20]\n[58] As described in the technical notes, the purpose of s.180 is to prevent GST from being paid twice due to a non-resident in the billing chain having paid tax without being able to claim ITCs.\n[59] Section 180 provides relief where legal delivery occurs in Canada, but the non-resident pays GST\/HST on import.\n[60] One important difference between subsection 178.8(2) and section 180 is that section 180, unlike subsection 178.8(2), requires evidence satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid.\n[61] The CRA has provided that for the purposes of section 180:\n\u201cSatisfactory proof includes a copy of Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Form B3-3, Canada Customs Coding Form, showing that the GST or the federal part of the HST was paid at the time of import.\u201d[21]\n[62] It was clear, based on the evidence of Mr. Hatfield, as well as the working papers that were put in evidence, that s.180 was not considered at the audit or objection stage. The section was only added, in the amended Notice of Appeal, well into the litigation process (in fact the trial of this matter was adjourned, in part, to allow the appellant to amend pleadings and add this argument). The Minister clearly did not turn their mind to this provision until late in the litigation process.\n[63] Mr. Hatfield\u2019s statement at trial does not bind the Minister. He did not state that he accepted, at audit, that \u201cthe non-resident provides the taxpayer with evidence that is satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid.\u201d He testified that he felt that the GST should have been paid at the border. He also testified that the issue was probably the lack of records.\n[64] Despite the able and creative submissions from appellant\u2019s counsel, I do not find that the Minister concluded that evidence that is satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid exists. The Amended Notice of Reply states the respondent\u2019s position. The lack of records, or any evidence, concerning the transaction on which the ITCs are claimed supports their position. Even if it were in my authority, I would not override the Minister\u2019s discretion on this point. I therefore find that section 180 does not apply.\n[65] If I am wrong, and section 180 does apply, I still am unable to allow the appeal and allow the ITCs the appellant seeks. This is because, as set out below, the appellant fails to meet the requirements of s. 169 of the Act.\nD. Requirements to Qualify for ITCs\n[66] As described above, the appellant admitted at the outset of trial that the ITCs claimed were incorrect. This error was a result of a flawed methodology. In determining the ITCs (in issue) the appellant used bank statements to identify purchases, and then applied a 13\/113 calculation to determine the ITCs. Given that these ITCs relate to goods purchased from non-registrants in the United States, the only GST that would have been paid was 5%, incurred when importing the goods into Canada. This concession by the appellant reduced the input tax credit claim in issue at trial from the aggregate amount of $474,816 to $182,622.\n[67] As the appellant\u2019s counsel stated in her submission, she comes to Tax Court with imperfect evidence. Some purchase invoices were put into evidence. The appellant in many instances purchased goods simply based on a telephone call. In these instances, no supporting documents exists.\n[68] The other documents that should have been presented at trial, or at least evidence of their content, would be the CBSA remittance forms, showing how much GST was paid when purchased items came over the border. But for one instance, these forms were not present. This lack of evidence makes it very difficult to find in the appellant\u2019s favour.\n[69] The foreign supplier invoices in evidence did not show GST being paid. There is no documentation showing GST being paid, nor has evidence been provided of specific GST being paid that relates to an ITC claim. It is my conclusion, as I review the lack of evidence of this case, that I am unable to even allow a portion of the ITCs in issue.\n[70] For the reasons set out below, the lack of evidence from the appellant concerning the payment of GST by the non-registrants is fatal to their case.\nE. General Description Concerning Recovery of ITCs\n[71] Generally speaking, a business carrying on commercial activity can recover the GST or HST it incurs through ITCs. The effect is to make the transactions tax neutral.\n[72] As noted above, if either section 178.8 or section 180 applies, and the appellant is deemed to have paid the amount of tax paid or payable, the appellant would still need to meet specific evidentiary requirements to qualify for ITCs. These requirements are provided in the Act and in the ITC Regulations.[22] The relevant provisions for the purposes of determining the necessary documentation to qualify for ITCs are as follows:\n169 \u2026\nRequired documentation\n(4) A registrant may not claim an input tax credit for a reporting period unless, before filing the return in which the credit is claimed,\n(a) the registrant has obtained sufficient evidence in such form containing such information as will enable the amount of the input tax credit to be determined, including any such information as may be prescribed; and\n(b) where the credit is in respect of property or a service supplied to the registrant in circumstances in which the registrant is required to report the tax payable in respect of the supply in a return filed with the Minister under this Part, the registrant has so reported the tax in a return filed under this Part.\u201d[23]\nIn these Regulations,\n\u2026\nsupporting documentation means the form in which information prescribed by section 3 is contained, and includes\n(a) an invoice,\n(b) a receipt,\n(c) a credit-card receipt,\n(d) a debit note,\n(e) a book or ledger of account,\n(f) a written contract or agreement,\n(g) any record contained in a computerized or electronic retrieval or data storage system, and\n(h) any other document validly issued or signed by a registrant in respect of a supply made by the registrant in respect of which there is tax paid or payable;\n\u2026\nPrescribed Information\n(3) For the purposes of paragraph 169(4)(a) of the Act, the following information is prescribed information:\n(a) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is less than $30,\n(i) the name of the supplier or the intermediary in respect of the supply, or the name under which the supplier or the intermediary does business,\n(ii) where an invoice is issued in respect of the supply or the supplies, the date of the invoice,\n(iii) where an invoice is not issued in respect of the supply or the supplies, the date on which there is tax paid or payable in respect thereof, and\n(iv) the total amount paid or payable for all of the supplies;\n(b) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is $30 or more and less than $150,\n(i) the name of the supplier or the intermediary in respect of the supply, or the name under which the supplier or the intermediary does business, and the registration number assigned under section 241 of the Act to the supplier or the intermediary, as the case may be,\n(ii) the information set out in subparagraphs (a)(ii) to (iv),\n(iii) where the amount paid or payable for the supply or the supplies does not include the amount of tax paid or payable in respect thereof,\n(A) the amount of tax paid or payable in respect of each supply or in respect of all of the supplies, or\n(B) where provincial sales tax is payable in respect of each taxable supply that is not a zero-rated supply and is not payable in respect of any exempt supply or zero-rated supply,\n(I) the total of the tax paid or payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act and the provincial sales tax paid or payable in respect of each taxable supply, and a statement to the effect that the total in respect of each taxable supply includes the tax paid or payable under that Division, or\n(II) the total of the tax paid or payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act and the provincial sales tax paid or payable in respect of all taxable supplies, and a statement to the effect that the total includes the tax paid or payable under that Division,\n(iv) where the amount paid or payable for the supply or the supplies includes the amount of tax paid or payable in respect thereof and one or more supplies are taxable supplies that are not zero-rated supplies,\n(A) a statement to the effect that tax is included in the amount paid or payable for each taxable supply,\n(B) the total (referred to in this paragraph as the \u201ctotal tax rate\u201d) of the rates at which tax was paid or payable in respect of each of the taxable supplies that is not a zero-rated supply, and\n(C) the amount paid or payable for each such supply or the total amount paid or payable for all such supplies to which the same total tax rate applies, and\n(v) where the status of two or more supplies is different, an indication of the status of each taxable supply that is not a zero-rated supply; and\n(c) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is $150 or more,\n(i) the information set out in paragraphs (a) and (b),\n(ii) the recipient\u2019s name, the name under which the recipient does business or the name of the recipient\u2019s duly authorized agent or representative,\n(iii) the terms of payment, and\n(iv) a description of each supply sufficient to identify it.[24]\n[73] Put succinctly, ss. 169(4) provides that an ITC cannot be successfully claimed unless the registrant has obtained sufficient evidence as will enable the amount of the ITC to be determined. That simply does not exist in this case.\n[74] I have come to this conclusion, even in light of reviewing the recent decision of Fiera Foods[25], wherein the following was stated concerning 169(4):\n[278] Reading the words of paragraph 169(4)(a) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, the paragraph prohibits a person from claiming an input tax credit unless the person has, prior to claiming the input tax credit in a return, obtained sufficient evidence in such form containing such information (including any prescribed information) as enables the amount of the input tax credit to be determined.\n[279] The clear focus of the paragraph is not the form of the evidence as such, which is unspecified, but the requirement that the evidence include the information necessary to determine the amount of the input tax credit. This information includes any information prescribed by the Information Regulations.\n[280] The French version of paragraph 169(4)(a) makes this point more succinctly when it states:\n(4) L\u2019inscrit peut demander un cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants pour une p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration si, avant de produire la d\u00e9claration \u00e0 cette fin:\na) il obtient les renseignements suffisants pour \u00e9tablir le montant du cr\u00e9dit, y compris les renseignements vis\u00e9s par r\u00e8glement;\n[281] The French text simply requires that the person claiming the input tax credit obtain information (including prescribed information) sufficient to establish the amount of the input tax credit.[26]\n[75] Thus, the appellant must have obtained sufficient evidence to demonstrate the amount of ITCs claimed is correct. As noted above, that has not occurred in this matter.\n[76] What has been put in evidence is a portion of invoices. I have no indication as to what GST was paid to the Minister, if any, on these transactions. I do not accept that a review of the appellant\u2019s bank statements indicating money being paid to non-registrant foreign sellers is sufficient to calculate the ITCs.\n[77] The only complete record I have of the transactions in issue, as described in paragraph 38 above, indicates that the appellant claimed far more ITCs than he was entitled to. This is on only one transaction. However, it does indicate the importance of sufficient evidence to determine the amount of ITCs the appellant is entitled to.\n[78] I therefore must deny the appeal concerning the ITCs.\nF. Was the Minister Entitled to Reassess the Appellant for the Statute-Barred Years?\n[79] Under the Act, the Minister generally cannot reassess a taxpayer more than four years after the later of 1) the date in which a taxpayer was required to file a return under section 238 or 2) the day the return was actually filed.[27] However, subsection 298(4) of the Act provides an exception for statute-barred years where the taxpayer filed a waiver with respect to the year, committed fraud in making its return or \u201cmade a misrepresentation that is attributable to the person\u2019s neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d[28] The respondent admits that the reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 are statute-barred.[29]\n[80] The language in this provision is nearly identical to the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply the same broad principles in determining whether the Minister is justified in reassessing a taxpayer in a statute-barred year.\n[81] We must determine whether the appellant made a \u201cmisrepresentation attributable to \u2026 neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d The threshold to meet the misrepresentation requirement is low and it is generally met if a taxpayer made a false statement on their return.[30]\n[82] Citing Venne, the Court in Reluxicorp found that \u201c[t]here will be negligence where the respondent establishes that the appellant did not exercise reasonable care.\u201d[31] Similarly, \u201cthere will be carelessness if the person failed to make reasonable efforts to comply with the Act.\u201d[32] In MF Electric, the Court cited Regina Shoppers for the principle \u201cthat the care that must be exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct.\u201d[33] This standard is lower than what is required to establish gross negligence.[34]\n[83] Courts have consistently found that taxpayers cannot avoid being found negligent or careless merely because they relied on their accountant.[35]\n[84] The specific amounts in issue in the Statute-Barred Periods are:\nPeriod ending April 30, 2010\n- GST\/HST remittable as filed $63,753.41\n- ITCs as filed $64,755.20;\n- Net tax as filed was negative $1,001.79.\n- As a result of the audit adjustments, which I accept were correct, an additional GST of $5,363.68 should have been remitted;\n- The over claim of ITCs was $6,379.79. There was an additional ITC audit adjustment of $2,069.77.\n- The total audit adjustment was $13,813.24.\nPeriod ending April 30, 2011\n- GST\/HST remittable as filed $157,840\n- ITCs as filed $149,686;\n- Net tax as filed was $8,154.\n- As a result of the audit adjustments, which I accept were correct, an additional GST of $.25 should have been remitted;\n- The over claim of ITCs was calculated in two amounts $7,450.77 (from the US account), $9855.46 (from the RPW account) and an additional ITC adjustment of $10,977.71.\n- The total audit adjustment was $28,284.19.\n[85] I find that the appellant was, at a bare minimum, careless in the Statute-Barred Periods. I rely upon the following factors:\ni)No contemporaneous bookkeeping was performed. The methodology used by the appellant, involving a yearly calculation using bank statements, certainly would lead to an incorrect amount for both the GST\/HST that had to be remitted as well as the ITCs claimed;\nii)ITCs were claimed based on a 13\/113 calculation which lead to a vast over claim;\niii)No proper records were obtained to support the ITCs claimed.\n[86] Therefore I find that the appellant, in not keeping proper books and records, and using a methodology to calculate the ITCs that was plainly wrong, was negligent or careless. The Minister was therefore able to reopen the periods ending April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011.\nG. Section 285 Penalty in the Amount of $161,953.00\n[87] Section 285 of the Act imposes penalties on taxpayers who \u201cknowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, makes or participates in, assents to or acquiesces in the making of a false statement or omissions in a return\u2026\u201d The quoted text and purpose of section 285 is nearly identical to the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act and courts apply the same general principles under both provisions.[36] The appellant does not bear the burden to \u201cdemolish\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions for the purposes of penalties under section 285 of the Act.[37]\n[88] The \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cgross negligence\u201d requirements under section 285 are not conjunctive and the Minister may meet its onus by establishing either requirement.[38] The Tax Court in Fiera Foods found that \u201c[a] \u2018false statement\u2019 is a statement in a return that is untrue and an \u2018omission\u2019 is something that is left out of a return.\u201d[39] To apply a section 285 penalty, the Minister must establish that the appellant made the false statement 1) knowingly or in circumstances amounting to 2) gross negligence.\n(i) Gross Negligence\n[89] The FCA found that unreported taxable income \u201cdoes not inevitably lead to a conclusion that a gross negligence penalty [or reopening a statute-barred year] is justified.\u201d[40] However, if the taxpayer does not provide a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy then a trial judge \u201ccan draw the inference that the taxpayer was grossly negligent\u201d if 1) such an inference is reasonable and 2) the evidence does \u201cnot allow for a different explanation.\u201d[41]\n[90] The following principle from Venne was affirmed by the SCC in Guindon: \u201c\u2018Gross negligence\u2019 must be taken to involve greater neglect than simply a failure to use reasonable care. It must involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, an indifference to as to whether the law is complied with or not.\u201d[42]\n[91] The burden \u201cis closer to the criminal onus under the Criminal Code than it is to a balance of probabilities.\u201d[43] The extent of a taxpayer\u2019s knowledge of business and tax matters is a factor in determining if they were grossly negligent.[44]\n(ii) Knowingly\n[92] To meet the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement, the Minister must establish that the taxpayer had \u201csubjective knowledge\u201d that it was making a false statement on a tax return. Because a taxpayer will typically not admit that it had knowledge that it was making a false statement, this requirement is often established by demonstrating that the taxpayer was either wilfully blind or that it ought to have known that the return contained false information. The Court in Torres outlined the following principles to apply in determining if a taxpayer was wilfully blind:\na) Knowledge of a false statement can be imputed by wilful blindness.\nb) The concept of wilful blindness can be applied to gross negligence penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act and it is appropriate to do so in the cases before me.\nc) In determining wilful blindness, consideration must be given to the education and experience of the taxpayer.\nd) To find wilful blindness there must be a need or a suspicion for an inquiry.\ne) Circumstances that would indicate a need for an inquiry prior to filing, or flashing red lights as I called it in the Bhatti decision, include the following:\ni) the magnitude of the advantage or omission;\nii) the blatantness of the false statement and how readily detectable it is;\niii) the lack of acknowledgment by the tax preparer who prepared the return in the return itself;\niv) unusual requests made by the tax preparer;\nv) the tax preparer being previously unknown to the taxpayer;\nvi) incomprehensible explanations by the tax preparer;\nvii) whether others engaged the tax preparer or warned against doing so, or the taxpayer himself or herself expresses concern about telling others.\nf) The final requirement for wilful blindness is that the taxpayer makes no inquiry of the tax preparer to understand the return, nor makes any inquiry of a third party, nor the CRA itself.[45]\n[93] In determining whether penalties should apply, I cannot find any reason why any individual reporting period before me is distinct from another. Therefore, I will deal with all the reporting periods as one. I rely upon the following facts, to support my conclusion that penalties were properly assessed in this instance:\nThe appellant admitted that they used an improper method to calculate GST. This lead to a trial admission by the appellant that ITCs were over claimed in the amount of $292,194 (see paragraph 66)[46] and an overall denial of ITCs in this decision amounting to $474,816;\nThe appellant underreported GST\/HST remittable for the periods in the amount of $114,032.56;\nBased upon the adjustments made to the appellant\u2019s general ledger concerning the GST\/HST payable, I find the appellant had knowledge that these amounts were underreported and did not correct these errors;\nThe net tax adjustment of $646,784.27 is material, and relates directly to the appellant improperly claiming ITCs and underreporting GST\/HST payable;\nProper books and records were both not obtained (in many instances) or were not kept to support the GST\/HST filings;\nMr. Bajwa, the sole shareholder and president of the appellant, was an experienced businessperson, educated, and had the services of an accountant. Related to this finding, the appellant has been involved in the importing and exporting of goods for a number of years, and most likely has knowledge of the tax consequences of these transactions;\nI did not find Mr. Bajwa\u2019s evidence concerning his lack of knowledge concerning the accounting of the appellant\u2019s business, or its reporting requirements, to be credible;\nThe evidence of Mr. Bajwa was that he made no inquiry of his accountant, who prepared his taxes, to understand his return, or his tax obligations. Furthermore no evidence was lead that he made any inquiries of third parties to inform himself;\nIn the only instance of documentation showing the amount of GST paid in bringing goods into Canada, the appellant\u2019s agent vastly understated the value of the goods as being $322 instead of $10,761.73 US;\n[94] Based on the above factors, I find that the appellant was either willfully blind or grossly negligent.\n[95] The appellant has relied upon a case, Bandula, for the proposition that the respondent has not properly plead the correctness of the computation of the penalty amount. Much the same as was found in Bandula, I am satisfied that the Minister sufficiently pleaded the subsection 163(2) penalties and indicated how and why same would apply. Further, any deficiency in those pleadings or failure to lead evidence ought not to have been reserved by the appellant until reply submissions.[47]\nV. CONCLUSION\n[96] Based upon the reasons set out above, the Appeal is denied in its entirety. Costs are payable by the appellant.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 14th day of March 2024.\n\u201cR.

Introduction [1] Mr. Volodymyr Bykov (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals reassessments of his 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cReassessments\u201d). The Reassessments reduced or denied certain expenses that the Appellant claimed in respect of his employment during his 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cTaxation Years\u201d).\n[2] The Appellant filed a separate notice of appeal for each of the four Taxation Years. With the consent of the parties, the four appeals were heard together on common evidence.\n[3] The legal issues raised by these appeals result from the distinctions in the Income Tax Act (Canada)[1] (the \u201cITA\u201d) between income from a source that is an office or employment and income from a source that is a business. Subsection 8(2) expressly limits the amounts that may be deducted by a taxpayer in respect of an office or employment to the amounts that are permitted by section 8.\n[4] The parties agreed that the Appellant was employed by four separate employers in 2015 and three separate employers in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (individually, an \u201cEmployer\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cEmployers\u201d).[2] I confirmed with counsel for the Appellant that the Appellant was not taking the position that during the Taxation Years the Appellant was an independent contractor rather than an employee.\nII. The Facts [5] The Appellant testified on his own behalf. I found the Appellant to be a credible witness.\n[6] The Respondent did not call any witnesses.\n[7] The Respondent set out in the four Replies to the four Notices of Appeal filed by the Appellant the assumptions of fact made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) when reassessing each of the Taxation Years. Rather than repeating all of the assumptions of fact here, I have reproduced them in Appendices A to D of these reasons for judgment.\n[8] I must accept the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact as true unless the Appellant meets his evidentiary burden to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions.[3]\n[9] The Appellant testified that he is a visiting registered nurse who provides nursing services to individuals in their own home, or in a retirement or nursing home. The majority of the Appellant\u2019s patients are in palliative care.\n[10] During the Taxation Years, the Appellant provided nursing services six days one week and four days the next week on a rotating basis. Each week included two or three seven-hour night shifts during which the Appellant was on standby for patients that required urgent care during the night.\n[11] Each evening prior to a workday, the Employers would provide the Appellant with a schedule of the individuals that he was to visit the following day (I will refer to these individuals as \u201cpatients\u201d). The Appellant estimated that he visited between 10 and 30 patients during a day shift and that he worked on average of 40 to 45 hours per week plus the two to three seven-hour night shifts.\n[12] A visit to a patient could involve any of a number of nursing services provided by the Appellant depending on the needs of the patient. A visit could also involve consultation with one or more members of the patient\u2019s family.\n[13] The Employers paid the Appellant a fixed amount for each patient visit regardless of the nursing services provided by the Appellant. For example, the terms of employment with S.R.T. Med-Staff in Exhibit A-4 state under the heading \u201cWages, Benefits and Vacation\u201d:\nAs a nurse working in the community you are paid by the client visit at a rate of $36.00 per visit, less any applicable statutory and other deductions.\n[14] The Appellant lived in Bradford, Ontario and travelled from there to visit the patients. The Employers did not provide the Appellant with a place to work and required the Appellant to have a car, a cell phone and a home office with a fax machine and office supplies.\n[15] The Appellant testified that he maintained an office in his home that occupied most of the basement (the \u201chome office\u201d). The Appellant used the home office to hold telephone consultations with other medical professionals (e.g., doctors) regarding patients, to store medical supplies provided by the Employers, and to store the medical records of patients under the Appellant\u2019s care.\n[16] The Appellant stated that the patients\u2019 medical records were confidential and that he was required to store the records securely in an area of his home office with restricted access.\n[17] The Appellant submitted copies of the T2200 forms issued by the Employers for each of the Taxation Years (collectively, the \u201cT2200s\u201d).[4] The T2200 forms issued by Spectrum show home office use of 15 percent for all of the Taxation Years and the T2200 forms issued by S.R.T. Med-Staff show home office use of 30 percent for all of the Taxation Years. The T2200 forms issued by ParaMed show home office use of \u201c50%\u201d for 2015, \u201c<40%\u201d for 2016, \u201c40%\u201d for 2017 and \u201cless than 50%\u201d for 2018.\n[18] Section 5 of the T2200s indicate that ParaMed and Spectrum gave the Appellant a motor vehicle allowance, which the Appellant testified was less than the per kilometer amount accepted by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) as a reasonable automobile allowance. The Appellant stated that he deducted the difference as an employment expense.\n[19] Section 5 of the T2200 forms issued to the Appellant by Spectrum for the Taxation Years states that the Appellant\u2019s motor vehicle allowance was calculated on a per visit basis rather than a per kilometer basis. The allowances for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $8,008.80, $7715.35, $7,501 and $5,995.95, respectively. The T2200 forms indicate that these amounts were not included on the Appellant\u2019s T4s for the Taxation Years.\n[20] Section 5 of the T2200 forms issued by ParaMed for the Taxation Years states that the motor vehicle allowance was 0.38 cents per kilometer. The allowances for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $502.51, $1,097.22, $651.01, and $369.67, respectively. Section 5 of the T2200 form for 2018 also identifies $5.30 as a fixed motor vehicle allowance that was included on the Appellant\u2019s T4 for that year.\n[21] On the T2200s, each Employer answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201cDid you require this employee to be away for at least 12 consecutive hours from the municipality and metropolitan area (if there is one) of your business where the employee normally reported to work?\u201d[5] and \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cDid you normally require this employee to travel to locations that were not your place of business or between different locations of your places of business, during the course of performing his or her employment duties?\u201d.[6]\n[22] The Appellant testified that because his wife\u2019s name was on the insurance policy the CRA allowed only one-half of the cost of his motor vehicle insurance even though his wife did not have a driver\u2019s licence. The Appellant did not submit evidence in support of the quantum of the motor vehicle insurance premium.\n[23] The Appellant testified that he maintained records of his employment activities and expenses including a time log showing the time spent performing his employment duties and a mileage log showing his motor vehicle use for employment. The Appellant testified that he provided the records to the CRA by registered mail.[7]\n[24] The Appellant did not provide the Court with a copy of any records or logs, and also did not provide the Court with documentary evidence regarding the sending of records to the CRA by registered mail. The Appellant testified that he received letters from the CRA stating that the CRA did not receive the records.[8]\n[25] The Appellant provided the Court with a copy of a T777 Comparative Summary of Employment Expenses that covered the Taxation Years.[9] The T777 form, in conjunction with the Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the form,[10] is evidence of the employment related expenses claimed by the Appellant for the Taxation Years, but it is not evidence in support of the quantum of those expenses.\n[26] In cross-examination, the Appellant agreed with counsel for the Respondent that his employment by the Employers did not require or involve the selling of property or the negotiating of contracts for the Employers.\nA. Position of the Parties (1) The Appellant [27] The Appellant submits that he was a commissioned employee because he was paid on a per patient visit basis and that he is entitled to deduct the expenses that he claimed for the Taxation Years.\n[28] With respect to the use of the home office, the percentages on the T2200s issued by the Employers add up to more than 50 percent and therefore the condition in paragraph 8(13)(a) is satisfied.\n(2) The Respondent [29] The Respondent submits that the Appellant was a salaried employee and denies the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to a deduction of expenses greater than the expenses allowed by the Reassessments.\n[30] The Appellant was not employed in connection with the selling of property or the negotiation of contracts and therefore the deductions permitted by paragraph 8(1)(f) do not apply to the Appellant.\n[31] Contrary to the position of the Appellant, the use of a home office must be determined for each office or employment and the percentage of use for each of the three separate employments in issue in these appeals cannot be aggregated.\n[32] All but one of the T2200s indicates home office use by the Appellant of less than 50 percent and the remaining form indicates home office use of exactly 50 percent in 2015. This use does not satisfy the condition in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i).\n[33] The Appellant received a non-taxable automobile allowance from ParaMed and Spectrum and the additional motor vehicle related amounts claimed by the Appellant were not deductible under section 8.\nIII. Analysis [34] Generally speaking, an individual that carries on a business is entitled to deduct any reasonable expense that is not on account of capital and that is incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business. In contrast, under subsection 8(2), an employee may deduct only those expenses that are permitted by section 8.\n[35] The provisions of the ITA that are relevant to these appeals are paragraphs 6(1)(b), 8(1)(f), (i), (h), (h.1) and (j) and subsections 8(2) and (13). I have reproduced these provisions in Appendix E to these reasons for judgment and will refer to them as required for clarity.\n[36] The Appellant submits that paragraph 8(1)(f) applies to the expenses he incurred in respect of his employment by the Employers. The introductory words of paragraph 8(1)(f) state the following condition that must be met for the paragraph to apply to the Appellant:\nwhere the taxpayer was employed in the year in connection with the selling of property or negotiating of contracts for the taxpayer\u2019s employer, and \u2026\n[37] The Appellant is a registered nurse who provides nursing services to patients and who is compensated for those services on a per patient visit basis. The Appellant acknowledged that he did not sell property or negotiate contracts for the Employers.\n[38] Based on the opening words of subparagraph 8(1)(f) read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense,[11] the Appellant does not qualify for the deductions permitted by that paragraph because during the Taxation Years the Appellant did not sell property or negotiate contracts for the Employers.\n[39] The technical notes issued in May 1991 that accompanied a proposed amendment of paragraph 8(1)(f)[12] state, in part:\nParagraph 8(1)(f) permits a commissioned salesperson to deduct amounts expended for the purpose of earning income from employment, where the salesperson was not in receipt of a non-taxable travel allowance and was required by the contract of employment to pay his or her expenses and carry on the duties of employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[40] The purpose of paragraph 8(1)(f) is to allow a salesperson to deduct expenses related to the activities of selling and negotiating contracts provided certain additional conditions are satisfied such as payment by commission. The fact that the Appellant was paid by the Employers on a per visit basis does not bring the Appellant within the scope of paragraph 8(1)(f). The Appellant\u2019s nursing duties are simply not the kind of employment duties contemplated by paragraph 8(1)(f).\n[41] Subparagraphs 8(1)(i)(ii) and (iii) allow a deduction for office rent and supplies consumed in the performance of an employment, respectively. The Appellant did not suggest that he paid office rent, and the supplies consumed by the Appellant in the performance of his nursing duties were provided by the Employers. Therefore, the only supplies that would fall under subparagraph 8(1)(i)(iii) are miscellaneous office supplies. The Appellant did not provide evidence of the quantum of expenditures on miscellaneous office supplies.\n[42] Even if an expenditure was proven and satisfied the requirements of paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i), the amount may not be deductible because of subsection 8(13). This is because subsection 8(13) provides that no amount is deductible under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i) unless specified conditions are met. Paragraph 8(13)(a) states:\nNotwithstanding paragraphs (1)(f) and (i),\n(a) no amount is deductible in computing an individual\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment in respect of any part (in this subsection referred to as the \u201cwork space\u201d) of a self-contained domestic establishment in which the individual resides, except to the extent that the work space is either\n(i) the place where the individual principally performs the duties of the office or employment, or\n(ii) used exclusively during the period in respect of which the amount relates for the purpose of earning income from the office or employment and used on a regular and continuous basis for meeting customers or other persons in the ordinary course of performing the duties of the office or employment;\n[Emphasis added.]\n[43] With respect to the Appellant\u2019s employment by each of the Employers, the condition in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) requires that he principally perform the duties of his employment at his home office.\n[44] The word \u201cprincipally\u201d is an adverb that is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online) to mean \u201cFor the most or greater part; in most cases; in the main; mostly.\u201d The word connotes an action that is greater than 50 percent of all relevant actions. This is the meaning adopted in the tax case law.[13]\n[45] The nature of the Appellant\u2019s employment activities\u2014caring for patients in their home, or in a nursing or retirement home\u2014strongly suggests that the greater part of the Appellant\u2019s employment activities do not take place at his home office. Rather, the Appellant\u2019s use of his home office is ancillary to and in support of the performance of his nursing duties at other locations.\n[46] This general observation is confirmed by the T2200s, which indicate home office use in respect of employment by Spectrum of 15 percent for all of the Taxation Years, home office use in respect of employment by S.R.T. Med-Staff of 30 percent for all of the Taxation Years, and home office use in respect of employment by ParaMed of \u201c50%\u201d for 2015, \u201c<40%\u201d for 2016, \u201c40%\u201d for 2017 and \u201cless than 50%\u201d for 2018.\n[47] Contrary to the position asserted by the Appellant, the \u201cprincipally\u201d requirement in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) applies separately to each employment[14] and, therefore, the percentages shown on the T2200s cannot simply be added together. I note that even if the employments were addressed on an aggregate basis, based on the T2200s the total home office activity would always be 50 percent or less of all relevant activity because at no time does the percentage of home office activity for an Employer exceed 50 percent of total activity.\n[48] Subparagraph 8(13)(a)(ii) has two conditions. First, the home office must be used by the Appellant exclusively for the purpose of earning income from employment. Secondly, the home office must be used by the Appellant on a regular and continuous basis for meeting customers or other persons in the ordinary course of performing the Appellant\u2019s employment duties. The Appellant did not suggest that he satisfied the second condition and there is no evidence to indicate that the second condition was satisfied. Telephone conferences participated in by the Appellant from the home office do not qualify as using the home office to meet customers or other persons.\n[49] Based on the foregoing, even if the Appellant was entitled to a deduction for home office expenses under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i), the deduction would be denied because the Appellant does not satisfy the requirements of either subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) or 8(13)(a)(ii).\n[50] The remaining provisions in issue are paragraphs 8(1)(h), (h.1) and (j). Paragraph 8(1)(h) addresses travel expenses other than motor vehicle expenses, paragraph 8(1)(h.1) addresses motor vehicle expenses, and paragraph 8(1)(j) addresses the cost of acquiring a motor vehicle (i.e., interest and capital cost allowance).\n[51] Subparagraphs 8(1)(h)(i) and (ii) and subparagraphs 8(1)(h.1)(i) and (ii) state the following requirements for paragraphs 8(1)(h) and (h.1), respectively, to apply:\nwhere the taxpayer, in the year,\n(i) was ordinarily required to carry on the duties of the office or employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business or in different places, and\n(ii) was required under the contract of employment to pay the [8(1)(h): travel expenses] [8(1)(h.1): motor vehicle expenses] incurred by the taxpayer in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, \u2026\n[52] The Appellant clearly met these conditions. Under the terms of his employment by each of the Employers the Appellant was ordinarily required to travel throughout the GTA to see patients, to have a motor vehicle and to incur travel and motor vehicle expenses. While it is possible that the Appellant occasionally met patients at an Employer\u2019s place of business (e.g., a retirement home or nursing home operated by the Employer),[15] the Appellant was also required to meet patients in their homes in the ordinary course of his employment duties.\n[53] Under subparagraph 8(1)(h)(iii), paragraph 8(1)(h) does not apply to travel expenses if the Appellant received an allowance for the travel expenses that was not included in his income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(v), (vi) or (vii). The evidence indicates that the Appellant did not receive an allowance for travel expenses from any of the Employers. Consequently, the Appellant\u2019s reasonable travel expenses incurred by him in the performance of the duties of his employment by each of the Employers were deductible. I will address the quantum of such expenses at the conclusion of these reasons for judgment.\n[54] Under subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii), paragraph 8(1)(h.1) does not apply to motor vehicle expenses incurred by the Appellant if the Appellant received an allowance for the motor vehicle expenses that was not included in income because of paragraph 6(1)(b).\n[55] Subject to a parenthetical exception that does not apply to the Appellant, subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) excludes from the income of an employee \u201creasonable\u201d allowances received by an employee from the employer for travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment.\n[56] In Nicoll v. R., 2023 TCC 116, the Tax Court judge reproduced subparagraphs 6(1)(b)(vii) and (vii.1) and then observed:\n11 The above wording has been in effect since 1994 and applies to the 1990 taxation year and later. The retroactive amendment in 1994 specifically deleted the previous wording of \u201callowances (not in excess of reasonable amounts)\u201d from both subparagraphs 6(1)(b)(vii) and (vii.1) and replaced it with \u201creasonable allowances\u201d.\n12 In explanation of the amendment, the May 30, 1991 Department of Finance Technical Notes say:\nThese paragraphs are amended, applicable to the 1990 and subsequent taxation years, to provide that reasonable allowances in respect of travelling expenses and motor vehicle expenses will be excluded in computing the income of an individual from an office or employment. Thus allowances that are not reasonable, rather than only those in excess of a reasonable allowance, may be included in income. In these circumstances, the taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction with respect to travelling expenses under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (h).\n[Footnotes omitted.]\n[57] The question of whether an allowance is reasonable or is not reasonable is a question of fact.[16] The word \u201creasonable\u201d in the sense employed in subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) connotes that an amount must be within limits of what it would be rationale or sensible to expect in the circumstances.\n[58] In Mohammad v. Canada, [1998] 1 F.C. 165 (FC-AD), the Court observed:\n[28] When evaluating the reasonableness of an expense, one is measuring its reasonableness in terms of its magnitude or quantum. Although such a determination may involve an element of subjective appreciation on the part of the trier of fact, there should always be a search for an objective component. \u2026\n[59] Neither the Respondent nor the Appellant argued that the motor vehicle allowances provided to the Appellant by ParaMed and Spectrum were not reasonable and in the absence of evidence demonstrating manifest unreasonableness I see no reason to address that question of fact.\n[60] In addition to the factual question of reasonableness, subparagraph 6(1)(b)(x) deems an allowance not to be reasonable where the measurement of the use of the motor vehicle used to calculate the allowance is not based solely on the number of kilometers driven for the relevant employment, and subparagraph 6(1)(b)(xi) deems an allowance not to be reasonable where the taxpayer receives both an allowance in respect of the use of a motor vehicle and is reimbursed in whole or in part for expenses in respect of that use.\n[61] With the exception of the fixed allowance of $5.30 in 2018, the motor vehicle allowance provided by ParaMed for each of the Taxation Years was not included in the Appellant\u2019s income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1). Accordingly, the Appellant was not entitled to a deduction of motor vehicle expenses incurred in respect of his employment by ParaMed for any of the Taxation Years.\n[62] The fact that the CRA may have considered a greater per kilometer allowance than that provided by ParaMed reasonable does not entitle the Appellant to deduct the difference under paragraph 8(1)(h.1) when the allowance was not included in income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) and there is no evidence that the allowance was not reasonable.[17]\n[63] According to the T2200 forms issued to the Appellant by Spectrum, the motor vehicle allowance provided to the Appellant by Spectrum was not based solely on the number of kilometers driven by the Appellant in connection with his employment by Spectrum. Consequently, the motor vehicle allowance was not excluded from the Appellant\u2019s income by subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) because it was deemed not to be reasonable by subparagraph 6(1)(b)(x).\n[64] However, section 5 of the T2200 forms issued by Spectrum to the Appellant for the Taxation Years indicates that Spectrum did not include the motor vehicle allowance on the T4s it issued to the Appellant for the Taxation Years. Also, the Appellant did not report this allowance as income, the CRA did not challenge the Appellant\u2019s filing position and based on the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the Respondent appears to have assumed that the allowance was not taxable.\n[65] Paragraph 8(1)(h.1) states that a taxpayer that meets the conditions recited in subparagraphs 8(1)(h.1)(i) and (ii) is entitled to deduct motor vehicle expenses incurred for travelling in the course of employment:\n\u2026 except where the taxpayer\n(iii) received an allowance for motor vehicle expenses that was, because of paragraph 6(1)(b), not included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[66] In this case, the motor vehicle allowance provided by Spectrum to the Appellant for each of the Taxation Years was not included in computing his income because Spectrum failed to include the allowance on the T4s issued to the Appellant for the Taxation Years and the Appellant did not otherwise report the amount as income.\n[67] Because based on the evidence[18] subparagraph 6(1)(x) clearly did apply to the allowance provided by Spectrum, paragraph 6(1)(b) did not apply to exclude the allowance from the Appellant\u2019s income. Consequently, the limitation in subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii) did not apply to the motor vehicle expenses incurred by the Appellant in respect of his employment by Spectrum.\n[68] Although this is a peculiar result, it is nevertheless clearly the result mandated by the words of subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii) when read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense.\n[69] The result is not inconsistent with the purpose of the exclusion in subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii), which is to disallow a deduction for a motor vehicle expense if the taxpayer has received an allowance that is not included in the income of the taxpayer because of paragraph 6(1)(b). This purpose is not thwarted if the allowance is not included in income for some other reason.\n[70] In order to be entitled to a deduction under paragraph 8(1)(j), the Appellant must be entitled to a deduction under paragraph 8(1)(f), (h) or (h.1). I have found that the Appellant was entitled to deduct the travel expenses that he incurred in respect of his employment by each of the Employers. I have also found that the Appellant was entitled to deduct the motor vehicle expenses that he incurred in respect of his employment by S.R.T. Med-Staff and Spectrum. Consequently, the Appellant is entitled to deduct the amounts identified in paragraph 8(1)(j) for the motor vehicle used by the Appellant in the performance of his employment duties for the Employers.\n[71] The foregoing analysis of the law does not address the quantum of the expenses allowed to the Appellant under paragraphs 8(1)(h), (h.1) or (j). The quantum of the expenses that may be deducted by the Appellant is impacted not only by the actual amount of the expenses incurred by the Appellant but also by issues such as whether any of the Appellant\u2019s travel was between his home and a place of work.[19] Evidence such as receipts, travel logs and motor vehicle logs would allow the Court to address such issues.\n[72] Unfortunately, apart from the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he maintained records and logs that he provided to the CRA, and that he incurred the expenses indicated on the T777 comparative summary entered as Exhibit A-17, the Appellant provided no evidence supporting the quantum of the expenses incurred by him that qualify for deduction under paragraph 8(1)(h), (h.1) or (j). I raised this issue with counsel for the Appellant during argument and counsel conceded that there was no evidence on the record regarding the quantum of the expenditures incurred by the Appellant.[20]\n[73] The Appellant\u2019s evidence regarding the type of records he maintained and the quantum of expenses that he claimed is not the sort of evidence that challenges the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact regarding the quantum of the employment expenses he incurred during each of the Taxation Years. Consequently, I have no choice but to accept the Minister\u2019s assumptions as to the quantum of those expenses. As recently stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dirani:\n[5] In denying the appellant\u2019s claims, the Minister relied on the following assumptions: the company\u2019s assets exceeded its liabilities upon its dissolution, the appellant did not make an investment in the company, and the company did not owe any uncollectible debt to the appellant.\n[6] The Tax Court determined that the appellant had failed to demolish these assumptions. The Tax Court judge carefully reviewed the evidence before it (Oral Reasons at pages 3-5), and found that the appellant had not submitted any evidence upon which it could conclude that he had either advanced money to the company or incurred any bad debt (Oral Reasons at pages 10-11).\n\u2026\n[12] The expiry of the time periods prescribed in subsection 230(4) of the Act and section 5800 of the Regulations do not shield or immunize taxpayers from the evidentiary burdens they face in Tax Court proceedings. To hold otherwise would undermine the integrity of our self-assessing tax system. Maintaining books and records is an ongoing obligation in a self-assessing system and the appellant\u2019s failure to do so also made it impossible for him to meet the evidentiary burden on him to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions.\n[74] The failure of the Appellant to present evidence challenging the assumptions of fact made by the Minister regarding the quantum of the Appellant\u2019s travel and motor vehicle expenses leads inexorably to the conclusion that the Appellant has failed to satisfy the burden of proof placed on the Appellant to establish to a balance of probabilities the facts that show the Reassessments to be wrong.\n[75] For the foregoing reasons, the appeals by the Appellant of the Reassessments are dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 14th day of March 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

For the first 9 years that it owned the condominium unit, the Appellant rented it to third parties under long-term leases. However, for most of the last 14 months that it owned the condominium unit, the Appellant leased the property under a number of short-term leases through the Airbnb platform. The question before the Court is whether, in such a situation, the sale of the condominium unit was subject to GST\/HST.\n[2] The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts (the \u201cASF\u201d) and a joint book of documents. The parties agreed that the documents included in the joint book of documents were authentic true copies of the original documents and agreed on the truth of the contents of the documents. On the basis of this agreement, I entered the book of documents as Exhibit AR-1.[1]\n[3] Neither party called a witness during the hearing.\nSummary of Facts\n[4] The Appellant is registered for GST purposes under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, C. E-15 (the \u201cGST Act\u201d). It is an annual filer, with a reporting period ending on May 31 of each year. It is owned equally by brothers David and Dean Ross, who are the only shareholders and directors of the Appellant.\n[5] On February 29, 2008, the Appellant purchased a used condominium unit located at 2204-179 George Street, Ottawa (the \u201cCondominium\u201d).\n[6] Between February 2008 and February 2017, the Appellant leased the Condominium to persons who signed a contiguous series of long-term leases. Each lease exceeded 60 days. The last lease expired in February 2017.\n[7] Beginning on February 25, 2017 and ending in April of 2018, the Appellant listed the Condominium on the Airbnb platform and rented out the property through a series of short-term leases. The Appellant realized gross revenue from the short-term leases of $11,200 in 2017 and $43,179 in 2018.\n[8] The Appellant\u2019s final Airbnb reservation was for a stay of 31 nights ending February 26, 2018.\n[9] On December 12, 2017, the Appellant listed the Condominium for sale. On January 24, 2018, the Appellant entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with MLJFS Holdings, an arm\u2019s-length purchaser, for the Condominium. The sale closed on April 11, 2018.\n[10] Neither the Appellant nor the purchaser remitted GST in respect of the sale of the Condominium.\n[11] When assessing the Appellant for its annual GST reporting period between June 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018, the Minister assessed the Appellant $77,079.64 as GST\/HST collectable on the sale of the Condominium.\nThe Relevant Law and the Issues to be Decided by the Court\n[12] The question before the Court is whether the sale of the Condominium was subject to GST under Division II of the GST Act. Section 165 levies the Division II tax.\n[13] Subsection 165(1) imposes Division II tax at the rate of 5% on the recipient of a taxable supply that is made in Canada. Subsection 165(2) provides that if the taxable supply is made in a participating province, the rate of tax is increased by the tax rate for that province. The tax levied under each of subsections 165(1) and 165(2) is levied on the value of the consideration for the supply.\n[14] The Condominium is situated in Ontario; therefore, under subsection 142(1) and section 144.1, the sale of the Condominium was made in Canada and was made in a participating province, namely Ontario. As a result, if the sale was a taxable supply, then it was subject to tax at the 13% HST rate applicable to supplies made in Ontario.\n[15] The sale of the Condominium was clearly a supply, since supply is defined in subsection 123(1) as the provision of property or a service in any manner, including sale.\n[16] The issue before the Court is whether the sale was a taxable supply. Taxable supply is defined in subsection 123(1) as a supply made in the course of a commercial activity. Commercial activity is defined in subsection 123(1). Paragraph (c) of the definition states that a commercial activity means \u201cthe making of a supply (other than an exempt supply) by the person of real property of the person, including anything done by the person in the course of or in connection with the making of the supply\u201d.\n[17] The Appellant\u2019s sale of the Condominium was a supply of real property of the Appellant. Therefore, it was made in the course of a commercial activity unless the sale of the Condominium was an exempt supply.\n[18] Exempt supplies for purposes of the GST Act are set out in Schedule V of the Act. Part I of Schedule V exempts various supplies of real property. The relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is section 2 of Part I of Schedule V.\n[19] The relevant portion of the section reads as follows:\n2. A particular supply by way of sale of a residential complex or an interest in a residential complex made by a particular person who is not a builder of the complex or, if the complex is a multiple unit residential complex, an addition to the complex, unless\n(a) the particular person claimed an input tax credit in respect of the last acquisition by the person of the complex or in respect of an improvement to the complex acquired, imported or brought into a participating province by the person after the complex was last acquired by the person; or \u2026[2]\n[20] This section will apply to the sale of the Condominium if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the sale of the Condominium was the sale of a residential complex;\n-the Appellant was not a builder of the Condominium; and\n-the Appellant did not claim an input tax credit in respect of the last acquisition by the Appellant of the Condominium or in respect of an improvement to the Condominium.\n[21] The term builder of a residential complex is defined in subsection 123(1). The parties have agreed that the Appellant is not a builder for purposes of this definition. There are no facts before the Court that would suggest that the Appellant was a builder of the Condominium for purposes of the definition.\n[22] Paragraph 21 of the ASF states that the Appellant claimed input tax credits in respect of the tax paid on the purchase of furniture in December of 2016 and on the purchase of the service of painting in January 2017. The ASF states at paragraph 22 that the Appellant did not claim any input tax credits with respect to the purchase of or improvement to the Property.\n[23] These paragraphs are inconsistent if, as a question of fact, the painting that occurred in January of 2017 constituted an improvement to the Condominium within the meaning of the definition of improvement in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act. I do not have any facts before me that would allow me to determine whether the painting constitutes an improvement. However, during the hearing, the Respondent and the Appellant conceded that whatever painting occurred at the Condominium, it did not constitute an improvement for purposes of the GST Act.\n[24] In addition, it is not clear to me how the Appellant could claim input tax credits in respect of property and services that it acquired for consumption or use in the course of supplying the Condominium under a long-term residential lease. As I will discuss, such a supply constitutes an exempt supply.\n[25] In summary, there are no facts before me that would lead me to question the concession made by the parties that the Appellant did not claim any input tax credits with respect to the purchase of or improvements to the Condominium.\n[26] The only issue before the Court is the remaining condition that must be satisfied before the sale of the Condominium will be considered an exempt supply: the sale of the Condominium must constitute the sale of a residential complex.\n[27] Residential complex is defined in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act. The relevant portions of that definition for the purpose of this appeal, are as follows:\n\u201cresidential complex\u201d means\n(a) that part of a building in which one or more residential units are located, together with\n(i) that part of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land immediately contiguous to the building that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building as a place of residence for individuals, and\n(ii) that proportion of the land subjacent to the building that that part of the building is of the whole building,\n(b) that part of a building that is\n(i) the whole or part of a semi-detached house, rowhouse unit, residential condominium unit or other similar premises that is, or is intended to be, a separate parcel or other division of real property owned, or intended to be owned, apart from any other unit in the building, and\n(ii) a residential unit,\ntogether with that proportion of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land subjacent or immediately contiguous to the building that is attributable to the unit and that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence for individuals,\n(c) the whole of a building described in paragraph (a), or the whole of a premises described in subparagraph (b)(i), that is owned by or has been supplied by way of sale to an individual and that is used primarily as a place of residence of the individual, an individual related to the individual or a former spouse or common\u2011law partner of the individual, together with\n(i) in the case of a building described in paragraph (a), any appurtenances to the building, the land subjacent to the building and that part of the land immediately contiguous to the building, that are reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building, and\n(ii) in the case of a premises described in subparagraph (b)(i), that part of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land subjacent or immediately contiguous to the building that is attributable to the unit and that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the unit,\n\u2026\nbut does not include a building, or that part of a building, that is a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house or other similar premises, or the land and appurtenances attributable to the building or part, where the building is not described in paragraph (c) and all or substantially all of the leases, licences or similar arrangements, under which residential units in the building or part are supplied, provide, or are expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than sixty days;\n[28] Under this definition, the Condominium will be a residential complex if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the Condominium is either a residential unit or a residential condominium unit; and\n-the exclusion at the end of the definition does not apply to the Condominium.\n[29] The Condominium is a residential unit. Residential unit is defined, in part, in subsection 123(1) to mean a condominium unit.\n[30] The Condominium is also a residential condominium unit under the definition in subsection 123(1) provided that it is a residential complex.\n[31] The Condominium will constitute a residential complex provided that the general exclusion in the definition of residential complex does not apply to the Condominium. This exclusion will apply to the Condominium if:\n-the Condominium is that part of a building that is a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house or other similar premises;\n-the building in which the Condominium is located is not described in paragraph (c) of the definition; and\n-all or substantially all of the leases, licences or similar arrangements, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[32] The building in which the Condominium is located is not described in paragraph (c) of the definition. That paragraph only applies to a building or condominium owned by an individual.\n[33] The Appellant argues that the exclusion does not apply to the Condominium for two reasons. First, the Condominium is not a hotel, motel or other similar premises. Second, if the Condominium is a hotel, motel or other similar premises, then the all or substantially all test contained in the exclusion does not apply to the supplies of the Condominium.\n[34] A provision that is relevant when determining whether the exclusion in the definition of residential complex applies to the Condominium is the change-in-use rule for real property contained in subsection 206(2).\n[35] Subsection 206(2) apples when a registrant did not acquire real property for use as capital property in its GST commercial activities and then begins, at a particular time, to use the property as capital property in its commercial activities.[3] The subsection reads as follows:\n(2) Beginning use in commercial activities For the purposes of this Part, where a registrant last acquired real property for use as capital property of the registrant but not for use in commercial activities of the registrant and the registrant begins, at a particular time, to use the property as capital property in commercial activities of the registrant, except where the registrant becomes a registrant at the particular time, the registrant shall be deemed\n(a) to have received, at the particular time, a supply of the property by way of sale; and\n(b) except where the supply is an exempt supply, to have paid, at the particular time, tax in respect of the supply equal to the basic tax content of the property at the particular time.\n[36] This subsection will apply in respect of the Condominium if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the Appellant last acquired the Condominium for use as capital property in GST non-commercial activities;\n-the Appellant began, at a particular time, to use the Condominium as capital property in its commercial activities; and\n-the Appellant did not become a registrant at the particular time.\n[37] If the subsection applies, then the registrant is deemed, at the time that it began to use the Condominium in commercial activities, to have received a supply of the Condominium by way of sale and, except where the supply is an exempt supply, to have paid GST equal to the basic tax content of the property.\n[38] Generally speaking, the basic tax content is the tax paid by the registrant on the acquisition of the property and on any improvements to the property, provided that such tax was not recovered by way of rebate, refund or remission.\n[39] The ASF states that the Appellant was a GST registrant at the time that it acquired the property and retained that status throughout the relevant period.\n[40] The Appellant acquired the Condominium on February 29, 2008 for use as capital property. Capital property is defined in subsection 123(1) as property that is capital property under the Income Tax Act. The Condominium would clearly be capital property under that Act.\n[41] The evidence before me is that on February 29, 2008, the Appellant acquired the Condominium for use in non-GST commercial activities. In particular, the Appellant acquired the Condominium to make exempt supplies that were long-term residential leases.\n[42] Section 6 of Part I of Schedule V of the GST Act exempts the supply of a residential unit, such as the Condominium, by way of lease, licence or similar arrangement for the purpose of its occupancy as a place of residence or lodging by an individual, where the period throughout which continuous occupancy of the complex or unit is given to the same individual under the arrangement is at least one month.\n[43] Paragraph 8 of the ASF states that each of the Appellant\u2019s leases of the Condominium between February 2008 and February 2017 were to persons who each signed a contiguous series of long-term residential leases, with each lease exceeding 60 days. As a result, each of these supplies was an exempt supply. Therefore, the Appellant did not acquire the Condominium on February 29, 2008 for use in commercial activities.\n[44] On February 25, 2017, the Appellant listed the Condominium on the Airbnb platform for lease as a short-term lease. Tab 6 of Exhibit AR-1 shows that between March of 2017 and April of 2018, the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of lease on numerous occasions for periods of less than one month. Most of the supplies were for fewer than seven nights, with many for only one night. Such supplies were not exempt supplies since they were for periods of less than one month. The short-term leases were taxable supplies of real property.\n[45] As noted previously, a commercial activity includes the making of any supply of real property, other than an exempt supply. Paragraph 141.1(3)(a) provides that to the extent that a person does anything (other than make a supply) in connection with the establishment of a commercial activity of the person, the person is deemed to have done that thing in the course of commercial activities of the person.\n[46] It appears from the ASF that the first step that the Appellant took to establish the commercial activity of leasing the Condominium on short-term leases was the listing of the Condominium on the Airbnb website on February 25, 2017. Under paragraph 141.1(3)(a), the Appellant was deemed to have listed the Condominium in the course of its commercial activities. By offering the Condominium for short\u2011term lease on February 25, 2017, the Appellant began to use the Condominium in the course of its commercial activities on that date. Since the Appellant made such supplies in the course of its commercial activities, they constituted taxable supplies.\n[47] As a result, unless subsection 206(2) is subject to another section, the change\u2011in-use rules in subsection 206(2) applied to the Appellant on February 25, 2017, the particular time that the Appellant began to use the Condominium in commercial activities.\n[48] Therefore, assuming that subsection 206(2) applies, the Appellant was deemed under paragraph 206(2)(a) to have received a supply of the Condominium on February 25, 2017 by way of sale.\n[49] Paragraph 206(2)(b), which deems tax to be paid equal to the basic tax content, has no application. Paragraph 4 of the ASF states that the Condominium was a used condominium at the time that it was purchased by the Appellant. I assume this means that the Appellant did not pay GST when it acquired the Condominium. This was confirmed during the hearing by counsel for the Appellant. In such a situation, the basic tax content of the Condominium was zero on February 25, 2017.\n[50] The Appellant argues that subsection 206(2) does not apply because of the application of section 197. Section 197 limits the application of the change-in-use rules in subsections 206(2), (3), and (5), subsection 207(2), and subsections 208(2) and (3) to situations where the change in use is 10% or more.\n[51] Section 197 reads as follows:\nInsignificant changes in use \u2014 For the purposes of subsections 206(2), (3) and (5), 207(2) and 208(2) and (3), where in any period\n(a) beginning on the later of\n(i) the day a registrant last acquired or imported property for use as capital property of the registrant, and\n(ii) the day subsection 206(3) or (5), 207(2) or 208(3) last applied to the property, and\n(b) ending at any time after that day,\nthe extent to which the registrant changed the use of the property in commercial activities of the registrant is less than 10% of the total use of the property, the registrant shall be deemed to have used the property throughout that period to the same extent and in the same way as the registrant used the property at the beginning of that period, unless the registrant is an individual who began in that period to use the property primarily for the personal use and enjoyment of the individual or a related individual.\n[52] One of the situations where section 197 will apply to a change in use of real property is the situation where, between the time that a registrant last acquired the real property and a specific point in time, the extent to which the registrant changed the use of the real property is less than 10%. If the section applies in this situation then, for purposes of subsection 206(2) (and the other specified change-in-use rule for real property), the change in use is ignored. If the registrant is a corporation, it is deemed to have used the real property throughout the period to the same extent and in the same way as the registrant used the property at the time that it acquired the real property.\n[53] The Appellant argued that section 197 applies to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017.\nDisposition of Appeal\n[54] The issues before the Court are the application of the real property change\u2011in\u2011use rules, specifically subsection 206(2) and section 197, and the application of the definition of residential complex contained in subsection 123(1).\n[55] There is no dispute with respect to the relevant facts. The issues are purely matters of statutory interpretation.\n[56] In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, [4] the Supreme Court of Canada identified the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive\u201d principle as the principle that is to be used when interpreting the Act. At paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Court explained the principle as follows:\n[10] \u2026 The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play[s] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\nChange-in-Use Rules\n[57] I will first address the application of the real property change-in-use rules to the Condominium.\n[58] The Appellant argued that when applying section 197, one looks to the period beginning on the date that the Appellant acquired the Condominium (February 29, 2008) and ending on the date that the Condominium was sold (April 11, 2018). The Appellant noted that during these 3,694 days of ownership, the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of taxable short-term leases for 366 days. On this basis, during the time that the Appellant owned the Condominium, it was used 9.9% of the time in commercial activities. As a result, section 197 applied, and the change-in-use rule in subsection 206(2) did not apply to the Condominium during the period that it was owned by the Appellant.\n[59] Section 206 contains rules whose primary purpose is to cause an increase or decrease in input tax credits when there is a change in use of capital real property. The section applies to registrants who are not individuals and to public sector bodies that file a section 211 election. The section applies to the Appellant, a corporation.\n[60] In most instances, subsection 206(2) applies to a GST registrant who, at the time that it acquired the real property, intended to use the real property exclusively in the making of exempt supplies. In such a situation, the registrant is not entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST that it paid on the acquisition of the real property, since it did not acquire the real property for use in its commercial activities. However, if the registrant begins to use the real property in its commercial activities, then subsection 206(2) allows the registrant to claim, at the time that it begins to use the real property in its commercial activities, an input tax credit. The input tax credit is based on the GST that the registrant paid on the acquisition of the real property, and the extent to which it is now using the real property in its commercial activities.\n[61] This is accomplished by deeming the registrant, for purposes of the GST Act, to have repurchased the property at the time of the change in use and to have paid tax at that time equal to the tax that it paid on the acquisition of the real property that was not previously recovered by way of rebate, refund or remission (the basic tax content of the property).\n[62] The remaining subsections of section 206 provide similar rules for situations where a registrant that is using real property in its commercial activities increases or decreases the extent to which it is using the real property in its commercial activities, or the registrant ceases to use real property in its commercial activities.\n[63] It is clear from the wording of the section 206 change-in-use rules, that the change-in-use rules apply at the point in time that a change in use occurs. It is at the time of each change in use that a supply is deemed to occur and that the amount of any additional input tax credit or the amount that the registrant is required to pay in respect of a previous claimed input tax credit is determined.\n[64] This can be seen from the wording of section 206. Subsection 206(2) applies to a registrant who begins, at a particular time, to use the real property as capital property in its commercial activities. Subsection 206(3), which deals with increases in use in commercial activities, applies where the registrant increases, at a particular time, the use of the real property in commercial activities. Subsection 206(4), which deals with ceasing to use the real property in commercial activities, applies where a registrant begins, at a particular time, to use the real property exclusively for non-commercial purposes. Subsection 206(5), which deals with reduction in the use of real property in commercial activities, applies where the registrant reduces, at a particular time, the use of the real property in commercial activities.\n[65] In summary, the change-in-use rules look to a change in use that occurs at a specific point in time and, on the basis of the extent of the change in use that occurs at that point in time, deem a supply to have been made or received. It is the extent and nature of the change in use that occurs at a particular point in time that determine which of the various subsections of section 206 apply.\n[66] Section 206 applies each time a change in use occurs. For example, if on day 1 a registrant acquires real property for use exclusively in exempt activities and then, on day 10, changes the use of the real property to 30% usage in commercial activities, subsection 206(2) applies on the date of the change in use. If on day 20, the registrant increases the use in commercial activities to 50%, then subsection 206(3) will apply on day 20. If on day 50, the use of the real property in commercial activities is reduced to 15%, subsection 206(5) will apply to the registrant on day 50.\n[67] Section 197 works with section 206 to limit the application of section 206 to individual changes in use that cumulatively are at least 10%. This saves the registrant the administrative costs of having to account for insignificant changes in use.\n[68] When determining whether, for the purposes of subsections 206(2), (3) and (5), a change in use of 10% or more has occurred at a particular point in time, section 197 looks at the changes in use that occurred during the period beginning on the later of the day the registrant last acquired the real property and the day subsection 206(3) or (5) applied and ending at any time after that date.\n[69] If, as is the case in this appeal, subsections 206(3) and (5) have never applied, the relevant period begins on the day that the registrant last acquired the real property and ends at any time after this date.\n[70] Section 197 refers to all the changes in use that occurred during this period. It accumulates the changes in use until such time as the total of the changes in use that have occurred since the time the real property was acquired is 10% or higher. This means that section 197 will only apply if the cumulative change in use of the real property beginning on the day the registrant last acquired the real property is less than 10%. Section 197 ceases to apply on the day that the cumulative change in use is 10% or higher. At this point in time, section 206 will apply to the change in use.\n[71] In the current appeal, the issue is whether section 197 applied to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017, when the Appellant began to use the Condominium 100% in commercial activities.\n[72] Clearly, section 197 did not apply. During the period beginning on the day that the Appellant acquired the Condominium (February 29, 2008) and ending on the date of the change in use (February 25, 2017), the cumulative change in use was 100%.\n[73] The Appellant asks the Court to only consider a period beginning on the day that the Appellant acquired the Condominium and ending on the day that it sold the property. This position ignores the very specific wording of section 197. Further, such an interpretation would defeat the purpose of section 206 by ignoring all changes in use that occurred while a registrant owned real property.\n[74] Since section 197 did not apply to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017, then, as discussed previously, the change\u2011in\u2011use rules in subsection 206(2) applied to the Condominium on February 25, 2017, the particular time that the Appellant began to use the Condominium 100% in commercial activities. As a result, the Appellant was deemed under paragraph 206(2)(a) to have received a supply of the Condominium on February 25, 2017 by way of sale.\nApplication of Exempting Provision\n[75] The primary issue before the Court is whether the sale of the Condominium on April 11, 2018 was a taxable supply or an exempt supply. The answer to this question will depend on whether the Condominium was, at the time of the sale, a residential complex.\n[76] As noted previously, since the Condominium was a residential unit at the time of sale, it was also a residential complex, unless the general exclusion in the definition of residential complex applied to the Condominium.\n[77] The Respondent argued that the exclusion applied to the Condominium at the time of sale. The Appellant argued that the exclusion did not apply since the Condominium was not part of premises that were similar to a hotel or motel and the all or substantially all test included in the definition was not satisfied.\n[78] I will first address the Appellant\u2019s argument that the Condominium was not similar premises to a hotel or motel.\n[79] The Respondent correctly noted that when determining whether the exclusion applies, one must consider all of the words in the definition of residential complex. The exclusion refers to premises that are a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house and other similar premises.\n[80] The question before the Court is whether the Condominium, at the time that it was sold, was similar premises to a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house and a lodging house. The answer to that question is yes.\n[81] At the time of sale, the Appellant was offering the Condominium for short\u2011term lease on the Airbnb platform and was in fact leasing it for periods as short as one night. The Condominium was leased on a furnished basis with the Appellant paying all heating, air conditioning and electricity costs. Since the Court was not provided with the Airbnb listing, it is not clear what other amenities were provided to the lessee. However, the evidence before me was that the Appellant did provide Wi-Fi access as part of the short-term lease.\n[82] In my view, a Condominium being leased in such a manner is similar premises to a hotel, motel, an inn, a boarding house, or a lodging house.\n[83] Collectively, hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses and lodging houses are premises that are regularly supplied as accommodations to third parties on a short\u2011term basis for a fee.\n[84] The short-term accommodations provided in a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house and lodging house are normally furnished accommodations. Rooms and suites in a hotel, motel or inn are supplied with heat, electricity and, in many instances, air conditioning.\n[85] The definition refers to a wide range of accommodations. A hotel or a motel may be a single room or a suite. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary defines a lodging house as being equal to a rooming house and defines a rooming house as a house or building divided into furnished rooms or apartments. When one considers all of the types of physical accommodations provided in a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house or lodging house, it is clear that similar premises include a furnished condominium that is leased on a short-term (or even long-term) basis.\n[86] The Appellant argued that the Condominium was not similar to a hotel or a motel since it did not have a restaurant or otherwise provide food to the lessee. This argument assumes that all hotels and motels have restaurants. I have no evidence before me to support such a conclusion. Further, the fee charged by most hotels or motels for a room or a suite only covers the cost of the room or suite; it is not a fee for food. It is the guest\u2019s decision whether they want to purchase food from the hotel\/motel.[5]\n[87] Having found that the Condominium was similar premises to a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house and lodging house, I must now address the all or substantially all test that is set out in the exclusion. Specifically, I must determine whether, at the point in time that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[88] The Appellant argues that the all or substantially all test does not refer to a specific period when the test should be applied. Counsel for the Appellant argued that there is no \u201ctimestamp\u201d that says that the all or substantially all test applies to leases in a specific period such as a reporting period, the last year of ownership or the last month of ownership. The Appellant argues that the test should be applied over the entire ownership period.\n[89] The Appellant argues that the test is not met since, between February 29, 2008 (the date the Appellant acquired the Condominium) and April 11, 2018 (the date the Appellant sold the Condominium), all or substantially all of the leases of the Condominium provided for periods of continuous possession of at least 60 days. This is because the Condominium was leased 100% on a long\u2011term basis between February 29, 2008 and February 25, 2017.\n[90] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s argument. The definition of residential complex contains no time stamp because the definition does not require a time stamp. The determination is not made over a period of time. The determination of whether the all or substantially all test applies is made based on the use of the Condominium at the time that the Condominium was sold.\n[91] When determining, under the GST Act, whether a taxable or exempt supply has been made, it is important to recognize that the tax levied under the GST Act is a value\u2011added tax that is levied on individual supplies. The application of the tax must be determined for each individual supply. This determination is made at the time that the supply is made. Specifically, it is at the time that the supply is made that one determines the recipient of the supply, whether the specific supply is a taxable supply or an exempt supply, whether the supply is made in Canada, whether the supply is made in a participating province, and the consideration for the supply.\n[92] As a result, the Court must determine whether, at the time of the sale of the Condominium, the Appellant made an exempt supply or a taxable supply.\n[93] This determination is dependent on the exempting provision in section 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the GST Act. The application of this provision is dependent on whether, at the moment that the Appellant sold the Condominium, namely, on April 11, 2018, the Condominium was a residential complex as that term is defined in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act.\n[94] This requires the Court to determine whether, at the time that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases under which the Condominium was being supplied at that point in time provided or were expected to provide for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[95] The answer is clearly yes. At the time of sale, the Condominium was only being leased under short-term leases. All such leases were for less than 60 days; most were for only a few days. Therefore, on the day that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[96] At the time that the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of sale, the Condominium was not a residential complex since it was similar premises to a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house or lodging house and, at the time of sale, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[97] Even if I were to accept the Appellant\u2019s argument, it would lead to the same result.\n[98] The Appellant was deemed under subsection 206(2) to have acquired the Condominium on February 25, 2017. Therefore, between the last time that the Appellant, for purposes of the GST Act, acquired the Condominium (February 25, 2017) and the date that it sold the property (April 11, 2018), the Appellant only used the property to make short-term taxable supplies by way of leases for periods of less than 60 days. At no point in time during this period was the Condominium a residential complex as defined in subsection 123(1) since all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied during this period, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[99] Since the Condominium was not, at the time that it was supplied by way of sale, a residential complex, the supply by way of sale was not an exempt supply under section 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the GST Act. It was a taxable supply of real property.\n[100] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 15th day of March 2024.\n\u201cS.

Overview\n[1] This matter involves a motion made by the Appellant for costs in this appeal to be determined as a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs pursuant to section 147 of the Rules of the Tax Court of Canada (General Procedure).\n[2] The appeal from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d) for the Appellant\u2019s 2000 and 2001 taxation years was dismissed with costs in favour of the Respondent on March 19, 2021 (2021 TCC 23). The trial judge retired in December 2022.\n[3] On April 13, 2023, the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d) set aside the decision of this Court with costs in favour of the Appellant (2023 FCA 78) (the \u201cFCA decision\u201d). The matter is thus once again before this Court but solely for the determination of costs based on written representations.\n[4] By way of background, the Appellant had implemented a structure (known as a \u201ctower structure\u201d) to acquire a US corporation and the funding for that acquisition involved a series of steps including a loan from the Appellant to a US affiliate.\n[5] The Appellant received and included in income the interest paid on its loan by the US affiliate and \u201cclaimed a deduction under subsection 20(12) of the withholding taxes paid to the US Government on this interest\u201d (para. 7, FCA decision).\n[6] As summarized by the FCA (paras. 9 and 11), the issue was whether the US withholding taxes paid by the Appellant were deductible in computing its income or whether the exception set out in subsection 20(12) was applicable.\n[7] The exception set out in subsection 20(12) of the Act excluded any tax that could \u201creasonably be regarded as having been paid by a corporation in respect of income from a share of the capital stock of a foreign affiliate of the corporation.\u201d\nThe Tax Court had concluded that the exception applied but the FCA determined that it did not and allowed the appeal with costs.\nII. The Law and General Principles\n[8] In General Electric Capital Canada Inc., v. Canada, 2010 TCC 490, Justice Hogan explained that \u201cthe purpose of section 147 of the Rules [is] to give a judge the discretion to move away from the Tariff in order to provide fair and reasonable relief in the circumstances - with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B\u201d (para. 28).\n[9] Justice Hogan referred to Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc., 2002 FCA 417 (para. 10), where Justice Rothstein had indicated that the Court should be satisfied, having regard to the factors set out in subsection 147(3), that there are adequate reasons for departing from Tariff.\n[10] In CIBC World Markets Inc. v. The Queen, 2019 TCC 201, Justice Bocock indicated that he was not inclined to depart from Tariff since it \u201cexists as a default compensatory measure\u201d (paras. 23-24). He awarded costs equal to double the Tariff, given the \u201cnovel nature of the issue owing to the lack of jurisprudence.\u201d\n[11] In the recent decision of Nixon v. The King, 2024 TCC 4, Justice MacPhee noted that \u201csection 147 of the Rules gives the Court broad discretion in awarding costs\u201d and that subsection 147(3) \u201cprovides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to consider in exercising its discretionary power to award costs beyond the Tariff amounts\u201d (para. 5).\n[12] Justice MacPhee then turned to the decision of Hillcore Financial Corporation v. The King, 2023 TCC 144, where Justice Lafleur had provided the following summary of the general principles on costs:\n8. The general rule is that costs should be \u201ccompensatory and contributory\u201d and \u201cnot punitive\u201d (see Grenon v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 89, at para 12). Further, an award of costs is generally not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party (see Velcro Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 273, [Velcro], at para 29).\n9. \u2026\n10. The broad discretion of the Court to award costs should not be exercised in an arbitrary manner but must be exercised on a principled basis; further, the quantum of costs must be reasonable and also determined on a principled basis (The Queen v. Lau, 2004 FCA 10, at para 5; The Queen v. Landry, 2010 FCA 135, at paras 22 and 54; Guibord v. Canada, 2011 FCA 346, at para 10 The King v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133, at para 32).\n11. Subsection 147(3) of the Rules provides a list of factors the Court should consider in exercising its discretion to award costs pursuant to subsection 147(1) of the Rules. However, none of the factors listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules are determinative and as such, the Court should consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion (Velcro, supra , at paras 12-13). As indicated by this Court in Velcro, the Tariff is \u201c... a reference point only should the Court wish to rely upon it\u201d (at para 8).\n12. The relevant parts of the Rules read as follows:\n147 (1) The Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.\n\u2026\n(3) In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,\n(a) the result of the proceeding,\n(b) the amounts in issue,\n(c) the importance of the issues,\n(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,\n(e) the volume of work,\n(f) the complexity of the issues,\n(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,\n(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,\n(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,\n(i)improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii)taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,\n(i.1) whether the expense required to have an expert witness give evidence was justified given\n(i) the nature of the proceeding, its public significance and any need to clarify the law,\n(ii) the number, complexity or technical nature of the issues in dispute, or\n(iii) the amount in dispute; and\n(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n\u2026\n14. This Court is not limited to applying the Tariff. Subsection 147(4) of the Rules provides that the Court \u201c... may fix all or part of the costs with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B and, further, it may award a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs\u201d.\n15. The case law has held that \u201c...increased costs beyond the Tariff are not tied to exceptional circumstances, such as misconduct, malfeasance or undue delay\u201d (see Duffy v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 135 [ Duffy ], at para 21; Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v. The Queen, 2013 TCC 275, at para 4; Ford Motor, supra , at para 7). Indeed, recent case law held that a greater recognition of the work involved in tax litigation should be a factor to consider in awarding costs (see Duffy, supra, at para 21; Blackburn Radio Inc. v. the Queen, 2013 TCC 98, at paras 14-15; Invesco Canada Ltd v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 92, at paras 17 and 25; Spruce Credit Union v. The Queen, 2014 TCC 42, at para 52; Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 15, at\n[13] A proper approach to the determination of costs involves a review of the various applicable factors in section 147(3). If the Court finds there are adequate reasons for departing from Tariff, it must then determine whether costs should be awarded at the lower or upper range established by case law. See Canada v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133 (\u201cBowker\u201d)\n[14] In Zeller Estate v. the Queen, 2009 TCC 135 (\u201cZeller Estate\u201d), Justice D. Campbell had quoted the 2008 edition of Mark Orkin\u2019s The Law of Costs, (2nd Ed.), Vol. 1 (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2008) in support of the proposition that \u201c[t]raditionally the degree of indemnification represented by partial indemnity costs has varied between 50% and 75% of solicitor and client or substantial indemnity costs\u201d (para. 9).\n[15] That assertion was repeated in later decisions including Ford Motor Company Limited v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 185 (para. 7) (\u201cFord Motor\u201d) and Dickie v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 327 (paras. 2 and 27) (\u201cDickie\u201d). The FCA Appeal affirmed Dickie, noting that the trial judge had properly exercised his discretion in awarding costs of 50%, having reviewed the factors set out in subsection 147(3) (2014 FCA 40, para. 6).\n[16] In the more recent decision of Fareed Ahamed TFSA v. The King, 2023 TCC 177, Justice Spiro reviewed a number of decisions going as far back as 2010 (not including Zeller Estate, Ford Motor or Dickie) concluding that the range for an award of costs could be as low as 20% with a mid-range of 35-50%.\n[17] In particular, there was no suggestion that the range should be 50% - 75% of solicitor-client costs. This is not surprising. As noted by the FCA in Bowker, \u201cthere is no consensus in the field as to the breadth of the range, particularly at the upper end\u201d (para. 19).\n[18] It may thus be concluded that an award of costs in the range of 50% - 75% is not the norm in this Court and that such an award should be reserved for exceptional circumstances, taking into consideration the fact that \u201csubstantial indemnity costs\u201d are defined in subsection 147(3.5) of the Rules as \u201c80% of solicitor-client costs.\u201d\n[19] In the end, the determination of costs is always discretionary.\nIII. Position of the Appellant\n[20] The Appellant acknowledges that the trial lasted only one day but claims that the issue was complicated. It is argued that this \u201ccomplexity\u201d was evidenced by the differing analysis and result reached by this Court and the FCA on the correct interpretation of subsection 20(12) of the Act.\n[21] The Appellant submits that a lump sum award of $274,073 (plus applicable taxes) is warranted and appropriate. This would reflect 75% of a counsel fee of $325,431, as more fully described in the bill of costs, plus 100% of a counsel fee of $30,000 for the preparation of the costs submissions in this motion.\n[22] The Appellant states that the range of partial indemnity cost awards in this Court is between 50% and 75% of solicitor-client costs or substantial indemnity costs. The Appellant argues that it should be entitled to 75% of its counsel fee based on its review of the factors set out in subsection 147(3) of the Rules.\nIV. Position of the Respondent\n[23] The Respondent claims that the Appellant\u2019s range of partial-indemnity costs of between 50-75% of solicitor-client costs is an error and that this range is empirically not a \u201cusual\u201d, \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d range for party-party costs.\n[24] The Respondent also adds that it is improper to identify a numerical range for an award of costs and then to calibrate that amount by reviewing the factors set out in subsection 147(3), as indicated by the FCA in Bowker.\n[25] The Respondent argues that that a proper award of costs would be along the lines of CIBC World Markets, supra, because it similarly involved a streamlined litigation process leading to a one-day hearing that addressed a single legal issue. The Court awarded costs equal to Tariff plus $6,000 or approximately double the Tariff for a one-day hearing.\n[26] The Respondent argues that an award of costs at double the Tariff of $4,800 or $9,600 would be an appropriate award of costs in this appeal.\n[27] The Respondent also argues that the Appellant\u2019s claim for 100% of its costs associated with this motion is \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cnot justifiable\u201d. The Respondent argues that each party should assume their own costs, but that if costs are awarded to the Appellant, they should be offset against the costs payable to the Appellant in the underlying appeal. In the alternative, if costs are awarded to the Appellant for the motion, the Respondent requests an opportunity to make additional submissions since the Minister presented an offer to settle costs on September 27, 2023.\nV. Analysis\n[28] The Court now turns to a review of the applicable factors.\n[29] 147(3)(a) - Result of the proceedings: The parties both agree that the Appellant was entirely successful in its appeal. They also agree that where a single issue determines the outcome of a proceeding, this factor stands for the principle that the successful party is entitled to costs but it does not affect the quantum.\n[30] I agree and would view this factor as neutral.\n[31] 147(3)(b) - Amount in Issue: The Appellant sought to restore its claimed deduction of approximately $8.9 million paid in US withholding taxes in 2000 and 2001. It claims that the amounts in issue were significant and justify an increased award.\n[32] The Respondent does not agree indicating that the \u201camount at issue\u201d is to be considered in the context of a particular taxpayer and the transaction to which it relates. In Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd. v. R, 2013 TCC 275, six percent of the proceeds of a major transaction was found to be minimal and costs were limited to Tariff.\n[33] In this instance, the underlying loan from the Appellant to the US affiliate was US $266,670,000 (CA $396,000,000) and the amount at issue represented approximately 2.2% of that amount. For the 2000 taxation year, the Appellant sought to deduct CA $3,808,456, representing approximately 10% of the interest payment of CA $37,876,850 from which it was withheld. A similar percentage applied for 2001.\n[34] Given the amount at issue in the context of the entire transaction, I agree with the Respondent that this factor should be given little weight.\n[35] 147(3)(c) - Importance of the Issue: The Appellant claims that the appeal involved an interpretation and application of subsection 20(12) and that this required counsel to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the entire foreign tax credit and deduction regime. The Respondent admits that the decision may have precedential value for a potentially small class of future litigants using a similar \u201ctower structure\u201d.\n[36] Given the precedential nature of the FCA decision, as admitted by the Respondent, I agree with the parties that this factor would justify an increase from Tariff.\n[37] 147(3)(e) - Volume of Work: The Appellant claims that it voluntarily produced all documents requested by the Respondent as the parties worked towards an agreed statement of facts and made substantial efforts in drafting and pushing forward the necessary factual record in advance of trial. This simplified the procedure, time and issues at trial. The Appellant relies on Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. v. R, 2016 TCC 258 and argues that their efforts should lead to an increased costs award.\n[38] The Respondent acknowledges that this factor is among the most important of the subsection 147(3) factors but argues that the list of documents was brief (under 30 documents), that neither party conducted examinations for discovery, that no witnesses were called including expert witnesses or reports. The trial lasted one day and the appeal turned on the interpretation of a single legislative provision. The Respondent submits that the appeal did not have the hallmarks of a high workload appeal and thus this factor should be neutral.\n[39] The Respondent adds that even if this factor should weigh in favour of the Appellant, the evidence provided is insufficient to determine the nature and extent of the services provided or if the fees were reasonable. More specifically, the Respondent argues that only the services of counsel exceeding 5% of the total time, should be considered and secondly, that time billed for work done prior to the institution of the appeal should be discounted.\n[40] On balance, I agree with the Respondent and find that this factor is neutral.\n[41] 147(3)(f) \u2013 Complexity of the Issues: The Appellant contends that applying subsection 20(12) to the so-called \u201ctower structure\u201d involving a web of hybrid entities was both challenging and complex.\n[42] The Appellant argues that the facts and legal issues applied to those concepts were extremely complicated and that they had to distinguish themselves from FLSmidth Ltd. v. The Queen, 2023 FCA 160 (\u201cFLSmidth\u201d), relied upon by the Crown as being dispositive of the issues raised in this appeal. The trial judge, and later the FCA, agreed with the Appellant, finding that while the structure and transactions implemented by the Appellant were similar, that decision was not dispositive of the appeal. The Appellant submits that this supports an increased award of costs.\n[43] The Respondent argues that the appeal involved only a single issue and that the Appellant is attempting to paint a complicated picture by arguing that the background facts were complex. The Respondent points to the agreed statement of fact and lack of factual complexity that was not the subject of evidence or argument at trial except insofar as they shaped the legal issues in dispute. The Minister believes this issue should be neutral.\n[44] On balance, I find that the complexity of the facts and the issue in the appeal weigh in favour of an increase of costs in favour of the Appellant.\n[45] 147(3)(g) \u2013 Conduct that shortened or lengthened unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding: The Appellant claims that their efforts to resolve the factual matrix through an agreed statement of facts allowed the parties to forego various litigation steps. This shortened the trial and supports an increased award of costs.\n[46] The Respondent agrees that the appeal proceeded on an expeditious basis but argues that they cooperated in the preparation of the partial agreed statement of facts. It argues that the Appellant\u2019s approach would mark a departure from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence and would fundamentally contradict the spirit of the Rules. The Respondent indicates that recent case law has treated subsection 143(3)(g) overwhelmingly as a tool for addressing blameworthy or discreditable behaviour but not as a tool for rewarding a party\u2019s efficiency in the conduct of litigation.\n[47] The Respondent argues that where parties cooperate to streamline the proceedings, costs should be at or near Tariff, as discussed in Appelwood Holdings Inc. v. The Queen, 2019 TCC 34 (para. 12) and Bank of Montreal v. the Queen, 2021 TCC 3 (para. 22).\n[48] The Respondent adds that in any event, there is a lack of detail in the invoices and time entries and no clear indication of the work performed on the agreed statement of facts, such that the Court could not reasonably draw a conclusion even if the request for costs were justifiable.\n[49] I agree with the Respondent that this factor is neutral as both parties took steps to expedite the litigation process leading to a one-day hearing. A high degree of cooperation between the parties should not lead to a higher award of costs for the successful party nor a lower costs award for the unsuccessful party.\n[50] 147(3)(d), (h), (i), (i.1) and (j): The parties agree that these factors are not relevant.\nVI. Conclusion\n[51] In light of the above, the Court is inclined to depart from Tariff based on its finding that the factors described in paragraphs 147(3)(c) and (f) are engaged.\n[52] As acknowledged by the Respondent, the issue addressed by the trial Judge was important. The Appellant successfully distinguished its own facts from those in the leading decision of FLSmidth and the resulting FCA Decision has precedential value albeit for a narrow set of facts involving similar structures.\n[53] Secondly, despite the Respondent\u2019s position that there was only \u201ca single issue\u201d and the matter was not \u201cfactual complexity\u201d given the partial agreed statement of facts, the Court finds that the interpretation of subsection 20(12) and its application to the facts was such that it justifies an increased award of costs.\n[54] The Court agrees with the Respondent that an award of 75% of the Appellant\u2019s solicitor-client costs is unjustified in view of the jurisprudence of this Court, as summarized above.\n[55] The Respondent has suggested that an award equal to double the Tariff would be appropriate for a one-day hearing without any witnesses. The Court finds that this would be inadequate given its consideration of the two factors noted above.\n[56] All things considered, the Court concludes that an award at the lower end of the scale or 20% of solicitor-client costs (plus applicable taxes) would be more appropriate. The Court finds that such an award would adequately contribute to the Appellant\u2019s costs keeping in mind that an award of costs is not intended to fully compensate a party for costs incurred. Such an award would also be in keeping with the notion that an award is discretionary, that it need not be tied to exceptional circumstances but that it should recognize the work accomplished.\n[57] With respect to the Appellant\u2019s request for costs of this motion fixed at $30,000, the Respondent states that it attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of an offer to settle but received no response. It has requested an opportunity to make additional submissions should the Court choose to award costs for the motion.\n[58] In the interest of finality, the Court is inclined to deal with the matter without further submissions from the Respondent. In so doing, it must consider the Appellant\u2019s overall success in this motion. In light of that, the Court fixes the costs of the motion at $6,000 (plus applicable taxes).\n[59] The Appellant is therefore awarded lump sum costs of $65,086 plus an additional $6,000 for this motion for a total of $71,086 (plus applicable taxes).\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 18th day of March 2024.\n\u201cGuy Smith\u201d\nSmith J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 38\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2017-1901(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nEMERGIS INC. v.

Yuan\u201d\nYuan J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 39\nDate: 20240326\nDocket: 2019-2367(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nRAJESH RAMROOP,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nYuan J.\n[1] This is an appeal of a reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year, as reflected in a Notice of Reassessment dated March 14, 2016.\n[2] Under the reassessment, the Minister of National Revenue adjusted the Appellant\u2019s liability under Part I of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (\u201cITA\u201d) to deny the Appellant\u2019s claim for a charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) in respect donations made in 2006 to The Mega Church International (\u201cMega Church\u201d), which claim the Minister had previously allowed when assessing his 2006 tax return as filed.\n[3] The normal reassessment period for the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year lapsed in 2010. Consequently, the Minister relied on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[4] In light of the foregoing, the two issues in the appeal were:\nWhether the Minister was entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period, and\nIf the Minister was allowed to reopen the 2006 tax year, whether the Appellant was entitled to the tax credits claimed in respect of donations made to Mega Church.\nI. BACKGROUND\n[5] In years around 2006, the Appellant was a car mechanic who was employed with different auto dealerships in southern Ontario. He also lived in various residences in southern Ontario during that time.\n[6] When filing his 2006 tax return, he claimed $6,000 as a charitable donation made to Mega Church, attaching a tax receipt issued by the donee.\n[7] In each of the three years prior to 2006, he made charitable donations that were, in aggregate, similar to the $6,000 amount that he claimed in 2006 as donations to Mega Church. The Minister reassessed the Appellant to fully disallow the prior charitable donation claims, primarily on the basis that the Appellant was unable to provide proof of the transfer of funds to the charitable organizations in the course of the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s audit of his tax returns for those years. (The Appellant\u2019s pattern of claiming around $6,000 of charitable donations in his tax return for a year and having the Minister reassess to fully disallow the claim was repeated in 2008 to 2010; however, any details surrounding the donations for this period and the Minister\u2019s basis for denying these tax credit claims were not put into evidence by either party.)\n[8] For the 2003 to 2006 period, the Appellant reported annual employment earnings in the range $30,447 to $47,538 and annual net income in the range $22,936 to $47,538.\nII. BURDEN OF PROOF\n[9] It is well-established that the Minister has the onus of proof when seeking to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period. However, if the Minister satisfies that onus and the substance of the dispute is about entitlement to a claimed tax credit, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to demonstrate that the taxpayer is entitled to the amounts claimed: see, for example, Calphin, 2015 TCC 158.\n[10] At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant\u2019s representative made a tactical decision to not enter any evidence as part of his case, apart from the cross-examination of witnesses called by the Respondent. In doing so, the Appellant\u2019s representative essentially restricted the Appellant\u2019s case in this appeal to the Court\u2019s determination on the issue of whether the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 tax year beyond the normal reassessment period; this is because the Appellant would have the burden of proving entitlement to the tax credits if the Minister was successful on the first issue and yet the Appellant was not entering any evidence to show that he had met the requirements for claiming the charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for a donation to Mega Church.\nIII. REASSESSMENT BEYOND THE NORMAL REASSESSMENT PERIOD\n[11] The relevant portions of paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA provide, as follows:\n(4) Assessment and reassessment \u2013 The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year \u2026 payable under this Part by a taxpayer \u2026 except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act \u2026\n[12] Where the Minister seeks to rely on a taxpayer misrepresentation in a tax return to open up the tax year, the Minister must show that (i) there was a misrepresentation made in the tax return, and (ii) the misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\n[13] In this appeal, the Minister argued that there were two misrepresentations that the Appellant made in his 2006 tax return which would justify reopening the 2006 tax year. The first alleged misrepresentation is the claim for a charitable donation of $6,000 to Mega Church on Schedule 9 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 return for the purpose of receiving a tax credit. The second alleged misrepresentation is the Appellant\u2019s failure to include the name and address for Mr. Nathaniel Okoroafor in box 490 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 return for the purpose of identifying the professional who prepared the return.\n(1) Claiming $6,000 Charitable Donation in T1 Return\n[14] The Minister\u2019s principal argument in support of reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period was that the evidence supports a finding that the Appellant did not make any payments in 2006 to Mega Church and, therefore, the Appellant made a misrepresentation by neglect, carelessness or wilful default in his 2006 T1 return by claiming to have made a $6,000 donation despite not having made a payment or otherwise given value to that entity in the year.\n[15] At the hearing, there was little direct evidence concerning the payments that the Appellant was relying on to support his claim for the $6,000 donation to Mega Church in 2006. That small amount of evidence was given by the Appellant, who was called as a witness as part of the Respondent\u2019s case.\n[16] The Appellant\u2019s testimony was that he attended the Mega Church location on several occasions with his brother in 2006 and, each time, he provided the pastor with a donation by way of a bank draft payable to Mega Church.\n[17] When listening to the Appellant\u2019s testimony, it was my impression that he likely did not try to refresh his memory in the days leading up to the hearing with respect to his 2006 donations to Mega Church and the surrounding circumstances. I was prepared to accept that his failure to accurately recount some of the secondary details was attributable to the passage of time combined with the possibility that he did not bother to refresh his memory. For example, he gave testimony that he received tax receipts from Mega Church contemporaneously with each payment, but this testimony is at odds with the fact that he attached to his 2006 tax return a single Mega Church receipt for $6,000. I reconciled this discrepancy on the basis that the Appellant could have become confused in the course of his testimony between the tax receipts issued by a charitable organization and the purchaser\u2019s copy of a bank draft.\n[18] However, I was unable to resolve the inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s testimony concerning the frequency of his attendance at the Mega Church location, having regard for the impact the differing versions would have had on the number and face amount of bank drafts purchased by the Appellant for payments to Mega Church in 2006 and the number of times he would have had to attend his bank to purchase same.\n[19] The Respondent initially asked the Appellant on the witness stand whether he attended Mega Church weekly and, in response, the Appellant said that the visits were not weekly but probably twice a month. This corresponds to approximately 24 Mega Church visits in 2006. Later, he testified that he attended the Mega Church location three times in 2006 and, on each occasion, he gave Mega Church a donation of $2,000 by way of bank draft. This was his version of events through most of his testimony. However, when the Respondent returned to the topic of Mega Church later in questioning, the Appellant testified that he attended Mega Church with his brother every Sunday; this would correspond to 52 visits in 2006.\n[20] If the Appellant attended the Mega Church on a semi-monthly basis as he initially testified, there would have been 24 bank drafts averaging $250 each. When he said that he attended Mega Church three times in 2006, he also testified that there were three bank drafts delivered for $2,000 each. And, if the Appellant attended Mega Church weekly as he later testified, there would have been 52 bank drafts with average amounts of $115 each. It is important to note that, in advance of each Mega Church visit, the Appellant would have had to go to his bank to purchase a bank draft for his next Mega Church visit.\n[21] I am unable to understand how it is possible for the Appellant to be testifying about his own Mega Church-related activities in 2006 and, in the same testimony, give evidence that suggests different versions of the same events. At one end, he would have attended at his bank on 52 occasions to purchase a bank draft of approximately $115 and, at the other end, he would have attended his bank on three occasions to purchase a bank draft of approximately $2,000. For this reason, I find the Appellant\u2019s testimony concerning his attendance at, and donations to Mega Church, to be neither credible nor reliable.\n[22] While I reject the Appellant\u2019s testimony about attending and making payments to Mega Church in 2006 for the reasons above, I am not satisfied that the rejection of the Appellant\u2019s evidence on the delivery of bank drafts to Mega Church on its own is sufficient to allow me to conclude that the Minister had established on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant did not make payments to Mega Church in 2006 of $6,000 in aggregate.\n[23] I recognize that there are additional evidentiary challenges when one is trying to prove a negative \u2013 in this case that payments alleged to have been made, were not actually made \u2013 but it strikes me that there may have been opportunities for the Respondent to enter evidence in this appeal towards making a prima facie case that the Appellant could not have donated $6,000 in aggregate to the Mega Church in 2006 based on an analysis of his known sources of funds and probable outlays in 2006, which is similar to the approach that the Minister uses in the case of net worth assessments. Perhaps the Respondent did not have the financial data to prepare such an analysis but, whatever the reason, the Respondent did not introduce evidence giving the Court the Minister\u2019s version of the Appellant\u2019s financial situation in 2006 and the improbability of him making $6,000 in donations to Mega Church in 2006.\n[24] The Respondent did put into evidence financial data from the Appellant\u2019s 2001 to 2011 tax returns and invited the Court to take into account patterns concerning the charitable giving reported in those returns to support a finding that the Appellant did not deliver $6,000 in bank drafts to Mega Church in 2006. More particularly, the Respondent drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the $6,000 amount of the Appellant\u2019s claimed donation to Mega Church in 2006 represented 12.62% of the Appellant\u2019s net income for the 2006 taxation year and that, for example, the charitable donations claimed in the years 2003 to 2005 (which were also disallowed by the Minister) represented the range of 17.77% to 26.16% of the Appellant\u2019s net income for those years. The Respondent spent considerable time going over this data when putting it into evidence and in the course of argument. Obviously, on its own, this is not evidence that directly supports the conclusion that the Appellant was unable to purchase $6,000 in bank drafts for payment to Mega Church in 2006, as the amount of the charitable donations claimed in 2006 and the other large donation years were still substantially less than the Appellant\u2019s net income for the year. In my view, statistical measures of the percentage of charitable giving in a year to net income for the year are useful audit tools for the Minister to identify the taxpayers who might be candidates to have their charitable donations more closely scrutinized. However, if the Respondent\u2019s point in all this was that the Appellant could not have the financial resources to make the payments to charities, then more evidence was required on where his 2006 income was going and precluding the possibility that the Appellant had other non-taxable sources of funds to make the donations.\n[25] The Respondent also invited me to consider the Appellant\u2019s failure to produce copies of the bank drafts or any relevant bank statements at the hearing and then draw an adverse inference from the fact that such documents were not put into evidence. The Respondent mostly emphasised the Appellant\u2019s failure to produce copies of bank drafts purchased in 2006 that were payable to Mega Church, together with the fact that the CRA had sent him correspondence in 2006 that insisted on proof of payment in connection with their audit of his charitable donations made in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and, therefore, he should have been on notice to obtain or retain copies of any bank drafts purchased to make donations to Mega Church in 2006. I presume that the Respondent wanted me to draw the adverse inferences that (i) copies of bank drafts payable to Mega Church were not produced because none were purchased, and (ii) the relevant bank statements for 2006 would not contain entries that would correspond to the purchase of bank drafts payable to Mega Church. I have decided that making those adverse inferences cannot be justified in the circumstances. First, the jurisprudence establishes that an adverse inference should only be drawn when the party having the burden of proof has made out a prima facie case (see: Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed.) (Toronto, ON: Lexis Nexis Canada, Inc., 2022), paragraph 6.511). In this case, the Minister had the burden of proof to show that the Appellant could not have made payments to Mega Church of $6,000 in aggregate in 2006 and I did not feel that the Respondent made out a prima facie case through the evidence on this point. Second, it would be inappropriate to draw an adverse inference in circumstances where the party against whose interest the inference would be drawn has a credible explanation for why the evidence was not provided. Here, the Appellant\u2019s explanation was that the documents do not exist because he did not retain them and the banks do not maintain records from so long ago. I would be more inclined to reject the Appellant\u2019s explanation of why he did not retain or obtain the banking-related records if the Respondent was able to show that there was an on-going correspondence exchange with the Appellant concerning the proof of payment for his 2006 charitable donation, well within the time frame during which banks would be expected to retain their client records for a 2006 transaction. However, that was not the nature of the evidence that the Respondent tendered in support of the position that the Appellant \u201cwas put on notice\u201d, so I do not consider the CRA\u2019s correspondence pertaining to the 2003, 2004, and 2005 audit to be relevant for purposes of making an adverse inference from his failure to produce copies of relevant bank drafts evidencing payment to Mega Church in 2006.\n[26] Finally, the Respondent asked me to find that the Appellant likely did not make $6,000 in payments to Mega Church in 2006 because the Mega Church, along with all the other charities he donated to in the 2003 to 2006 period, had their charitable registrations revoked by the Minister in years subsequent to 2006. I am unable to see how the Minister\u2019s revocation of charitable status subsequent to the year of the relevant donation claim can be considered information that calls into question whether the Appellant made payments to Mega Church or any of the other charities to which he claimed to have made donations in 2003 to 2006. Even if the Appellant was aware of the matters that the Minister was reviewing in connection with these entities prior to the revocation of their charitable registrations -- and there was no evidence to suggest that the Appellant was so aware -- his knowledge of this information might speak to his motivations for making the donations, but not whether he actually made the payments to those entities in the years claimed. Again, in this appeal, the onus was on the Minister to show that the payments were not made and the fact that the Minister subsequently revoked the charitable status of those entities is not relevant to that point.\n[27] However, even though I do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s submissions on the significance of this other evidence, I find myself resolving the question at hand by returning to inconsistency in the Appellant\u2019s testimony on his pattern of visits to Mega Church in 2006. Earlier, I said that the Appellant\u2019s failure to provide a consistent account of his 2006 Mega Church transaction pattern led me to reject his testimony as proof of the frequency of his 2006 Mega Church payments and the amount each time. But, the impact of the inconsistency in his testimony on this point goes further. Six thousand dollars is a significant amount of money for any individual and it is inconceivable that a person could purport to be transacting with Mega Church and his bank in aggregate amounts of this magnitude and not clearly recall whether it was 3, 24 or 52 visits or that the face amounts of the bank drafts were $2,000, $250 or $115. While I was prepared to accept some imprecision or small inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s recollection of visits to Mega Church in 2006 and delivery of bank drafts on each visit, I find the fact that the Appellant gave starkly inconsistent accounts of his 2006 visits to Mega Church and, by implication, his visits to his bank to purchase bank drafts for delivery to Mega Church supports the conclusion that the aggregate amount of bank drafts that he gave Mega Church could not have been $6,000. It is on this basis I conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant did not purchase and deliver bank drafts payable to Mega Church in 2006 with face amounts of $6,000 in aggregate.\n[28] Accordingly, the Minister is entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s wilful misrepresentation in his 2006 T1 return that he made $6,000 in aggregate donations to Mega Church in 2016.\nIV. FAILURE TO IDENTIFY MR. OKOROAFOR AS PROFESSIONAL TAX PREPARER ON T1 RETURN\n[29] Having decided above that the Minister is entitled to reassess pursuant to paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s misrepresentation concerning the amount of his donation to Mega Church, it is unnecessary for me to consider the Minister\u2019s secondary argument that the Minister would be entitled to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period for 2006 on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s failure to report in box 490 of his 2006 T1 Return the name and address of the tax professional who prepared the return. But, if I were required to consider the question, I would have found that the Minister cannot rely on this type of misrepresentation to justify a reassessment that disallowed charitable donation tax credits.\n[30] On its face, box 490 of the 2006 T1 Return does not identify the defining features of a person who should be considered to be a \u201cprofessional tax preparer\u201d for this purpose. Moreover, Respondent did not put before me any evidence concerning Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s professional credentials and what guidance, if any, the CRA gave for completing box 490 in its published guide for the 2006 T1 return. Consequently, it\u2019s not clear to me that there is a factual basis for concluding that the Appellant made a misrepresentation due to neglect, carelessness or wilful default by failing to ensure that box 490 included Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s name and address.\n[31] However, even if I were to find that the Appellant made a misrepresentation due to neglect, carelessness, or wilful default by not identifying his tax preparer, I have concluded that subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) would apply to prevent the Minister from using paragraph 152(4)(a) to reassess the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period to deny the charitable donation tax credit in respect a donation to Mega Church.\n[32] The relevant version of subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) provides, as follows:\n(4.01) Assessment to which para. 152(4)(a) or (b) applies \u2013 Notwithstanding subsections [152](4) and (5), an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment to which any of paragraphs 4(a) or 4(b) applies in respect of a taxpayer for a taxation year may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year to the extent that, but only to the extent that, it can reasonably be regarded as relating to,\n(a) where paragraph (4)(a) applies to the assessment, reassessment or additional assessment\n(i) any misrepresentation made by the taxpayer\u2026that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or any fraud committed by the taxpayer\u2026.in filing the return or supplying the information under this Act, \u2026\n[33] Thus, while paragraph 152(4)(a) establishes the circumstances in which the Minister can open a taxpayer\u2019s otherwise statute-barred taxation year, paragraph 152(4.01)(a) places limits on the reassessment power under paragraph 152(4)(a) by requiring that the adjustments in the reassessment be reasonably related to the taxpayer\u2019s misrepresentation. And, in my view, the Minister\u2019s denial of the tax credit in respect of a charitable donation to Mega Church is not an adjustment that can be reasonably regarded as relating to the Appellant\u2019s failure to identify Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s name and address in box 490 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 Return.\nV. ENTITLEMENT TO THE CHARITABLE DONATION TAX CREDIT\n[34] Having determined that the Minister is entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period on the basis of a misrepresentation about the charitable donations made in 2006, I move to the question of whether the Appellant is entitled to a charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for that amount.\n[35] On this question, the burden is on the Appellant to demonstrate that he met the requirements for claiming the tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for a gift made to Mega Church in 2006.\n[36] I agree with the Respondent that the undated receipt numbered 61833 issued to the Appellant by Mega Church did not comply with the requirements prescribed by subsection 3501(1) of the Income Tax Regulations. More specifically, the receipt did not identify the place that the receipt was issued (as required by paragraph 3501(1)(d)) and, since the Appellant testified that his donation was made by way of bank drafts rather than cash, the receipt also did not identify the dates of the gifts or include a brief description of the property (as required by 3501(1)(e.1)). By virtue of paragraph 118.1(2)(a), a donation receipt for a charitable gift that does not include the information prescribed by the Income Tax Regulations cannot be included in the pool of gifts on which a taxpayer can claim a tax credit under subsection 118.1(3), as confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Kueviakoe, 2021 FCA 64.\n[37] Accordingly, the fact that the Mega Church receipt does not comply with subsection 3501(1) of the Income Tax Regulations is dispositive and precludes the Appellant from receiving a tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) for any 2006 gifts to Mega Church covered by that receipt.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[38] I find that the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA and, in so reassessing, the Minister was correct to deny the Appellant\u2019s claim for tax credits under subsection 118.1(3) in respect of any 2006 gifts made to Mega Church represented by receipt number 61833.\n[39] The appeal will be dismissed. There will be no award as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 26th day of March 2024.\n\u201cJohn C.

Introduction\n[1] Mr. Nixon\u2019s Appeal (concerning claimed charitable donations) was heard on May 8-11, 2023. A decision was rendered on August 22, 2023 dismissing the appeal. Pursuant to the decision, costs were payable by the Appellant to the Respondent. If the parties were unable to agree upon costs, the Respondent was to file written submissions concerning costs on or before September 29, 2023. The Appellant had until October 31, 2023 to file any responding written submission. The Respondent filed written submissions on September 29, 2023. The Appellant has not filed any responding submissions.\nII. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[2] The Respondents seeks costs of the litigation (up to and including the trial) beyond the Tariff amounts (\u201cenhanced costs\u201d) in a lump sum of $158,652.80. This amounts to 35% of their solicitor-client costs incurred. The Respondent seeks an additional $6,407.63 in disbursements for a total of $165,060.43.\n[3] Concerning preparation for this cost motion, the Respondent seeks $5,000 in additional costs. This amount is sought on the basis that the Respondent attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of an offer to settle but did not receive a response. Given the lack of a response from the Appellant to the settlement offer, as well as the necessity for the Respondent to provide written submissions on the costs motion, I will grant the $5,000 sought for the costs of this motion.\n[4] The Respondent has set out a number of factors which they state supports their claim for $165,060.43 in litigation costs. I will deal with each of these factors below.\nIII. Analysis\n[5] Section 147 of the Rules gives the Court broad discretion in awarding costs. The section provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to consider in exercising its discretionary power to award costs beyond the Tariff amounts.\n[6] Some key principles of costs awards were helpfully summarized by Justice Lafleur in Hillcore Financial Corporation v. The King, TCC 144 (Tax Court of Canada [General Procedure]), and are reproduced here:\n8. The general rule is that costs should be \u201ccompensatory and contributory\u201d and \u201cnot punitive\u201d (see Grenon v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 89, at para 12). Further, an award of costs is generally not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party (see Velcro Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 273, [ Velcro ], at para 29).\n9. \u2026\n10. The broad discretion of the Court to award costs should not be exercised in an arbitrary manner but must be exercised on a principled basis; further, the quantum of costs must be reasonable and also determined on a principled basis (The Queen v. Lau, 2004 FCA 10, at para 5; The Queen v. Landry, 2010 FCA 135, at paras 22 and 54; Guibord v. Canada, 2011 FCA 346, at para 10 The King v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133, at para 32).\n11. Subsection 147(3) of the Rules provides a list of factors the Court should consider in exercising its discretion to award costs pursuant to subsection 147(1) of the Rules. However, none of the factors listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules are determinative and as such, the Court should consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion (Velcro, supra , at paras 12-13). As indicated by this Court in Velcro , the Tariff is \u201c... a reference point only should the Court wish to rely upon it\u201d (at para 8).\n12. The relevant parts of the Rules read as follows:\n147 (1) The Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.\n\u2026\n(3) In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,\n(a) the result of the proceeding,\n(b) the amounts in issue,\n(c) the importance of the issues,\n(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,\n(e) the volume of work,\n(f) the complexity of the issues,\n(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,\n(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,\n(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,\n(i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,\n(i.1) whether the expense required to have an expert witness give evidence was justified given\n(i) the nature of the proceeding, its public significance and any need to clarify the law,\n(ii) the number, complexity or technical nature of the issues in dispute, or\n(iii) the amount in dispute; and\n(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n\u2026\n14. This Court is not limited to applying the Tariff. Subsection 147(4) of the Rules provides that the Court \u201c... may fix all or part of the costs with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B and, further, it may award a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs\u201d.\n15. The case law has held that \u201c...increased costs beyond the Tariff are not tied to exceptional circumstances, such as misconduct, malfeasance or undue delay\u201d (see Duffy v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 135 [ Duffy ], at para 21; Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v. The Queen, 2013 TCC 275, at para 4; Ford Motor, supra , at para 7). Indeed, recent case law held that a greater recognition of the work involved in tax litigation should be a factor to consider in awarding costs (see Duffy, supra, at para 21; Blackburn Radio Inc. v. the Queen, 2013 TCC 98, at paras 14-15; Invesco Canada Ltd v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 92, at paras 17 and 25; Spruce Credit Union v. The Queen, 2014 TCC 42, at para 52; Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 15, at para 33).\n[7] The Respondent has set out a number of factors that they wish the Court to consider in justifying their claim for enhanced costs. I will focus my attention on these submissions rather than walking through numerous factors which are of no weight to my decision.\nA. Paragraph 147(3)(a): The results of the proceeding\n[8] The Crown was entirely successful. This was not an all or nothing appeal. It was conceivable at the outset of trial that either all or some portion of the Appellant\u2019s claimed gift be allowed, such as the cash contributions made pursuant to the Berkshire Program. As set out in their costs submissions, at one point the Respondent had offered to settle the litigation by allowing $60,000 as a charitable gift allowed to be claimed by the Appellant in the 2003 taxation year.\n[9] This factor does support the Respondent\u2019s claim for a partial indemnity costs of $35%.\nB. Paragraph 147(3)(c): The importance of the issues [10] The Respondent argues that the Nixon decision may influence the next steps for other related litigation files that are being held in abeyance. Given the large volume of decisions dealing with charitable donations, I do not find that the issues in this case were novel, complicated, nor added much precedential value. I find this factor neutral.\nC. Paragraph 147(3)(d): Any offer of settlement made in writing\n[11] The Respondent attempted to settle a portion this matter by way of an offer made on February 25, 2015. The offer would have allowed the Appellant to claim as a donation $60,000 for the 2003 taxation year. This offer was revoked on December 11, 2020. It therefore does not meet the requirements of 147(3)(d)[1]. Nevertheless, case law has consistently found, as I have in this instance, that a settlement offer, even if it does not meet the requirements of 147(3)(d) can be taken into account by the trial judge in awarding costs. The parties are expected to make reasonable settlement offers. The Crown has done so. I will therefore consider the offer as a factor supporting the enhanced costs sought by the Crown.\nD. Paragraph 147(e) The volume of work\n[12] The Respondent has provided detailed submissions supporting the fact that preparing for and conducting this appeal involved a great deal of work. Lawyers and paralegals documented 1848 hours both preparing this matter for trial and conducting the trial. This preparation work includes a large amount of time spent working on a particular undertaking sought by the Appellant. This is referenced simply for the fact that it supports the large amount of hours spent on the file by the Respondent. The hearing took a full sitting week and was scheduled to continue into a second week. The exceptionally large amount of work spent on this matter does support an award for enhance costs as sought by the Respondent.\nE. Appellant chose to mislead the Court\n[13] After hearing the evidence, it was my conclusion that the Appellant\u2019s testimony, in particular concerning the $300,000 he claimed to have gifted in both 2002 and 2003, defied logic and was misleading. Yet I do not feel I should consider increasing costs as a punitive step. I will simply consider this factor in considering whether one party did anything that may have prolonged the trial.\n[14] The Appellant\u2019s testimony in Chief required a fairly extensive cross examination, with numerous documents being put to the Appellant. The cross examination was effective in assisting me to reach many of the conclusions I did in this matter. But, it also resulted in a longer trial than was necessary. I do accept that this factor supports the position of the Respondent concerning costs.\n[15] I should be clear that I am not double counting this factor, it simply supports the conclusion that the Respondent, in spending 1848 hours on this matter, is entitled to enhanced costs in part because of the volume of work required. The Appellant\u2019s conduct at trial added to the volume of work necessary.\nF. Paragraph 147(3)(h): The denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted\n[16] The Respondent claims they are entitled to costs above the tariff in part because the Appellant refused to admit facts that should have been admitted. Specifically the Appellant lead the Respondent to believe that they would challenge the facts surrounding the operation of the Berkshire program, only to inform the Court on the first day of trial that the Appellant did not see the need to put in evidence facts concerning the mechanics of the Berkshire program.\n[17] It is my understanding that to walk through the various component parts of the Berkshire program would have taken several days of additional evidence and several additional witnesses.\n[18] The Respondent also served a request to admit on the Appellant that primarily dealt with the operation of the Berkshire program. The Appellant refused to admit the majority of the facts set out on the basis that he had no knowledge.\n[19] I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that the refusal to admit the facts concerning the operation of the underlying Berkshire program, as well as the lack of communication with the Respondent concerning the Appellant\u2019s intention not to put in issue at trial the various components of the Berkshire program, greatly increased the time spent by the Respondent in preparing for trial. This factor does support the enhanced costs sought by the Respondent.\nG. Paragraph 147(1)(j): The Appellant brought an appeal that was unwinnable and without merit\n[20] The only question before the Court was whether the Appellant made gifts as per the meaning of ss.118.1(1) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) in the 2002 and 2003 taxation years. There is a large body of case law from both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeal concerning various legal issues that arise in some of the charitable gift donation programs.\n[21] As set out in paragraph 44 of the Nixon decision, one such issue is that in order to be a valid gift for Income Tax purposes, the donation of a charitable gift requires an impoverishment of the donor[2]. This factor was explored by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Markou decision.\n[22] The evidence in this case indicated that that the Appellant would have an \u201cannual cash flow benefit\u201d as a result of his participation in the Berkshire program (see paragraph 10 of the Nixon decision). Furthermore, the facts of this matter supported the conclusion that the Appellant was to receive, on the same day he made his donation, the $300,000 amount he paid to the charity (See paragraph 38 (v)(vi) and (vii) and paragraph 40 of the Nixon decision for analysis). Based on numerous objective factors that were prevalent in this matter, I do agree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that this was an unwinnable case for the Appellant. This favours an award beyond the Tariff amount.\n[23] In a recent cost judgment Justice Spiro canvassed various costs awards, providing a helpful analysis as to what the court has awarded[3]. I have reproduced the analysis below:\n[22] I have considered the percentage of costs awarded by the Court, including the following:\nEnhanced Costs Award\nCase\n20%\nGeneral Electric Capital Canada Inc. v The Queen, 2010 TCC 490\n20% (and 60%)\nGrenon v The Queen, 2021 TCC 89\n30%\nKlemen v R, 2014 TCC 369\n35%\nCameco Corporation v The Queen, 2019 TCC 92\n35%\nDamis Properties Inc. v The Queen, 2021 TCC 44\n36%\nCIT Group Securities (Canada) Inc. v The Queen, 2017 TCC 86\n39%\nChad v The King, 2023 TCC 76\n40%\nInvesco Canada Ltd. v R, 2015 TCC 92\n45%\nPaletta Estate v The Queen, 2021 TCC 41\n50%\nUnivar Holdco Canada ULC v The Queen, 2020 TCC 15\nIV. Conclusion [24] In light of my consideration of the factors set out in subsection 147(3) of the Rules, and my review of other Tax Court\u2019s costs decisions, 35% of total costs is an appropriate cost award for the Respondent.\n[25] This amounts to a fixed cost award of $158,652.80. The Respondent is also entitled to recover disbursements of $6,407.63.\n[26] As for the costs of this motion, the Respondent states that they attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of offer to the Appellant, yet received no response. The Appellant also has not made any submissions in this matter. I will therefore award costs for this motion at an additional $5,000 as requested by the Respondent.\n[27] The total amount payable from the Appellant to the Respondent is $170,060.43.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 8th day of January 2024.\n\u201cR.

Overview\n[1] This matter involves a motion made by the Respondent to quash the appeal from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The notice of assessment is dated June 8, 2017 and relates to the Appellant\u2019s 2013 taxation year (the \u201cAssessment\u201d). The Respondent argues that the Appellant has not fulfilled an essential precondition for instituting an appeal as it failed to serve a notice of objection within the time-limits set out in the Act.\n[3] The Respondent therefore argues the appeal \u201cdiscloses no reasonable grounds for appeal\u201d and should be quashed, relying on paragraph 53(1)(d) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).\n[4] The Appellant takes the position that although the Assessment is dated June 8, 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) failed to mail it at that time and a copy was only mailed, at the request of its authorized agent, on June 6, 2022.\n[5] The Appellant therefore argues that the correct date of mailing of the assessment is June 6, 2022 and that it promptly served a notice of objection. As a result, the appeal is properly before this Court and should be heard on its merits.\n[6] For reasons that follow, the Court concludes the appeal should be quashed because the Appellant received or is deemed to have received the Assessment on June 8, 2017. The appeal is therefore out of time.\nII. The Issues\n[7] The issue at the heart of this motion is whether the Appellant received or is deemed to have received the Assessment on June 8, 2017. If the Court concludes in the affirmative, the motion must be allowed and the appeal quashed.\n[8] Alternatively, if the Court concludes that the Assessment was mailed to the Appellant on June 6, 2022 and that a notice of objection was served on June 27, 2022, the motion must be dismissed.\nIII. The Relevant Statutory Provisions\n[9] The following statutory provisions are relevant to this appeal:\n152(8) Assessment deemed valid and binding - An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\n[10] Subsections 244(10), (14) and (15) are set out in Part XV of the Act entitled Administration and Enforcement and subtitled Procedure and Evidence :\n244(10) Proof of no appeal - An affidavit of an officer of the Canada Revenue Agency, sworn before a commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, setting out that the officer has charge of the appropriate records and has knowledge of the practice of the Agency and that an examination of those records shows that a notice of assessment for a particular taxation year or a notice of determination was mailed or otherwise communicated to a taxpayer on a particular day under this Act and that, after careful examination and search of those records, the officer has been unable to find that a notice of objection or of appeal from the assessment or determination or a request under subsection 245(6), as the case may be, was received within the time allowed, shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be received as evidence of the statements contained in it.\n(\u2026)\n244(14) Mailing or sending notice - For the purposes of this Act, where any notice or notification described in subsection 149.1(6.3), 152(3.1), 165(3) or 166.1(5) or any notice of assessment or determination is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice or notification.\n(\u2026)\n244(15) Date when assessment made - If any notice of assessment or determination has been sent by the Minister as required by this Act, the assessment or determination is deemed to have been made on the day of sending of the notice of the assessment or determination.\n(\u2026)\n[11] Section 248 is set out in Part XVII of the Act entitled Interpretation and contains a number of definitions including the following:\n248(7) Receipt of things mailed - For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) anything (other than a remittance or payment described in paragraph 248(7)(b)) sent by first class mail or its equivalent shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it was sent on the day it was mailed; and (\u2026)\nIV. The Relevant Facts.\n[12] By way of background, the Appellant was a non-resident of Canada with an office in London, Ontario. On April 17, 2013, it redeemed 30% of its shares held by a Delaware corporation and withheld tax at the rate of 5%.\n[13] On June 8, 2017, the Minister assessed the Appellant for a total of $609,193 (including penalties and interest) on the basis that the appropriate withholding rate was 15%. Further details are set out in the notice of appeal filed herein.\n(1) Evidence of the Respondent\n[14] In support of its motion to quash the appeal, the Respondent submitted three affidavits prepared in accordance with subsection 244(10) of the Act. All of the affiants were called as witnesses at the hearing.\nA - Michele Nguyen [15] Ms. Nguyen was an officer in the Toronto Litigation Office of the CRA. She claimed to have appropriate knowledge of the records and practise of CRA and had examined the specific records pertaining to the Appellant.\n[16] She referred to a database used to store all electronic correspondence sent to taxpayers in a system referred to as \u201cEnterprise Correspondence Outputs \/ Enterprise Correspondence History\u201d or \u201cECH\u201d. It indicated that the Minister had assessed the Appellant, then known as Sodecia Canada Inc., for the 2013 taxation year by notice of assessment dated June 8, 2017.\n[17] A reproduction of the Assessment, titled \u201cNon-resident tax notice of assessment\u201d, was appended to her affidavit. The mailing address was 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario.\n[18] She explained that it was CRA\u2019s practise to store taxpayer information including address history in an electronic mainframe and that her search of those records confirmed that the Appellant\u2019s mailing address commencing in December 19, 2011, was 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario but that it was changed to 425 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario effective June 9, 2020.\n[19] The CRA records indicated that the Appellant had not filed a notice of objection to the Assessment but that it purported to do so on June 27, 2022. By letter dated August 31, 2022, CRA advised that the purported notice of objection could not be accepted as it had not been filed within 90 days from the date of the Assessment.\nB - Grant Hutter\n[20] As set out in his affidavit, Mr. Hutter described himself as a \u201cPrograms Officer in the Non-Resident Source Deductions (NRSD) System Support Section, Debt Management Systems Division, Technology and Business Systems Division, Technology and Business Intelligence Directorate of the Collections and Verifications Branch\u201d of the CRA. By virtue of his duties, he had personal knowledge of the manner in which CRA maintained a daily Enterprise Automated Outputs (EAO) NRSD summary report of a notice of assessment.\n[21] He provided a detailed explanation of the various steps involved in the preparation and printing of the EAO NRSD Summary resulting in the creation of a report with cycle run dates and cycle number that corresponded to the issue date of the notice of assessment.\n[22] In particular, Mr. Hutter explained that the EAO NRSD Summary report was stored electronically in an excel file for future reference and that he had consulted such a report to confirm that the run date was processed on June 6, 2017, being two business days prior to the actual date of the assessment.\n[23] As a result of his enquiries, he was able to determine that the Assessment was released from the EAO NRSD summary as batch cycle 1927 which ran on June 6, 2017, with a notice date of June 8, 2017. He attached a computer printout report highlighting the cycle number and indication that there were no errors in the cycle.\n[24] Mr. Hutter also consulted what he referred to as the \u201cSummerside Daily Report\u201d for the 2013 taxation year printed as part of a file provided to Summerside for cycle 1927. He explained that the job quantity and total job quantities were reconciled against the EAO NRSD Summary for continuity purposes.\nC - Joanne Myers\n[25] Ms. Myers explained that she was acting manager of the \u201cPrint to Mail Division\u201d at the Taxation Centre located in Summerside, PEI, that she had charge of the records mailed from the Print to Mail Divisions and knowledge of the agency\u2019s practises. She had also examined the electronic print records of the Appellant in connection with the assessment for the 2013 taxation year.\n[26] She explained the CRA followed a set of procedures for communicating with taxpayers in writing and that one of these procedures included the use of two \u201cPrint to Mail\u201d sites located in Summerside, PEI and Sudbury, Ontario.\n[27] Ms. Myers explained that all information to be set out in a notice of assessment was formatted electronically via an automated process and the data was released electronically to the Print to Mail Section for printing. She indicated that a notice of assessment was mailed to a taxpayer no later than three business days from the time the Print to Mail Site received the print file.\n[28] The Print to Mail site was responsible for printing notices of assessment, inserting them into envelopes and having them ready for pick-up by Canada Post. Smaller jobs of fewer than 100 notices were inserted manually into envelopes while larger jobs used a high-speed inserter that mechanically folded the notices and inserted them into envelopes.\n[29] She explained that \u201ccontrol reports\u201d were prepared with a \u201cjob ticket\u201d to monitor and balance documents to be printed and to serve as a check and balance to minimize processing. As well, CRA maintained an \u201cElectronic Daily Mailing Report\u201d showing the daily mailing jobs received, printed and mailed.\n[30] Ms. Myers indicated that she had reviewed the \u201cElectronic Daily Mailing Report\u201d and relevant \u201cElectronic Canada Post Statement\u201d of mailing and had concluded that the proper procedures were followed for EAO cycle 1927.\n[31] She concluded by indicating the print file containing the Appellant\u2019s notice of assessment dated June 8, 2017, was received at the Print to Mail site on June 7, 2017, and released to Canada Post for mailing on June 8, 2017.\n(2) Evidence of the Appellant\n[32] As part of its responding materials to the motion, the Appellant submitted two affidavits. Both affiants testified as well as a former employee.\nA - Shirley Quick\n[33] Ms. Quick worked as a human resources assistant for a related company known as Sodecia Automotive London Inc. (\u201cSodecia\u201d).\n[34] The Appellant and Sodecia shared a leased office space in an industrial building located at 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario until August 2017.\n[35] In July 2017, the offices and management offices were moved on a temporary basis to 2530 Innovation Drive until October 2017 and then to 425 Sovereign Drive, London, Ontario, on a permanent basis.\n[36] Ms. Quick indicated that she helped with the packing and sorting of files from 300 Sovereign Drive to 2530 Innovation Drive and then to 425 Sovereign Drive. To the best of her recollection, no financial or tax-related information was purged from the files as they were moved. All such documents were stored in banker\u2019s boxes or moved in locked filing cabinets.\n[37] She also handled all incoming mail at 300 Sovereign Road. The mail carrier would enter the lobby through the front door of the building and knock on a window looking into the office. If she was present, the mail would be given to her. If no one answered, the mail would be left on the sill in the lobby just outside the office.\n[38] It was her practise to remit any incoming CRA correspondence to Wilma Luesink, Sodecia\u2019s controller. Ms. Luesink ceased working for Sodecia on October 6, 2017 and did not move to the permanent location at 425 Sovereign Drive.\n[39] Ms. Quick explained that there was a double filing cabinet with four drawers, part of which was used by Ms. Leusink. The top drawer was used to keep corporate records and the second drawer for tax records.\n[40] Ms. Quick indicated that in 2023 she searched this filing cabinet by removing all files. She was able to locate a file with tax documents that she provided to Jose Antunes, the accounting and tax manager for Sodecia and the Appellant.\n[41] She concluded that she had no recollection of a tax assessment addressed to the Appellant in June 2017 and was unable to find one when she completed her search of Sodecia\u2019s files in 2023.\nB - Wilma Luesink [42] Ms. Luesink worked for Sodecia from 1999 to October 2017. During the relevant period, she worked as \u201csenior accountant\u201d and was responsible for all financial matters including payment of invoices, month-end reporting, financial statements as well as health and dental benefits and payroll for over 100 employees. She had no formal training and had initially worked in \u201caccounts payable.\u201d\n[43] All incoming mail involving GST\/HST or taxes was given to her. CRA correspondence would be opened and put away in the filing cabinet or sent to the finance manager or a scanned copy would be sent to the US office. She would not deal directly with tax matters.\n[44] The management offices were located off the main lobby and the production facilities were located at the rear of the building. She confirmed Ms. Quick\u2019s testimony as to how mail was delivered by the mail carrier, adding that there was no receptionist during the relevant period. In particular, she confirmed that mail could be left on the sill located in the lobby, just outside the office.\n[45] She also corroborated the testimony of Ms. Quick, indicating that she had the use of a filing cabinet located outside her office in a space with the workstations and cubicles for other employees. She had use of the two top drawers of that filing cabinet and CRA mail was filed in the second drawer.\n[46] Ms. Luesink was aware of the dispute involving an assessment relating to the Appellant\u2019s 2013 taxation year but she could not specifically recall seeing the Assessment. She could only provide her recollection as to how they dealt with any incoming mail including CRA correspondence.\n[47] She confirmed that her team was relocated to 2530 Innovation Drive in August 2017 and the filing cabinet with the various records, including any CRA correspondence, was moved to this temporary location and placed by her desk.\n[48] She had no knowledge of how records were dealt with after her departure.\nC - Jose Antunes [49] Mr. Antunes assumed the role of accounting and tax manager of Sodecia and the Appellant in May 2020 but his office was located in the State of Michigan, USA. He confirmed that the Appellant was unable to locate the Assessment and that CRA had mailed it to them in June 2022.\n[50] Although he was aware of the various office moves, he had no personal knowledge of the practice for handling mail at 300 Sovereign Road.\n[51] He expressed the view that the Assessment was material and that either Ms. Quick or Ms. Luesink, the controller at the time, would have recognized its significance had it been mailed to 300 Sovereign Road in June 2017.\n[52] Mr. Antunes noted that the Assessment was addressed to the Appellant at 300 Sovereign Road but that the CRA letter refusing to accept the purported notice of objection of June 2022 was addressed to 425 Sovereign.\n[53] His affidavit included Articles of Amendment dated April 17, 2017 whereby \u201cSodecia Canada Inc.\u201d changed its name to \u201cSodecia Canada Investments Inc.\u201d\nV. Analysis and Discussion\n[54] As noted in Canada (National Revenue) v. ConocoPhilips Canada Resource Corp., 2014 FCA 297 (\u201cConocoPhilips\u201d), the outcome of this motion is of singular importance to the Appellant because an assessment is deemed to be valid and binding unless varied or vacated on appeal, as set out in subsection 158(2).\n[55] Service of a valid notice of objection \u201cis a condition precedent to the institution of an appeal.\u201d If there is no evidence of a valid notice of objection, the appeal should be quashed as the Court has no jurisdiction \u201cto further extend the time for equitable reasons\u201d: Bormann v. Canada, 2006 FCA 83 (paras. 3-6).\n[56] Where a taxpayer alleges that a notice of assessment was not received, the Court must consider the \u201cfull evidentiary record with regard to the statutory presumption found in subsection 244(14) of the Act (which presumes a notice of reassessment to have been mailed on its date)\u201d (ConocoPhilips, para. 8).\n[57] In this instance, both parties agree that an appropriate analytical framework, involving a four-step test, was described by Justice Graham in Mpamugo v. HMTQ, 2016 TCC 215 (\u201cMpamugo\u201d) (para. 6) (aff\u2019d 2017 FCA 136).\n[58] The first step involves an assertion by the taxpayer that the notice of assessment was not mailed at all or was not mailed to the correct address.\n[59] The second step requires that the Minister prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the notice of assessment was mailed. If the Minister is able to do so, the mailing is presumed to have occurred on the date set out in the assessment.\n[60] Use of the word \u201cpresumed\u201d in subsection 244(14), gives rise to a rebuttable presumption. As part of the third step, the taxpayer may introduce evidence to prove that the assessment was actually mailed on a different date or to the wrong address. Justice Graham went on to explain the fourth step as follows:\nStep 4: Once the mailing date is established (either through the presumption or through proof of a different date), the assessment is deemed to have been made on that date (subsection 244(15)) and the Notice of Assessment is deemed to have been received on that date (subsection 248(7)). These deeming provisions are not rebuttable. (\u2026)\n[61] In order to prove mailing, the Minister may rely on an affidavit prepared pursuant to subsection 244(10) where a CRA officer attests to being in charge of the appropriate records and having knowledge of the practises of CRA and indicates that he or she has examined the records for a particular taxpayer and that those records show that a notice of assessment has been sent. Absent any proof to the contrary, such an affidavit may suffice to prove mailing: (Mpamugo, para. 12).\n[62] If the Minister is unable to rely on such an affidavit, it needs to adduce evidence \u201cto show that it is more likely than not that the Notice was mailed\u201d and \u201cso long as the Crown can introduce some evidence that the mailing occurred, with no credible evidence to counter the Crown\u2019s evidence, the conclusion should be that the Crown has proven mailing\u201d (Mpamugo, para. 13).\n[63] In Barrington Lane Developments Limited v. The Queen, 2010 TCC 388, the taxpayer had argued that the evidence of mailing was insufficient. Justice Pizzitelli reviewed the evidence of two CRA employees who outlined the mailing process including the electronic downloading of the information for the assessment, the transfer of that information to a printing and mailing site in Canada with a log containing the date of shipping, a tracking number, the name of the taxpayer and a cycle number referencing the batch of notices sent on that day.\n[64] In the end, Justice Pizzitelli was satisfied with the evidence, concluding that \u201cthe detailed and documented processes dealing with the electronic downloading, printing and mailing of the notices of assessment\/reassessment constitute, on a balance of probabilities, prima facie proof that they are mailed\u201d (para. 11.)\n[65] In this instance, the Crown submitted the affidavit of Ms. Nguyen made pursuant to subsection 244(10). She also testified and confirmed that she had accessed the CRA records containing all correspondence to or from the Appellant including the Assessment. From her analysis of those records, she was able to confirm that the Assessment was mailed on June 8, 2017 and that a timely notice of objection had not been filed.\n[66] The computer printouts appended to Ms. Nguyen\u2019s affidavit, indicate that outgoing CRA mail addressed to the Appellant at 300 Sovereign Road was being returned. The address was updated to 425 Sovereign Road effective June 9, 2020 but this appears to have been done internally by cross checking records. There was no suggestion the Appellant had provided a notice of change of address prior to that time, despite the evidence it moved to 425 Sovereign Road in October 2017.\n[67] This change of address would have explained why the Assessment was sent to the Appellant at the 300 Sovereign Road but the \u201crefusal\u201d letter, described in the affidavit of Mr. Antunes, was addressed to 425 Sovereign Road.\n[68] Moreover, the Court notes that the Assessment was addressed to \u201cSodecia Canada Inc.\u201d but the cover letter containing the purported notice of objection of June 27, 2022, informed CRA that the Appellant\u2019s had changed its name to \u201cSodecia Canada Investments Inc.\u201d effective April 7, 2017. This matter was not addressed and no explanation was provided to explain a gap of over five years.\n[69] Mr. Hutter provided a detailed explanation of the preparation of non-resident notices of assessment, the process for downloading that information to an excel file to be sent to a mailing centre with the cycle run date and cycle number that corresponded to the issue date of the Assessment. He was also able to cross-check that information with the records from the mailing centre.\n[70] Similarly, Ms. Myers provided a detailed explanation of the receipt of the information that was released electronically to the Print to Mail section in Summerside, PEI where she worked. She also cross-checked that information with the daily mailing report and electronic Canada Post statement.\n[71] There is no need to repeat their testimony in further detail and I do not propose to do so. The Court finds the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses was both credible and convincing and unshaken by cross-examination.\n[72] As a result, the Court concludes that it is more likely than not that the Assessment was sent and that the Minister has established, on a balance of probabilities, that it was mailed to the Appellant on June 8, 2017.\n[73] I now turn to the evidence adduced by the Appellant.\n[74] The Court agrees with the Respondent that there are gaps in the Appellant\u2019s evidence. The first concern is that mail delivered to 300 Sovereign Road could be left unattended in the lobby that was accessible to anyone who entered the building.\n[75] Secondly, Ms. Quick indicated she had no recollection of the Assessment but this is not surprising since all CRA correspondence was given to Ms. Luesink. There was no suggestion that Ms. Quick would actually open the envelopes.\n[76] Similar concerns arise with Ms. Leusink\u2019s evidence. If the CRA correspondence contained an assessment, this was not an \u201caction item\u201d or another invoice to be paid as part of her daily routine. Since she was not directly involved in taxes, she was only expected to do determine to whom it should be given. Her evidence was that she would provide the envelope to the finance manager or send a scanned copy to the US office. It was not clear how that decision was made but the Court may reasonably infer that the finance manager, as Ms. Luesink\u2019s superior, would have decided what was to be done.\n[77] None of the witnesses provided any information about the finance manager or where that person\u2019s office was located. The Court may reasonably infer that it was located in the same building as part of the \u201cmanagement offices\u201d. If so, the envelope containing the Assessment would likely have been remitted directly to that person and there was no need for Ms. Luesink to include a copy in her tax file.\n[78] The fact that Ms. Quick had searched the filing cabinet in 2023 and determined that the Assessment was not in the tax file does not seem surprising because it did not have any direct bearing on Ms. Leusink\u2019s duties.\n[79] To provide further context, Ms. Quick and Ms. Luesink worked for the operating company known as Sodecia Automotive London Inc. and not directly or only indirectly for the Appellant. Even if they had received the Assessment in June 2017, the Court may reasonably infer that it was not of much concern to them because it was addressed to the Appellant and not their direct employer.\n[80] Moreover, both Sodecia and the Appellant were in the midst of a relocation from 300 Sovereign Road to a temporary location in July 2017. This raises the possibility that the envelope containing the Assessment was simply put aside to be dealt with at a point in time and possibly misplaced or forgotten.\n[81] In the end, the evidence is inconclusive. The Court finds that the Appellant has not rebutted the presumption that the Assessment was mailed on June 8, 2017.\nVI. Conclusion\n[82] Since the Court has concluded that the Assessment \u201chas been sent by the Minister\u201d, a proper reading of subsection 244(15) is that \u201cthe assessment (\u2026) is deemed to have been made on the day of sending the notice of assessment\u201d, being June 8, 2017. A similar conclusion arises from subsection 248(7).\n[83] For all the foregoing reasons, the Court orders and adjudges that the appeal be quashed with costs to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 27th day of March 2024.\n\u201cGuy Smith\u201d\nSmith J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 40\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-3160(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSODECIA CANADA INVESTMENTS INC. v.

I will refer to the appeals of the 79 named Appellants as the \u201c79 Appeals\u201d.\n[2] The 79 Appellants argue that the Court should allow the 79 Appeals because of a delay in the hearing of the appeals caused by the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the appeal of the three appellants in Choptiany v. The King (\u201cChoptiany et al.\u201d).[1]\n[3] During an October 12, 2022 case management conference, counsel for the Appellants noted that he intended to file this motion with respect to the 79 Appeals. I informed the parties during the hearing and subsequently ordered, that the motion would proceed as follows:\n-The Appellants were to file their motion on or before November 14, 2022, returnable on March 10, 2023.\n-The Appellants\u2019 motion record was to be filed on or before December 12, 2022.\n-The Respondent\u2019s motion record was to be filed on or before January 23, 2023.\n-The Appellants\u2019 reply submissions, if any, were to be filed on or before February 26, 2023.\n[4] In a motion such as the one before the Court, the submissions must set out a party\u2019s complete argument. The Court does not allow a party to ambush the other party by raising an argument for the first time at the hearing of the motion.\n[5] The Appellants filed their motion record on December 12, 2022. It contained four and a half pages of actual written submissions. The Appellants did not file any affidavit evidence to support the factual assertions made in their brief submissions.\n[6] The Respondent\u2019s motion record included 10 pages of written submissions together with a lengthy affidavit that provided evidence to support the factual assertions made in his submissions.\n[7] I am troubled by the fact that the Appellants filed sparse submissions in support of a motion in which the Appellants are asking the Court to allow 79 appeals, each involving different taxpayers who were assessed substantial gross negligence penalties. In such a situation, I would expect, at a minimum, that the Appellants file an affidavit containing factual information showing how the conduct of the Respondent in the Choptiany et al. appeals supports their position that the Court should allow the 79 Appeals.\n[8] For example, paragraph 4 of the Appellants\u2019 written submissions states that the Appellants and the Respondent agreed to select three lead cases and that the decision of the lead cases would negate the need for multiplicity of proceedings having regard to the Appellants\u2019 common arguments. The Appellants filed no evidence to support this statement. In fact, as I will discuss, this statement is not supported by the facts placed before the Court by the Respondent.\n[9] If I were to issue my Order based solely on the written submissions of the Appellants, I would summarily dismiss the motion since the Appellants have not provided the Court with evidence to support the factual assertions that form the foundation of their motion.\n[10] However, the Respondent did provide the Court with an affidavit containing relevant facts. My Order is based on the facts contained in the affidavit, the Court\u2019s public files with respect to the 79 Appeals, and the relevant jurisprudence.\nBackground\n[11] The 79 Appellants participated in either the Fiscal Arbitrators or the DeMara Consulting tax schemes (the \u201cFiscal Arbitrators scheme\u201d and the \u201cDeMara scheme\u201d). It appears that some of the Appellants participated in both schemes.\n[12] The Federal Court of Appeal, at paragraph 3 of its reasons in Kim v. Canada,[2] described the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme as follows:\nMr. Kim was employed by Bombardier Inc. and he reported employment income of $81,568 in 2009 and $85,568 in 2010. He also claimed business losses of $256,375 in 2009 and $114,848 in 2010. Mr. Kim\u2019s claim for business losses appears to have been based on information that he received from DSC Lifestyle Services. This organization was associated with the tax preparer known as \u201cFiscal Arbitrators\u201d. The claimed business losses appear to have been based on Mr. Kim\u2019s unrealistic notion that his employment income was linked to an artificial legal entity and that it was possible to distinguish between this artificial legal entity and a human being. He could therefore have his artificial entity pay his real entity expenses which resulted in the losses that he had claimed.\n[13] I found in Bradshaw v. The Queen[3] that the plan, as described by a representative of the Fiscal Arbitrators organization to Mr. Bradshaw, was patently absurd.\n[14] The DeMara scheme was described by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada v. Rattai[4] (\u201cRattai\u201d) at paragraph 1, as follows:\nDeMara Consulting Inc. (DeMara) promoted a program to clients (called members) under which DeMara prepared and filed income tax returns for members and their spouses. To become members, individuals were required to complete a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement and to provide DeMara with detailed personal information including about personal living expenses and personal debt\/financing obligations. DeMara used this information to prepare T5 and T5008 forms and then prepared members\u2019 returns deducting the personal expenses as business losses and treating them as capital losses. DeMara also required members to appoint DeMara as their authorized representative with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).\n[15] The principals of Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara were criminally convicted for their actions in preparing income tax returns for a large number of taxpayers in which the taxpayers claimed fictitious business losses.\n[16] The Minister has assessed hundreds of taxpayers for their participation in these schemes. The assessments denied the substantial fictitious business losses claimed by the taxpayers and imposed gross negligence penalties.\n[17] Beginning around 2010 and continuing for the next 9 or 10 years, approximately 1,000 of these taxpayers (including the 79 Appellants) appealed the assessments to this Court. In the early 2010s, most of the appeals involved Fiscal Arbitrators.\n[18] The taxpayers were located in all regions of the country. A large number of the appellants were self-represented before the Court.\n[19] As is the Court\u2019s practice when dealing with a large group of appellants who have participated in the same scheme or tax shelter, a case management judge was appointed to manage the appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara scheme.\n[20] Chief Justice Rip (as he then was) was the first case management judge for this group of appeals. My colleague, Justice Boyle, replaced Chief Justice Rip in late 2015. I then replaced Justice Boyle as case management judge in the fall of 2021.\n[21] At various times since the appeals were filed, the Court has issued orders holding the appeals in abeyance.\n[22] It appears that Chief Justice Rip issued the first Order on June 2, 2014. This Order applied to the appellant, Denis Anderson, docket 2010-3038(IT)G, and all other appellants listed in Schedule A to Chief Justice Rip\u2019s Order. Schedule A to the Order included 522 appellants.\n[23] Chief Justice Rip ordered that all 522 appeals and \u201cany future appeals having similar common or related questions of law or fact be stayed sine die.\u201d\n[24] The 522 appellants named in Chief Justice Rip\u2019s Order had participated in either the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme or the DeMara scheme. Therefore, the Order stayed all future appeals relating to either scheme.\n[25] The 522 appellants listed in Schedule A to the June 2, 2014 Order include 40 of the 79 Appellants. One other of the 79 Appellants was subject to a similar Order issued by Chief Justice Rip on June 24, 2014.\n[26] It appears that Justice Boyle issued similar orders. For example, on November 25, 2016, Justice Boyle issued an Order staying the appeal of Judy Davey, docket 2016\u20111701(IT)G, who is one of the 79 Appellants. The Order states that Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal and \u201cany future appeals having similar common or related questions of law or fact be stayed sine die.\u201d\n[27] As a result, the appeals of any of the 79 Appellants who were not specifically mentioned in an order of Chief Justice Rip or Justice Boyle were stayed since they were appeals with respect to the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara schemes.\n[28] Justice Boyle held a status hearing in Winnipeg in October of 2016 for 78 appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara schemes (the \u201cOctober 2016 Status Hearing\u201d). Counsel for the 79 Appellants represented all of the 78 appellants.\n[29] During the status hearing, Justice Boyle noted that Chief Justice Rip, during his time as case management judge, had released a third of the appeals relating to the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme or the DeMara scheme from being held in abeyance. Justice Boyle noted that since becoming case management judge, he had released another third of the appeals from being held in abeyance.\n[30] He indicated that he intended to release the appeals of the appellants before him from abeyance that day and provide dates for the completion of the litigation steps.[5]\n[31] Counsel for the appellants then argued that only one appeal involving an appellant who had participated in the DeMara scheme should proceed and that the remaining appeals should be held in abeyance. He referred to the one appeal that should proceed as an informal lead case, since the decision in that appeal would not be binding on the other appeals.\n[32] He stated that his legal argument was the same for all of the 78 appellants who were before the Court and this argument was not dependent on the facts of a particular appeal. When asked whether all of the appellants were only involved with DeMara, he noted that the appellants were involved with both the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes, but that a significant portion were appellants involved only with DeMara.\n[33] Counsel for the appellants noted that all of the appellants were only challenging the gross negligence penalties; they were not challenging the underlying assessments.[6]\n[34] Counsel for the Respondent had reservations concerning the appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s suggested approach at that time. He noted that appeals, such as the ones before the Court, are fact-based, meaning that each case will turn on its own facts. The Respondent\u2019s position was that there was no need for lead cases. He also noted that there were dozens of cases involving the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes that had already been decided by this Court.\n[35] Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that it was a unique situation to have 78 appellants represented by the same counsel. While the Respondent would accept informal lead cases, he would not agree to be bound by the lead cases. He noted that the result in such informal lead cases may affect the Respondent\u2019s risk assessment with any subsequent cases. He also noted that while counsel was located in Winnipeg, the appellants before the Court were located across the country.\n[36] Counsel for the Respondent left it to the Court to decide how the Court wished to proceed, but wanted more than one test case so that the Court was presented with a \u201cgood cross section that is representative of the facts\u201d.[7]\n[37] Justice Boyle then gave the parties 30 days to come to an agreement on lead cases with respect to the 78 appellants. In a letter dated December 8, 2016,[8] the parties identified the appeals of three taxpayers: two appeals by Sandra McPherson, which related to both the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes; one appeal by Thor Choptiany, which related to the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme; and one appeal by Wayne Richter, which related to the DeMara scheme.\n[38] While the parties referred to the appeals of the three named taxpayers as lead cases, I will refer to them as \u201cinformal lead cases\u201d since they were not true lead cases. Lead cases are appeals in respect of which other appellants agree to be bound by the Court\u2019s finding in such appeals. The facts before me are that only one appellant agreed to be bound by the decision in the three informal lead cases. That appellant was Mr. Richter, who agreed that the decision in his informal lead case would determine the result in a second Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeal that he had before the Court. This makes sense since gross negligence looks to the actions of the appellant and Mr. Richter was the appellant in both appeals.\n[39] Justice Boyle issued an Order on January 11, 2017 (the \u201cJanuary 2017 Abeyance Order\u201d), setting out a timetable for the completion of the litigation steps in the informal lead cases, and ordering that all other matters listed in Schedule A to his Order be held in abeyance pending the decision in the (informal) lead cases.[9] There are 78 appeals listed in Schedule A to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. The schedule included appellants who appeared at the status hearing, plus four additional appeals.\n[40] In an Order dated October 5, 2022, Justice Boyle granted the appellants\u2019 motion in the informal lead cases, allowing their appeals and vacating the gross negligence penalties.[10] He found that \u201c[t]he Respondent has adopted and demonstrated a consistent pattern of non-compliance with this Court\u2019s Orders and Rules with respect to CRA\u2019s audits and investigations involving the Appellants.\u201d[11]\n[41] These non-compliances were in respect of the Respondent\u2019s discovery nominee\u2019s failure to properly inform himself with respect to whether the CRA had instigated criminal investigations into the three appellants in the informal lead cases, as well as the failure of the Respondent to comply with Justice Boyle\u2019s orders with respect to disclosure of CRA investigations, such as criminal investigations of each of the three appellants, including CRA projects where the appellants were mentioned.\n[42] Justice Boyle allowed the appeals under the Court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its process. In his reasons, my colleague emphasized that this is a remedy of last resort, but that the continuing failure of the Respondent to comply with the Rules of the Court and his orders justified allowing the appeals.\n[43] At the time that I became case management judge, only 60 appeals remained before the Court with respect to appellants who had only participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme. Approximately 185 appeals were before the Court that related to the DeMara scheme, although some taxpayers participated in both schemes. The appellants in these appeals were located in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Kelowna, Lethbridge, Nelson, Regina, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Prince George, Toronto and Windsor.\n[44] Once I became case management judge, I decided to remove all of the outstanding appeals from abeyance, except for the appeals of the 78 appellants that were being held in abeyance under the January 2017 Abeyance Order and a number of DeMara-related appeals that the Court was holding in abeyance until such time as the Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision in Rattai.\n[45] Currently, none of the Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeals are being held in abeyance. I released the appeals subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order from abeyance once Justice Boyle issued his decision in Choptiany et al. in October of 2022, and I released the relevant DeMara appeals once the Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision in Rattai in June of 2022.\n[46] As previously noted, a case management conference was held on October 12, 2022 with respect to the 79 Appeals, which resulted in the 79 Appellants filing this motion.\nPosition of the Parties\n[47] Relying mainly on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v Jordan[12] (\u201cJordan\u201d), the Appellants argue that the 79 Appeals should be allowed because of a delay in the hearing of the appeals due to the actions of the Respondent in the informal lead cases.\n[48] The Appellants argue that the selection of the informal lead cases and the holding of the 79 Appeals in abeyance was ordered by the Court on the understanding that this would be the most just and expeditious means of resolving the group of appeals, whereby the decisions of the lead cases would negate the need for multiplicity of proceedings having regard to the Appellants\u2019 common arguments.\n[49] They argue that the delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals is unjustified and prejudicial and was caused by a serious abuse of the Court\u2019s processes. Counsel for the 79 Appellants argued that if the Appellants\u2019 motion is not granted, then the CRA, having lost the three informal lead appeals while gaining advantage in a hundred others, will be rewarded rather than punished for years-long abuse and games-playing.\n[50] In his written submissions, counsel for the 79 Appellants stated the following with respect to what would occur if I were to dismiss the motion before the Court: \u201cThis would be a repugnant result, effectively overturning the immensely important ruling of this court in Choptiany thereby bringing the integrity of this court into disrepute.\u201d\n[51] This is not an acceptable statement or argument to make before this Court. It is disrespectful. The fact that the Court\u2019s decision is not the decision that the Appellants hoped for is not repugnant and does not bring the integrity of the Court into disrepute. It is a decision that is based upon the facts in front of me and the applicable law.\n[52] Counsel for the 79 Appellants seems to have forgotten that he is an officer of the Court. He must not make disrespectful statements that question the integrity and competence of the Court.\n[53] The Respondent raises a number of arguments in support of his position that the motion should be dismissed:\n-An appeal held in abeyance is an inactive appeal that inherently involves delay. This delay was the result of the Appellants requesting the appeals to be held in abeyance.\n-With the exception of a second appeal by one of the Appellants in the informal lead cases, the Court\u2019s decision in Choptiany et al. was never intended to be dispositive of the 79 Appeals. The determination of whether an individual taxpayer is liable for the subsection 163(2) gross negligence penalty is dependent on the conduct of the individual taxpayer. As a result, the appeals are fact-based and each case will turn on its own facts.\n-With the exception of the one appeal, the Respondent never agreed to be bound by the decision in the lead cases. This was made clear to the Court and the Appellants. The parties did not agree that any decision in the informal lead cases would negate the need for more litigation.\n-Delay on its own is not sufficient to allow these appeals. The delay must result in an abuse of the Court\u2019s process.\n-The Jordan principle is not applicable here\u2014that case is about the right of any person charged with a criminal offence to be tried within a reasonable period of time pursuant to section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Its application is limited to criminal law.\n-The Respondent did not maliciously or abusively delay the 79 Appeals. The Appellants offer no support for their allegation that the Respondent lost the lead appeals to gain an advantage in hundreds of others; the delay has no benefit to the Respondent.\n-The abuse found in Choptiany et al. was not abuse in these appeals. The Respondent has gained no advantage as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in the Choptiany et al. appeals and has not abused the discovery process in these appeals. On the contrary, two of the Appellants have previously filed joint applications for hearing in their appeals, certifying that their appeals are ready for trial.[13]\nDisposition of Motion\nA. Preliminary Issues\n[54] Four of the 79 appeals named in this motion were not subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. In particular, the appeals of Judy Davey, docket 2016\u20111701(IT)G; Heath Avery, docket 2016\u20115256(IT)G; Armin Mantei, docket 2016-3988(IT)G; and Michael Brouwer, docket 2019-614(IT)G were not subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order.\n[55] It is not clear to the Court how three of these appeals relate to the 78 appeals that were held in abeyance pursuant to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. The Appellants filed no factual information with respect to any of the four noted appeals.\n[56] The Court\u2019s file for the Davey appeal indicates the following:\n-Ms. Davey lives in British Columbia, and was self-represented at the time that Justice Boyle issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on November 25, 2016 holding her appeal in abeyance.\n-Her appeal appears to have been removed from abeyance shortly thereafter since, on May 3, 2017, the Appellant and the Respondent jointly submitted a timetable for the completion of the litigation steps.\n-The Court issued a timetable Order on May 31, 2017.\n-Ms. Davey retained the Rotfleisch & Samulovitch law firm around July 24, 2017.\n-On July 25, 2017, the parties filed a request to amend the Court\u2019s May 31, 2017 timetable Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on August 11, 2017, amending its previous timetable Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on September 28, 2018, holding the appeal in abeyance.\n[57] Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal was clearly active after the January 2017 Abeyance Order. This is a different situation than the situation of appellants subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal appeared to be proceeding in a normal manner until the Court\u2019s abeyance Order in September 2018.\n[58] Counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or even argument to explain why Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal should be included with the appeals that were subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. For these reasons, the motion, as it applies to Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal, docket 2016-1701(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[59] The Court\u2019s file for the Avery appeal indicates the following:\n-Mr. Avery is located in British Columbia and was represented by counsel in British Columbia at the time that he filed his notice of appeal.\n-On May 25, 2017, the parties jointly submitted a timetable for the completion of litigation steps.\n-The Court issued a timetable Order on May 31, 2017 and a revised Order on December 11, 2017.\n-The Court file indicates that the parties completed most litigation steps, including examinations for discovery.\n-On October 16, 2018, Justice Boyle issued an Order adjourning the scheduling of the hearing of the appeal until the Court issued its judgment in five appeals that were then before the Court. These five appeals included the Rattai appeal, but did not include the informal lead cases.\n-On May 23, 2019, the Court set the appeal down to be heard on March 23, 2020 in Victoria. The hearing of the appeal was adjourned to allow the Appellant to retain new counsel.\n[60] This is another appeal that was clearly proceeding to hearing after the Court issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order. In fact, it was scheduled for hearing on two occasions.\n[61] Since counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or argument to explain why Mr. Avery\u2019s appeal should be included with the appeals that were subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order, the motion, as it applies to Mr. Avery\u2019s appeal, docket 2016-5256(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[62] The Court\u2019s file for the Brouwer appeal indicates that the notice of appeal was filed on February 5, 2019, two years after the January 2017 Abeyance Order. Since counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or argument to explain how an appeal filed two years after the January 2017 Abeyance Order relates to the appeals subject to that Order, the motion, as it applies to Mr. Brouwer\u2019s appeal, docket 2019\u2011614(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[63] The appeal with respect to Armin Mantei was filed on September 28, 2016. On June 29, 2017, the Appellant was informed that his appeal would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the informal lead cases. Since this occurred approximately five months after the Court issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order, it is self-evident that it should be treated in the same manner as the appeals of the 79 Appellants.\n[64] After this motion was filed by the 79 Appellants, a Consent to Judgment was filed in one of the appeals named in this motion \u2013 the appeal of Wayne Richter, docket 2018-4215(IT)G. As noted previously, Mr. Richter agreed to be bound by the decision in the informal lead cases. As a result, the motion as it applies to Mr. Richter\u2019s appeal is moot and is dismissed.\n[65] Subsequent to the filing of this motion, the appeals of Joseph Caro, docket 2013-4053(IT)G; Thomas Bastien, docket 2013-4228(IT)G; and Henry De Boon 2014-957(IT)G were discontinued. The motion as it applies to these three appeals is moot and is dismissed.\nB. The Remaining Appellants\n[66] I will now address the motion as it applies to the remaining Appellants. My reasons apply equally to the Davey, Avery and Brouwer appeals. For simplicity, I will continue to refer to the appeals as the 79 Appeals and the Appellants as the 79 Appellants. However, my reasons that follow do not apply to the Richter appeal, the Caro appeal, the Bastien appeal and the De Boon appeal.\n[67] In R. v. Cunningham,[14] Rothstein J. wrote for the Supreme Court of Canada:\n[18] Superior courts possess inherent jurisdiction to ensure they can function as courts of law and fulfil their mandate to administer justice (see I. H. Jacob, \u201cThe Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court\u201d (1970), 23 Curr. Legal Probs. 23, at pp. 27\u201128). Inherent jurisdiction includes the authority to control the process of the court, prevent abuses of process, and ensure the machinery of the court functions in an orderly and effective manner. ...\n[19] Likewise in the case of statutory courts, the authority to control the court\u2019s process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law. This Court has affirmed that courts can apply a \u201cdoctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication\u201d when determining the powers of a statutory tribunal:\n. . . the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime . ...\n(ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 51)\nAlthough Bastarache J. was referring to an administrative tribunal, the same rule of jurisdiction, by necessary implication, would apply to statutory courts.\n[68] The Tax Court of Canada is both a superior court and a statutory court. As set out by Rothstein J., the Court possesses inherent and implied jurisdiction to control the process of the Court and prevent abuses of process.\n[69] This Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have noted on numerous occasions that the allowing of an appeal by a motions judge on the basis of an abuse of process is a drastic step. As the Federal Court of Canada, Appeal Division noted in Yacyshyn v. Canada at paragraph 18, \u201c\u2026the dismissal of an appeal is a drastic and somewhat ultimate remedy reserved for the egregious case or when no other alternative and less dramatic remedy would be adequate.\u201d This statement applies equally to the allowing of an appeal on account of the conduct of the Respondent.[15]\n[70] In my view, the current situation does not constitute an egregious case that justifies allowing the 79 Appeals. In fact, for the following reasons, the actions of the Respondent in Choptiany et al. do not in any way support the allowing of the 79 Appeals.\n[71] In the first instance, I find that the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the Choptiany et al. appeals is not an abuse of process with respect to the 79 Appeals.\n[72] The abuse of process in the Choptiany et al. appeals arose as a result of the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the examination for discovery of its nominee in the informal lead cases. This related to the disclosure of factual evidence in respect of the three appellants in the informal lead cases, and in particular, factual questions with respect to criminal investigations of the three appellants. This has no relevance to the 79 Appeals.\n[73] Further, the Appellants have produced no evidence to show that the abuse that occurred at the discovery stage in the Choptiany et al. appeals relates to any discovery that has occurred in the 79 Appeals. In fact, it appears from the record that discovery has not occurred in most of the 79 Appeals.\n[74] The only issue is whether the Respondent caused a delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals and whether such a delay constitutes an abuse of process.\n[75] The Appellants rely heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Jordan. As previously noted, this decision relates to an accused charged with a criminal offence, and the right to be tried within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Jordan decision is not relevant to appeals made under the Income Tax Act.\n[76] The Appellants argue that a substantial delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals occurred because a decision in the informal lead cases would have negated the need for proceeding in the 79 Appeals. The Appellants produced no factual evidence to support this claim.\n[77] In fact, the evidence before the Court supports the Respondent\u2019s factual assertion that the informal lead cases were never intended to be dispositive of the 79 Appeals. The Respondent made it clear prior to the appeals being held in abeyance that he would not agree to be bound by the Court\u2019s decision in the informal lead cases.\n[78] More importantly, the determination of a taxpayer\u2019s liability under subsection 163(2) for the gross negligence penalty is dependent on the facts in each particular appeal.\n[79] Subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty on every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a tax return.\n[80] As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Wynter v. Canada,[16] subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty either when the taxpayer has knowledge, or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[81] The knowledge requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer had an actual intent to make a false statement or the taxpayer is wilfully blind. The Federal Court of Appeal explained that:\nA taxpayer is wilfully blind in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth. The concept is one of deliberate ignorance\u2026\n\u2026wilful blindness pivots on a finding that the taxpayer deliberately chose not to make inquiries in order to avoid verifying that which might be such an inconvenient truth. The essential factual element is a finding of deliberate ignorance, as it \u201cconnotes \u2018an actual process of suppressing a suspicion\u2019\u201d \u2026\n[82] The Federal Court of Appeal noted that gross negligence is distinct from wilful blindness. Gross negligence \u201c\u2026arises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable taxpayer.\u201d[17]\n[83] The key issue in the 79 Appeals is the determination of the application of subsection 163(2) to each of the 79 Appellants; this determination requires an inquiry into the knowledge, intention and conduct of the each appellant. As the Respondent correctly noted, it is a fact-based determination and each appeal will turn on its own facts. The facts in the informal lead cases would not be determinative of the application of subsection 163(2) to the 79 Appellants.\n[84] The Choptiany et al. appeals highlighted the fact-specific nature of subsection 163(2) appeals. They were dismissed because of issues with respect to the discovery of facts that were specific to each of the three appellants, namely criminal investigations of each of the appellants.\n[85] As noted, the Respondent clearly stated during the October 2016 Status Hearing that he would not be bound by the informal lead cases.\n[86] During the October 2016 Status Hearing, counsel for the Appellants appears to state that if he loses the informal lead cases, he will not pursue the other appeals. He noted that he had no intention of conducting 65 separate trials since his argument was identical in each of the appeals.[18] It is not clear whether he was speaking for himself or for the 79 Appellants.\n[87] Further, the Appellants have produced no evidence to support their claim that there was a delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals that was unjustified and prejudicial. They put no factual evidence before the Court.\n[88] In the last few years, large group appeals, such as the one before the Court, have become a common occurrence. In many instances, the group appeals involve thousands of appellants. It is simply impossible for the Court to hear all of these appeals at the same time.\n[89] In order to ensure that the Court functions in an orderly and efficient manner, the Court has instituted procedures to manage such appeals, taking into account the resources of the Court; the fact that the Court is a transient court that travels across the country; and the fact that the appellants, in most group appeals, are located in all regions of the country. The Court\u2019s procedures ensure that each appellant is treated fairly and is provided with the opportunity to have their day in court.\n[90] This is what occurred with the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara appeals. The Court first held all of the appeals in abeyance. This allowed the Court to determine the number and nature of the related appeals. At the time of the October 2016 Status Hearing, approximately two-thirds of the Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeals had been released from being held in abeyance.\n[91] Prior to the October 2016 Status Hearing, the Court heard and decided numerous appeals with respect to the application of subsection 163(2) to appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes. The Federal Court of Appeal also heard and decided appeals with respect to each of these schemes.\n[92] This allowed jurisprudence to be developed with respect to the underlying transactions and the various positions that the appellants were taking with respect to the application of subsection 163(2) to their fact-specific situations. As counsel for the Respondent noted, the jurisprudence from these decisions allows the Respondent to conduct a risk assessment with respect to any subsequent appeals. This would apply equally to appellants in such appeals.\n[93] At the October 2016 Status Hearing, Justice Boyle informed the parties that his intention was to remove from abeyance the appeals of the 78 appellants before him and to provide dates for the completion of litigation steps, which would have allowed the appeals to proceed to being heard by the Court.\n[94] The Appellant\u2019s counsel did not want this approach, but rather chose to proceed with informal lead cases and to delay the hearing of the 79 Appeals. Informal lead cases that would not be binding on the Respondent or on the 79 Appellants and would not be determinative of the 79 Appeals, since each of these appeals will be determined based on the particular facts of the appeal.\n[95] Since the Court\u2019s decision in the informal lead cases would not be determinative of the 79 Appeals, such appeals would have continued to hearing regardless of the Court\u2019s judgment in the informal lead cases.\n[96] In such a situation, the Respondent\u2019s actions in the informal lead cases did not constitute an abuse of process with respect to the 79 Appeals.\n[97] The Appellants argue that the Respondent, by his actions in the Choptiany et al. appeals, has gained an advantage in a hundred other appeals. It is not clear to the Court what constitutes this advantage. The Appellants have offered no evidence to support this allegation. As previously noted, each appeal is fact\u2011specific. Further, the Respondent bears the burden of proof to establish the facts supporting the assessment of a penalty under subsection 163(2) against each of the 79 Appellants. In such a situation, it is difficult to see how the disclosure of facts in the informal lead cases conferred an advantage on the Respondent.\n[98] For the foregoing reasons, the motion of the 79 Appellants is dismissed, with costs.\n[99] It is time for the 79 Appellants to proceed to a hearing of their appeals. This will require completion of the required litigation steps. A case management conference for each of the 79 Appellants will be held in Winnipeg on Tuesday, March 12, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. to determine timetables for the completion of all outstanding litigation steps.\nThese Amended Reasons for Order are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Order dated January 17, 2024 in order to amend the Style of Cause, Back Page, Schedule A and to include the words underscored in paragraphs 65 and 66 hereof.\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 31st day of January 2024.\n\u201cS.

Hogan\u201d\nHogan J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 7\nDate: 20240116\nDocket: 2022-848(GST)I\nBETWEEN:\nUN1QUE PRODUCTIONS INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nHogan J.\n[1] This is an appeal from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1] disallowing input tax credits (\u201cITC\u201d) in the amount of $6,690 claimed by the Appellant, Un1que Productions Inc. (\u201cUPI\u201d), for the reporting periods from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015, July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016, July 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 and January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 (the \u201cRelevant Periods\u201d).\n[2] The Minister disallowed the ITCs on the grounds, inter alia, that, during the Relevant Periods, (i) the Appellant was not engaged in a commercial activity; (ii) the claims related to personal expenses of Mr. Christie, the sole shareholder and officer of UPI; and, (iii) the Appellant had failed to obtain and retain documentation in support of the ITC claims as required under subsection 169(4) of the Act and the Regulations.\n[3] UPI defends the contrary position.\n[4] Mr. Christie acted as the agent of UPI for the purposes of its appeal and also appeared as its sole witness.\n[5] By way of background information, Mr. Christie explained how UPI came into existence in or around 2013. Initially, Mr. Christie\u2019s goal was to earn a living in the music industry. His initial experience was disappointing. Mr. Christie testified that he met unsavoury individuals who tried to take advantage of his lack of experience. Mr. Christie alleges that he decided to incorporate UPI to shield himself from personal liability and to explore ways of earning income from a broader sector of activities.\n[6] Mr. Christie explained that, at all material times, his sole source of income was limited to the money and benefits that he receives under the Ontario Disability Support Program (\u201cODSP\u201d). Since inception to the present date, UPI has earned no revenue. Notwithstanding Mr. Christie\u2019s best efforts, UPI has been unable to raise capital or obtain third party financing to fund its activities. Mr. Christie seeks to fund UPI\u2019s activities through the ITC refund claims that have been submitted but disallowed.\n[7] Mr. Christie testified that he views UPI as his alter ego because everything that he does, broadly speaking, will advantage UPI in the long term. Moreover, he was forthright on direct questioning, acknowledging that many of the expenses incurred for goods could indeed be used to satisfy his personal needs.[2] For example, when questioned on cross\u2011examination as to why he submitted an ITC claim in respect of the costs of clothing, food and snacks, Mr. Christie explained that one cannot become active in business without a proper wardrobe.[3]\n[8] At the outset of the hearing, I pointed out to Mr. Christie that, under paragraph 169(1)(b) of the Act, ITCs can only be claimed to the extent to which a registrant has acquired property or services for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity.\n[9] The term \u201ccommercial activity\u201d is defined as follows in subsection 123(1) of the Act:\n. . .\n\u201ccommercial activity\u201d of a person means\n(a) a business carried on by the person (other than a business carried on without a reasonable expectation of profit by an individual, a personal trust or a partnership, all of the members of which are individuals), except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person,\n(b) an adventure or concern of the person in the nature of trade (other than an adventure or concern engaged in without a reasonable expectation of profit by an individual, personal trust or a partnership, all of the members of which are individuals), except to the extent to which the adventure or concern involves the making of exempt supplies by the person, and\n(c) the making of a supply (other than an exempt supply) by the person of real property of the person, including anything done by the person in the course of or in connection with the making of the supply.\n[Emphasis added are my own.]\n[10] The definition of a \u201cbusiness\u201d is found in subsection 123(1) of the Act and reads as follows:\n\u201cbusiness\u201d includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit, and any activity engaged in on a regular or continuous basis that involves the supply of property by way of lease, license or similar arrangement, but does not include an office or employment.\n[Emphasis added are my own.]\n[11] The use of the word \u201cincludes\u201d means that the definition of a business is not exhaustive. The determination of what constitutes the carrying on of a business in the course of a commercial activity is an inherently factual determination. That is why the Act does not have a comprehensive definition of what constitutes a business. What constitutes a concern or adventure in the nature of a trade is undefined in the Act for a similar reason. Parliament has left it up to the courts to identify the relevant factors to identify whether a business or a concern or adventure in the nature of a trade exists or not.\n[12] Parliament has adopted the same approach under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d) for the purpose of determining whether a business is carried on as a source of income. The definition of a business uses the word \u201cincludes\u201d which implies that the definition is not exhaustive.[4] Subsection 9(1) of the ITA provides that a taxpayer\u2019s income from a business is the taxpayer\u2019s profit from the business for the year. Similarly, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA provides that an outlay or expense can only be deducted, to the extent that, it was made or incurred for the purpose of earning income. Since the concept of a \u201cbusiness\u201d is not exhaustive, the Courts have identified a number of factors to be considered to determine whether actions or activities that have a personal element constitute the carrying on of a business for the purposes of subsection 9(1) and paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA. These factors are applied in most cases when activities are carried on directly by an individual. As a general rule, corporations are viewed as carrying on commercial activities. That said, owner shareholders often treat corporations as their alter ego. They have difficulty delineating personal expenses and personal activities from business expenses and business activities.\n[13] In Stewart v. Canada,[5] the Supreme Court of Canada (\u201cSCC\u201d) considered and set aside the concept of \u201ca reasonable expectation of profit\u201d[6] as a factor to consider in determining whether a business exists and expenses or losses are deductible against net sources of income. This concept was developed in Moldowan v R,[7] an earlier decision of the SCC. In Stewart, the SCC confirmed that the other factors identified in Moldowan should be considered in determining whether actions and activities that have a personal element constitute the carrying on of a business as a source of income for the purpose of the ITA.\n[14] The relevant factors for distinguishing elements of a personal nature from activities that are undertaken in the course of a business include: (1) the profit and loss experiences in past years; (2) the taxpayer\u2019s training; (3) the taxpayer\u2019s intended course of action; and (4) the capability of the venture to show a profit.[8] In Stewart, the SCC noted that those four factors are not exhaustive, and that the factors will differ with the nature and extent of the activities.\n[15] I will consider the factors noted above in the present case, because they are useful in determining whether the actions Mr. Christie claimed were personal activities of himself rather than commercial activities of the Appellant.\n[16] I have chosen to focus on Mr. Christie\u2019s actions and activities as he is the sole person who, allegedly, has acted on behalf of UPI. Undoubtedly, Mr. Christie\u2019s interest lies in the realm of music, film and audiovisual production and presentation and beyond. Persons can carry out these activities because they enjoy them. These same activities can also be undertaken in the context of a business carried on personally or through a corporation.\n[17] I recognize that a business can exist well before the time that revenue is earned. All businesses have a start\u2011up phase, which can be short or long, depending on the nature of the venture. Generally speaking, persons involved during the start\u2011up phase of a venture have a well thought\u2011out business plan, have identified the specific products or services that will be marketed and sold and have identified a target audience for their services and products. Similarly, they will undertake activities to finance their activities.\n[18] In disallowing the Appellant\u2019s ITC claims on the grounds that UPI had not carried on a commercial activity during the Relevant Periods, the Minister relied, inter alia, on the following assumptions of fact: (i) the Appellant had no target industry, clients or expectation of receiving any revenue; (ii) the Appellant took no steps to market a product for sale; and, (iii) the Appellant has not reported any income or expenses on its T2 income tax returns.[9]\n[19] The evidence presented by the Appellant falls well short of demonstrating that any of the aforementioned steps have been undertaken by Mr. Christie on behalf of the Appellant before and during the Relevant Period. In my opinion, Mr. Christie\u2019s actions and activities appear to lie within the personal realm. His actions, at best, amount to exploring how things of a personal interest to him may one day be carried on by UPI as a business.\n[20] I am also of the opinion that the expenses submitted by the Appellant in support of its ITCs are personal expenses of Mr. Christie.[10] The Minister assumed that this was the case in disallowing the Appellant\u2019s ITC claims.[11] The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the Minister\u2019s assumption of fact in this regard is incorrect. A registrant cannot claim ITCs in respect of the personal expense of its sole officer and shareholder.[12]\n[21] For all of these reasons, the Appellant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of January 2024.\n\u201cRobert J.

FACTS NOT AT ISSUE [1] Louis Zachary (the \u201cApplicant\u201d) is applying for an order for an extension of time to object under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1] for the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\n[2] The Applicant is a Registered Indian pursuant to section 2(1) of the Indian Act. He is a member of the Haudenosaunee Iroquois Confederacy located in the Mohawk Territory of the Haudenosaunee Territory.\n[3] On June 4, 2015, the Minister assessed the Applicant\u2019s 2014 taxation year and issued a notice of assessment (the \u201c2014 Assessment\u201d).[2]\n[4] On October 16, 2019, the Applicant filed a notice of objection in respect to the 2014 Assessment (the \u201c2014 Objection\u201d), over four years after the 2014 Assessment was issued.[3]\n[5] On November 26, 2019, the Minister wrote a letter to the Applicant stating that the 2014 Objection was filed late, and pursuant to paragraph 166.1(7) of the Act, their objection could not be granted or accepted.[4]\n[6] On January 20, 2020, the Applicant filed this application for an extension of time to file notices of objection for the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years (the \u201cExtension Application\u201d).[5]\nII. ISSUES [7] Do the procedural requirements in order to object to an assessment, as set out in the Act, apply to the Applicant? If they do, am I able to grant the Extension Application?\nIII. THE APPLICANT\u2019S POSITION [8] The Applicant claims he paid income taxes in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He states that this tax was paid in error and thus he should be entitled to a refund.[6]\n[9] The Applicant appears to be making two main arguments. The first argument being that, pursuant to section 35 of the Constitution Act[7], the Act is not applicable to him (neither requiring him to pay income tax, nor to be bound by the provisions of the Act concerning the filing of an objection to an assessment).\n[10] The Applicant also argues that Treaty Indians are not citizens nor residents of Canada and thus he is not required to pay income tax.[8] In aid of this argument, the Applicant references various treaties.[9]\nIV. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION [11] The Minister asserts that the Applicant\u2019s 2014 Objection was filed late.[10]\n[12] Furthermore, the Minister states that no objection was ever filed in relation to the 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years.[11]\n[13] On March 4, 2020, the Respondent submitted an affidavit from Theresa Chichmanian (the \u201cAffidavit\u201d), an Officer in the Montreal Tax Services Office of the CRA.[12]\n[14] The Affidavit states that one of the conditions to filing an application with the Court for an extension of time for serving notices of objection with respect to the Applicant\u2019s 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years has not been met pursuant to subsection 166.2 of the Act, as no objections were filed in those years.[13]\n[15] The Respondent takes issues with what he describes as the constitutional arguments raised by the Applicant. Specifically, the Respondent argues that the presence of a constitutional argument at the application stage is irrelevant, as the only question before the Court relates to the filing of the objection, whereas the merits of the constitutional arguments would be addressed in a subsequently filed notice of appeal.[14]\n[16] Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has not articulated their constitutional challenge, and absent the Applicant following the proper procedures for bringing a constitutional challenge, their constitutional argument cannot move forward.[15]\n[17] The Respondent argues that the Applicant must fully articulate the constitutional question, serve a Notice of Constitutional Question in accordance with subsection 57(1) of the Federal Courts Act[16], and ensure there is a full evidentiary record in respect of the identified question. The Respondent argues the Applicant has not met any of these three criteria.[17]\nV. APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL ANALYSIS [18] In the following analysis, the term Indian is used, which is a subset of the term Aboriginal People, as it has legal meaning under the Indian Act[18] and the Constitution Act[19].\n[19] Indian is defined in section 2(1) of the Indian Act.\nIndian means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian;\n[20] Section 35(2) of the Constitution Act reads:\n35(2) Definition of \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\"\nIn this Act, \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\" includes the Indian, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada.\n[21] The Applicant argues that as a Registered Indian, he is not a citizen nor a resident of Canada, and therefore the procedural requirements under the Act are not applicable to him.[20]\n[22] It must be noted that the representative for the Applicant, during hearings on November 22, 2022, and June 26, 2023, stated the Applicant was not making a constitutional challenge. The Applicant states at paragraph (D) of the Notice of Appeal that:\nThe Income Tax Act applies to Canadian Residents, not Hausdenoshaune Iroquois Confederacy Treaty Indians. Mr. Louis Zachery is not Canadian Resident or United States Citizen therefore, he is exempt from paying Income Tax.\n[23] Although the Applicant states that he is not advancing a constitutional question, the thrust of what he is asserting in at least one of his arguments is that subsection 35(1) of the Constitution Act exempts him from paying income tax under the Act, and further the application of the Act as a whole is inapplicable to him. Although not formulated as a constitutional question, what the Applicant is challenging in this hearing is the applicability of sections 166.1 and 166.2 of the Act to Registered Indians, based on subsection 35(1) of the Constitution Act.\n[24] In Thompson v. MNR[21], Justice Trudel of the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the need for a notice of constitutional question is linked to the remedy sought by a party. If an applicant does not seek a finding that the provisions of an act are invalid, inapplicable, or inoperative, then no notice is required.\n67 The need for a notice of constitutional question is linked to the remedy sought by a party: Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2004 FCA 66, [2004] 3 F.C.R. 436 (F.C.A.). Section 57 of the Federal Courts Act states that the constitutional validity, applicability, or operability of an Act of Parliament shall not be judged unless notice has been served. Neither in his Notice of Appeal nor in the Order Sought section of his memorandum of fact and law does the appellant seek a finding that the provisions of the Act under which the Minister acted in this case are invalid, inapplicable or inoperable as required by section 57. As a result, it is not necessary to address the question raised in the notice of constitutional question.\n[25] Based upon the above analysis, it is clear that at least part of the Applicant\u2019s argument comes by way of advancing a Constitutional question. Specifically, the Applicant is arguing that the provisions of the Act are inapplicable to him as a Status Indian. I must therefore determine whether the Applicant has met the requirements to make such an argument to the Court.\n[26] In order to advance a Constitutional question, the Applicant must have filed a Notice of Constitutional Question pursuant to section 19.2 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, RSC 1985 c T-2. This Notice must clearly identify the Constitutional question in issue. This has not been done. Therefore I will not rule upon the Constitutional question. Even if I were to allow the Constitutional argument to proceed, there is no evidence before the Court that supports the argument.\nA. Citizens and Residents of Canada\n[27] The Applicant\u2019s second argument is that Treaty Indians are not citizens of Canada, and as such he does not have to pay taxes.\n[28] In considering this argument, the first question that must be answered is whether Status Indians are citizens of Canada[22].\n[29] In Mitchell v. MNR[23], the respondent was a Mohwak of Akwesasne and descendant of the Mohawk Nation. The respondent had crossed the Canada\/US border and refused to pay custom tax, arguing that an aboriginal right existed that exempted him from paying duty. Then Supreme Court Chief Justice McLachlin discussed the history of aboriginal people in Canada and the entrenchment of their rights in the Constitution Act.\n9. Long before Europeans explored and settled North America, aboriginal peoples were occupying and using most of this vast expanse of land in organized, distinctive societies with their own social and political structures. The part of North America we now call Canada was first settled by the French and the British who, from the first days of exploration, claimed sovereignty over the land on behalf of their nations. English law, which ultimately came to govern aboriginal rights, accepted that the aboriginal peoples possessed pre-existing laws and interests, and recognized their continuance in the absence of extinguishment, by cession, conquest, or legislation: see, e.g., the Royal Proclamation, 1763, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1, and R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075 (S.C.C.), at p. 1103. At the same time, however, the Crown asserted that sovereignty over the land, and ownership of its underlying title, vested in the Crown: Sparrow, supra. With this assertion arose an obligation to treat aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and to protect them from exploitation, a duty characterized as \"fiduciary\" in Guerin v. R., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 (S.C.C.).\n10. Accordingly, European settlement did not terminate the interests of aboriginal peoples arising from their historical occupation and use of the land. To the contrary, aboriginal interests and customary laws were presumed to survive the assertion of sovereignty, and were absorbed into the common law as rights, unless (1) they were incompatible with the Crown's assertion of sovereignty, (2) they were surrendered voluntarily via the treaty process, or (3) the government extinguished them: see B. Slattery, \"Understanding Aboriginal Rights\" (1987), 66 Can. Bar Rev. 727. Barring one of these exceptions, the practices, customs and traditions that defined the various aboriginal societies as distinctive cultures continued as part of the law of Canada: see Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1973] S.C.R. 313 (S.C.C.), and Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2) (1992), 175 C.L.R. 1 (Australia H.C.), at p. 57 (per Brennan J.), pp. 81-82 (per Deane and Gaudron JJ.), and pp. 182-83 (per Toohey J.).\n11. The common law status of aboriginal rights rendered them vulnerable to unilateral extinguishment, and thus they were \"dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign\": see St. Catharines Milling & Lumber Co. v. R. (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46 (Canada P.C.), at p. 54. This situation changed in 1982, when Canada's constitution was amended to entrench existing aboriginal and treaty rights: Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35(1). The enactment of s. 35(1) elevated existing common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status (although, it is important to note, the protection offered by s. 35(1) also extends beyond the aboriginal rights recognized at common law: Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 (S.C.C.), at para. 136). Henceforward, aboriginal rights falling within the constitutional protection of s. 35 could not be unilaterally abrogated by the government. However, the government retained the jurisdiction to limit aboriginal rights for justifiable reasons, in the pursuit of substantial and compelling public objectives: see R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723 (S.C.C.), and Delgamuukw, supra.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[30] Grand Chief Mitchell\u2019s claim of an aboriginal right was dismissed, as the Supreme Court found that he had not shown the right existed. Justice Binnie, concurring in result, went on to quote Justice Dickson (as he then was) and state that Indians are citizens of Canada, subject to all the responsibilities of other Canadian citizens.\n132 [\u2026] In other respects however, the respondent and other aboriginal people live and contribute as part of our national diversity. So too in the Court's definition of aboriginal rights. They find their source in an earlier age, but they have not been frozen in time. They are, as has been said, rights not relics. They are projected into modern Canada where they are exercised as group rights in the 21st century by modern Canadians who wish to preserve and protect their aboriginal identity.\n133 In the earlier years of the century the federal government occasionally argued that Parliament's jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 (\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\") was plenary. Indians were said to be federal people whose lives were wholly subject to federal \"regulation\". This was rejected by the courts, which ruled that while an aboriginal person could be characterized as an Indian for some purposes including language, culture and the exercise of traditional rights, he or she does not cease thereby to be a resident of a province or territory. For other purposes he or she must be recognized and treated as an ordinary member of Canadian society. In a decision handed down soon after the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982, Nowegijick v. R., [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29 (S.C.C.), a tax case, Dickson J. (as he then was) wrote at p. 36,\" Indians are citizens and, in affairs of life not governed by treaties or the Indian Act, they are subject to all of the responsibilities of other Canadian citizens\".

In Gladstone (at para. 73) and again in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 (S.C.C.) (at para. 165), Lamer C.J. repeats that \"distinctive aboriginal societies exist within, and are a part of, a broader social, political and economic community, over which the Crown is sovereign\" (emphasis added). The constitutional objective is reconciliation not mutual isolation.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[31] The Applicant\u2019s argument that he is not a citizen of Canada must fail.\nB. Subject to Procedural Requirements\n[32] The next question is, as a citizen of Canada, is the Applicant subject to the procedural requirements under the Act? This must be answered in the affirmative.\n[33] The scenario before the Court is almost on all fours with the decision in Horseman,[24] in which the Applicant was seeking an extension of time to appeal a GST assessment where the request was made outside of the statutorily mandated timelines. The Applicant also sought to raise constitutional arguments.\n[34] The Court in that instance had to decide whether the Act\u2019s prerequisite provisions for filing of a notice of appeal, including temporal and procedural limitations, applied notwithstanding that the prospective Applicant\u2019s intended argument was that the Act was unconstitutional in its application to Indians. The application was denied on the basis that the Applicant had not fulfilled the prerequisite provisions for filing a notice of appeal, regardless of the prospective argument of the appeal being based on constitutional grounds.\n[35] On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Russel\u2019s decision and stated that procedural provisions apply and must be obeyed even where the constitutional rights and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples are asserted.[25]\n3. In dismissing the appellant's application, the Tax Court found (at para. 37) that the appellant had not filed a valid objection to the assessment, a statutory prerequisite for an appeal to the Court, and was now out of time. Further, the Tax Court held (at para. 24) that the provisions of the Act concerning objections and appeals apply even where a person intends to raise arguments based on the constitutional rights of Indigenous peoples. In this regard, the Tax Court emphasized (at para. 23) that the appellant was making \"a private claim [...], seeking monetary relief in respect of his personal tax situation.\" The appellant appeals to this Court.\n4. In our view, the appeal must fail. In private, personal claims such as this, procedural and jurisdictional provisions apply and must be obeyed even where the constitutional rights and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples are asserted: Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245; Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman, 2008 SCC 14[2008] 1 S.C.R. 372 at para. 13; Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14[2013] 1 S.C.R. 623 at para. 134. This case law is a subset of a larger body of case law requiring that those asserting personal, private claims founded upon constitutional rights must still comply with statutory limitation periods and other procedural and jurisdictional requirements: see, e.g., R. v. Mills, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863 (S.C.C.) at page 953; Ravndahl v. Saskatchewan, 2009 SCC 7, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 181 ; St-Onge c. R., 2001 FCA 308, 288 N.R. 3; Newman v. R., 2016 FCA 213, 406 D.L.R. (4th) 602 and the many cases cited therein.\n5. The appellant notes that the exemption from taxation contained in subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 opens with the words \"[n]otwithstanding any other Act of Parliament...\". He submits that this means that the procedural and jurisdictional requirements in the Excise Tax Act do not apply.\n6. We disagree. The opening words of section 87 prevent other Acts of Parliament imposing taxes contrary to the substantive exemption granted by section 87. They do not displace procedural and jurisdictional requirements such as where, when and how a proceeding is to be brought. Were it otherwise, what would stop a person from going directly to the Supreme Court of Canada at any time, perhaps a decade or more later, to claim the section 87 exemption at first instance?\n7. The Tax Court was correct in concluding that the application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal must be dismissed. The Tax Court has jurisdiction over such an application only where the requirements of the Excise Tax Act, above, ss. 301-307 are met, including the requirement that a valid notice of objection be filed: Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, s. 12. One was not filed here.\n8. We see no reviewable error in the Tax Court's findings of fact and substantially agree with the legal analysis of the Tax Court as it pertains to those facts (at paras. 25-42).\n[Emphasis added.]\n[36] Therefore, in order to be successful in this Application, Mr. Zachary must have met the procedural requirements of the Act, concerning the filing of a Notice of Objection. This is considered below.\nC. Extension Application\n[37] I must now determine whether to accept this Extension Application and thus allow the Applicant to file his various objections past the normal 90-day objection period.\n[38] Subsection 165(1) of the Act reads as follows:\n165 (1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual (other than a trust) or a graduated rate estate for the year, on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; and\n(b) in any other case, on or before the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[39] The Applicant did not meet the 90-day objection period. The notice of assessment for the 2014 taxation year was dated June 4, 2015. The Applicant objected to the 2014 taxation year on October 16, 2019, 1,596 days later.\n[40] The Applicant, if he wished to object to the 2014 taxation year, must then have filed a section 166.1 application with the Minister requesting an extension of time to file an objection.\nExtension of time by Minister\n166.1 (1) Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165, nor any request under subsection 245(6) made, within the time limited by those provisions for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection or making the request.\n[41] This application must be filed within one-year after the 90-day objection period. Unfortunately, the Applicant did not do this.\n(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[42] After requesting an extension from the Minister, a taxpayer may request the Tax Court of Canada to grant the application using section 166.2. A pre-condition to making a section 166.2 extension application is that a taxpayer must have filed a section 166.1 extension application with the Minister. This was not done.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2 (1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\nThis application, like the section 166.1 application to the Minister, must be made within one-year after the 90-day objection period.\n(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[43] If no application was filed with the Minister under section 166.1, an application to the Tax Court of Canada under section 166.2 is invalid.[26]\n[44] Furthermore, if a taxpayer misses the 90-day deadline to apply to the Tax Court of Canada after the Minister rejects a section 166.1 application, the Tax Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to hear the application.[27]Therefore, the request for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection for the 2014 taxation year must be denied.\n[45] For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years, no notices of objections were ever filed by the Applicant. No requests for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection were ever filed either. Therefore I must deny the application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection for these years as well.\nVI. CONCLUSION [46] Mr. Zachary is citizen of Canada, and therefore, any argument that the Act or its procedural provisions are not applicable to him must fail.\n[47] This Court cannot grant the Applicant\u2019s Extension Application as it does not meet the procedural requirements under the Act, namely that it be filed within the statutory timelines as well as having followed the correct extension procedure.\n[48] The Application is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 23rd day of January 2024.\n\u201cR.

Introduction [1] Maria Csak (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals an assessment in the amount of $1,200,000 made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under section 160 of the Income Tax Act[1] (the \u201cITA\u201d) by notice dated August 14, 2012 (the \u201cAssessment\u201d).\n[2] The basis of the Assessment is that the Appellant\u2019s deceased spouse, Charles Csak (\u201cCC\u201d), transferred a property to the Appellant having a fair market value of $1,200,000 at a time when CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 through 1991 taxation years totalled $536,625 plus accrued interest.[2] The Appellant married CC in October 1992, the transfer of property occurred on January 8, 1993 and CC passed away on March 9, 2002.\nII. The Facts A. The Minister\u2019s Assumptions of Fact [3] In determining the Appellant\u2019s liability pursuant to subsection 160(1) of the ITA, the Minister made the following assumptions of fact:\na) On January 8, 1993, Charles Csak transferred [a property located at 7286 Tenth Line, Mississauga, Ontario (the \u201cProperty\u201d)] [3] to the Appellant;\nb) The Appellant and Charles Csak were married as at [January 8, 1993];\nc) No consideration passed from the Appellant to Charles Csak in connection with the transfer of the Property as the transfer was for \u201cnatural love and affection\u201d;\nd) The fair market value of the Property as at [January 8, 1993] was $1,200,000;\ne) Charles Csak died on or about March 9, 2002;\nf) After the death of Charles Csak, the Appellant was executrix and\/or trustee of his estate;\ng) As at August 14, 2012, the Estate of the Late Charles Csak\u2019s unpaid tax liability under the [Income Tax Act], Income Tax Act (Ontario), including interest, in respect of taxation years prior to [January 8, 1993], was as follows;[4]\nThe Underlying Assessments\nh) Charles Csak was reassessed for the 1988, 1989, 1990 taxation years on April 21, 1994; and reassessed for the 1991 taxation year on August 15, 1994 (the \u201cUnderlying Assessments\u201d);\ni) The Underlying Assessments concerned partnership losses claimed by Charles Csak which were disallowed by the Minister;\nj) In 1996, Charles Csak, along with other persons involved in the same partnership(s), filed an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada from the Underlying Assessments;\nk) The Appellant as executrix and\/or trustee of Charles Csak\u2019s estate pursued and directed the appeal to the Tax Court of Canada following his death;\nl) [Withdrawn by counsel for the Respondent at the hearing of the appeal];\nm) The Appellant was a beneficiary of the Estate of the Late Charles Csak;\nn) On July 13, 2006, Chief Justice Bowman of [sic] Tax Court of Canada issued judgment dismissing the Estate of the Late Charles Csak\u2019s appeal of the Underlying Assessments;\no) The tax liability of the Estate of the Late Charles Csak of $4,876,825 remains outstanding;\nThe Waivers\np) Charles Csak executed a waiver of the normal reassessment period for the 1988 taxation year on September 10, 1992, which was mailed to the Minister on September 11, 1992, and received on September 14, 1992; and\nq) Charles Csak executed a waiver of the normal reassessment period for the 1989 taxation year on May 27, 1993, which was mailed to the Minister on May 27, 1993, and received on May 31, 1993.[5]\nB. Facts Admitted in the Pleadings [4] In paragraph 1 of the Amended Reply, the Respondent admits the facts stated in paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Notice of Appeal, which state:\n14. Charles was originally assessed for the 1988 to 1991 tax years on the following dates:\n(a) September 20, 1989 (Re: 1988).\n(b) May 30, 1990 (Re: 1989).\n(c) November 8, 1991 (Re: 1990).\n(d) October 9, 1992 (Re: 1991).\n15. The CRA reassessed Charles for the years 1988 to 1991 on the following dates (collectively, the \u201cUnderlying Transferor Reassessments\u201d):\n(a) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1988) (the \u201c1988 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(b) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1989) (the \u201c1989 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(c) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1990) (the \u201c1990 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(d) August 15, 1994 (Re: 1991) (the \u201c1991 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n[5] In paragraph 3 of the Amended Reply, the Respondent admits that CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years were reassessed by the 1988 Transferor Reassessment and the 1989 Transferor Reassessment after the normal reassessment period for those taxation years. I will refer to the 1988 Transferor Reassessment and the 1989 Transferor Reassessment, collectively, as the \u201cDisputed CC Reassessments\u201d.\nC. The Partial Agreed Statement of Facts [6] The parties submitted a partial agreed statement of facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d) together with the documents referred to in the PASF (the \u201cJoint Book\u201d). A copy of the PASF is attached to these reasons as Appendix A.\n[7] The parties agree that the fair market value of the Property at the time of the transfer of the Property on January 8, 1993 was $950,000. The parties also agree that the normal reassessment periods for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years expired on September 20, 1992 and May 30, 1993, respectively.\nD. The Evidence of the Witnesses [8] The Appellant testified on her own behalf.\n[9] The Respondent called two witnesses:\nA. Mr. Azharul Hassan, currently a team leader in revenue collections at the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) and formerly a collections officer at the CRA; and\nB. Mr. John Hussey, currently the Assistant Director of Administration for the Greater Toronto Area at the CRA.\n[10] I found all of the witnesses to be credible.\n[11] The Appellant testified that she disagreed with the assumptions of fact stated in paragraphs 11(c), (k) and (m) of the Amended Reply.\n[12] With respect to paragraph 11(c) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant testified that she had given consideration for the Property consisting of her agreement to marry CC and her agreement to care for CC. The Appellant described her agreement to marry CC as the more serious consideration for her.\n[13] Regarding the agreement to marry, the Appellant explained that she had planned to marry CC in 1988 or 1989, but that CC had married another woman (the \u201cFormer CC Spouse\u201d) in July 1989 without the Appellant\u2019s knowledge.\n[14] The Former CC Spouse left CC after a couple of days and moved to Europe. This turn of events soured the Appellant\u2019s relationship with CC for a few months, but the relationship resumed in late 1989.\n[15] CC obtained a divorce from the Former CC Spouse around 1991. However, the Appellant had lingering concerns that CC might \u201cdouble cross\u201d her again and that the Former CC Spouse would return and make a claim over CC\u2019s home (i.e., the Property). The Appellant advised CC that she would not marry him unless he transferred his home to her.\n[16] The Appellant and CC were married in October 1992 and the Property was transferred to the Appellant on January 8, 1993. In cross-examination, the Appellant stated that she and CC had not entered into a written agreement regarding the Property other than the documents required to transfer the Property from CC to the Appellant.\n[17] Regarding the agreement to care for CC, the Appellant testified that CC, who was close to 80 years old when they married, had several serious ailments and that caring for CC was a 24\/7 undertaking.\n[18] In cross-examination, the Appellant conceded that she had continued to work during her marriage to CC\u2014noting that she had flexible work hours\u2014and that she had no education or training relevant to the personal care of an individual. The Appellant had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: Okay. So what I understand from you, and you can just answer yes or no, is that it was only after the fact when you looked back on all of what you had done that you realized how much time and energy you had put into the caregiving services that you provided. Is that accurate?\nMS. CSAK: Yes, because you don\u2019t know what the future can bring, yeah.[6]\n[19] Counsel for the Respondent took the Appellant through a copy of an Affidavit of Residence and Value of Consideration (the \u201cAffidavit\u201d) and a Transfer\/Deed of Land (the \u201cDeed\u201d) respecting the Property, both of which are included in tab 3 of the Joint Book.\n[20] The Appellant conceded that she had signed the Affidavit, that it stated in section 4 that the total consideration for the Property was nil and that it stated in section 7 that:\nThis is a transfer for natural love and affection from husband to wife and there is no consideration therefore no land transfer tax is exigible.\n[21] The Appellant identified the signatures in sections 8 and 9 of the Deed as those of CC and herself, respectively.\n[22] With respect to paragraph 11(m) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant testified in chief that she had received nothing from the estate of CC. In cross\u2011examination, the Appellant acknowledged that she was the executrix and a beneficiary of CC\u2019s estate but reiterated that she had received nothing from CC\u2019s estate.\n[23] The Appellant also acknowledged that she had a duty to act in the best interests of the estate, stating that she had tried to do that by, among other things, paying $382,000 to the CRA.\n[24] With respect to paragraph 11(k) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant had the following exchange with her counsel:\nMR. BUOTE: \u2026 Do you agree that you pursued and directed the appeal to the Tax Court of Canada following Charlie\u2019s death?\nMS. CSAK: Absolutely not. I only signed the cheque and I didn\u2019t understand the case and I left everything for lawyers.[7]\n[25] In cross-examination, the Appellant had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: And you were aware of the tax appeal before Charlie passed away.\nMS. CSAK: Not -- not really.\nMS. MAHADEO: No.\nMS. CSAK: Not really. I only knew something was -- something is going on, but then only said don\u2019t worry, everything -- we only ask it was why we are even need a lawyer, the first one. And that one only said don\u2019t worry, everything was prepared by law and only once did -- after the meeting we ask this -- this lawyer why we are here. There was something wrong prepare it? And the lawyer said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be straightening up\u201d. That\u2019s it.\nAnd that only said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything was prepared by law\u201d.\nThis what we knew it. There was -- it was last year before he was alive. This what we already knew it. But we even didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.[8]\n[26] When counsel asked about the meeting mentioned in this exchange, the Appellant stated:\nThere was a few people because I know that was some parts of this, you know. There was a list of the names of the part of this, you know. And he was one of the name.\nCharlie or me, we didn\u2019t know this -- these people. We didn\u2019t know who is who. Only we knew the name and there was like (inaudible) defence lawyer and there was very briefly. And after the meeting, we only ask why we are here, why we need a lawyer.[9]\n[27] The Appellant testified that after CC passed away, she would deliver cheques to an accountant who was an appellant in the same group appeal. The accountant told her that the lawyer could not meet with all the members of the group, and the Appellant testified that she did not meet with the lawyer or receive updates from the lawyer at any time.\n[28] Counsel for the Appellant acknowledged that the Appellant had been subject to written examination for discovery in CC\u2019s appeal and that CC had not raised the statute-barred issue in his appeal. The Appellant then had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: You also did not raise the validity of the underlying assessments in Charlie\u2019s tax appeal; correct?\nMS. CSAK: I was not involved anything. I just make the cheque. I don\u2019t understand the whole ---[10]\n[29] With respect to the waivers for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cWaivers\u201d and, individually, the \u201c1988 Waiver\u201d and the \u201c1989 Waiver\u201d), the Appellant testified that she was 80% certain that the signature on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s signature and that she was 80% certain that the signature on the 1989 Waiver was CC\u2019s signature. The Appellant stated that she had witnessed CC signing cheques quite often over the years.\n[30] The Appellant made two comments regarding the handwritten address on the 1988 Waiver. First, CC came to Canada from Hungary when he was in his fifties and he did not have a sufficient command of the English language to handwrite his address. Second, the person who made the handwritten correction crossed out CC\u2019s correct address and added the wrong address. In contrast, CC\u2019s address on the 1989 Waiver is typed and is correct.\n[31] The copies of the Waivers submitted by the Appellant[11] each had a stamp stating \u201cDISCLOSED PURSUANT TO THE PA\u201d.\n[32] The Appellant did not know who prepared the Waivers. The copy of the 1988 Waiver submitted by the Appellant was not stamped by Revenue Canada.[12] The copy of the 1989 Waiver submitted by the Appellant has a stamp in the area reserved for departmental use stating that it was delivered by hand and was received by the Revenue Canada mailroom on May 31, 1993.[13]\n[33] The Respondent submitted a copy of the 1988 Waiver together with a copy of a letter from Barry Witkin, C.A., C.B.V., of BDO Dunwoody Ward Mallette addressed to Mr. Derek Potopsingh at the Mississauga District Office of Revenue Canada.[14] The copy of the 1988 Waiver included with exhibit R-1 is identical to the copy included in exhibit A-1 except that it does not have the Privacy Act stamp. The Respondent did not submit a copy of the 1989 Waiver without the Privacy Act stamp but instead relied on exhibit A-2.\n[34] The letter included in exhibit R-1 is dated September 11, 1992 and has a stamp stating that it was received by Revenue Canada Taxation in Mississauga on September 14, 1992. The letter does not have any indication of an enclosure with the letter (i.e., there is no \u201cEncl.\u201d or \u201cEnc.\u201d under the signature line; only the initials \u201c:ag\u201d). The letter states:\nRe: Charles Csak & Howard Deverett\nAt the request of John Campbell of Miller Thomson, I have arranged for the waivers for the above named clients to be signed so that the discussion with Mr. Campbell and yourself regarding the matter of Claridge Holdings # 1 can continue. I trust this is what you require.\nIf you have any questions concerning the above, please contact the writer.\nPlease note the change of address of each client.\n[35] Mr. Hassan testified that he found the letter and the 1988 Waiver in CC\u2019s physical file when, as a collections officer, he was assigned the file in 2019. In cross-examination, Mr. Hassan acknowledged that there was no indication on exhibit R-1 that the letter and the waiver had been stapled together.\n[36] Counsel for the Respondent took Mr. Hassan to exhibit A-2, which is a copy of the 1989 Waiver with a Privacy Act stamp. Mr. Hassan then had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: Have you seen this document before?\nMR. HASSAN: I believe I did.\nMS. MAHADEO: And where do you believe you saw this document?\nMR. HASSAN: It would also have been in the physical document.\n\u2026\nMS. MAHADEO: And you said you believe you saw this in the file. So the -- was the waiver in the file when you assumed carriage of it?\nMR. HASSAN: This waiver?\nMS. MAHADEO: Yes.\nMR. HASSAN: I believe so.[15]\n[37] With respect to the Revenue Canada \u201creceived\u201d stamp on the letter, Mr. Hussey testified that it was CRA mailroom policy to stamp only the first page of a multi-page document. In cross-examination, Mr. Hussey was asked why, given the importance of the date of a waiver, the CRA would not stamp a waiver when it is accompanied by a letter. Mr. Hussey responded:\nMR. HUSSEY: I didn\u2019t write the policy, but my speculation would be that the people who work for me in the mail room are not tax auditors. They wouldn\u2019t know if the first page was more important than the last page, so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why our policy says to stamp the first page.\nAnd again, we could have a -- we could have a document this thick.\nWe receive 1,000 pieces of mail a day. We don\u2019t have time to go through it. So stamp the first one, move on to the next one.\nAgain, primarily I think it\u2019s because the guys wouldn\u2019t know if -- what that waiver is.[16]\n[38] With respect to the 1989 Waiver, in cross-examination, Mr. Hussey testified that if the 1989 Waiver had been mailed to Revenue Canada through Canada Post, then it \u201cshould not\u201d have ended up with a delivered-by-hand stamp.[17] Mr. Hussey also confirmed that the CRA\u2019s mailroom practices were consistent across Canada.\nE. Judicial Notice of Facts That Are a Matter of Public Record [39] The judgment and reasons for judgment of Bowman C.J. in CC\u2019s appeal were issued on July 12, 2006 under the citation Makuz v. R.[18] The style of cause names 16 appellants including CC, but does not name the estate of CC. The Court file numbers indicate that the appeals of the 16 appellants (collectively, the \u201cGroup\u201d) were filed in 1996 and 1997. The Court file number for CC\u2019s appeal indicates that it was filed in 1996, which the Minister assumes as a fact.\n[40] In paragraph 4 of his reasons, Bowman C.J. describes the issue in the appeals by the Group (the \u201cGroup Appeals\u201d) as follows:\nThe issue in all of the appeals is the same for all of the appellants. It is whether a loss in a partnership, in which the appellants claimed to have an interest, is deductible by the appellants in computing their income in the years 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991. \u2026\n[41] In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his reasons, Bowman C.J. states:\nThe facts are complicated and they include a multiplicity of transactions. A number of corporations and three partnerships are involved. \u2026\n\u2026\nIn a nutshell, here is the problem. Partnership A had a fiscal period ending December 31, 1987. Partnership B had a fiscal period ending March 31, 1988. Partnership B acquired a partnership interest in Partnership A on December 31, 1987. Partnership A sustained a loss before the end of its fiscal period that ended on December 31, 1987. Therefore, Partnership B\u2019s share of that loss should enter into the computation of its income or loss for the period ending March 31, 1988. The appellants\u2019 position is that they acquired partnership interests in Partnership B before March 31, 1988. Therefore they claimed their proportionate share of the loss of Partnership B.\n[42] I recognize that Bowman C.J.\u2019s statements are hearsay if entered for their truth. However, I am referring to them solely as an indication of Bowman C.J.\u2019s impressions regarding the Group Appeals.\n[43] Bowman C.J.\u2019s reasons comprise 76 paragraphs, and attached to the reasons as schedules A and B are a 33-paragraph agreement of certain facts and 15 slides describing the relevant transactions.\nIII. The Submissions of the Parties A. The Appellant [44] The Appellant submits that she has a right to challenge the reassessments of CC\u2019s 1988 through 1991 taxation years on which the Appellant\u2019s liability under section 160 is based: Joanne M. Gaucher v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2000 D.T.C. 6678 (FCA) (\u201cGaucher\u201d) at paragraphs 7 and 9.\n[45] The Respondent has conceded that the Disputed CC Reassessments were issued by the Minister after the expiration of the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years. The issue is whether, for each of those taxation years, the condition in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) was satisfied prior to the expiry of the normal reassessment period for the year.\n[46] The 1988 Waiver did not have a date stamp, and there is no evidence to establish that the letter included in exhibit R-1 was ever attached to the 1988 Waiver or included in an envelope with the 1988 Waiver.\n[47] The evidence of the Appellant is that the signature on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s signature, that the handwriting on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s handwriting and that the address for CC that was handwritten on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s address. The Appellant opined that CC would not sign the 1988 Waiver with the wrong address.[19]\n[48] The Minister initially assessed CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year on May 30, 1990. The stamp on the 1989 Waiver states that it was delivered by hand to Revenue Canada on May 31, 1993. This date is after the three-year normal reassessment period fixed by paragraph 152(3.1)(b) for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year.\n[49] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act[20] extends the time for \u201cthe doing of a thing\u201d. There is no time limit for filing a waiver and therefore no requirement to extend the time for filing a waiver. Consequently, section 26 of the Interpretation Act has no application to the filing of the 1989 Waiver.\n[50] In this case, the only \u201cthing\u201d that required extension is the period in which the Minister could reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year. However, the Minister did not reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year until April 21, 1994, so an extension of the deadline to reassess to May 31, 1993 was of no consequence.\n[51] With respect to consideration, the issue is not whether there was an enforceable contract between CC and the Appellant. The issue is whether consideration was given by the Appellant to CC for the Property. The evidence is that there was a quid pro quo\u2014CC transferred the Property to the Appellant in exchange for the Appellant agreeing to marry CC and to care for CC.\n[52] Finally, the parties agree that on September 19, 2003, the Appellant, as executrix of CC\u2019s estate, paid $382,377 on account of CC\u2019s tax liability for his 1988 taxation year.[21] The Appellant submits that there is no evidence that this payment reduced the balance owing for CC\u2019s 1988 taxation year. The Appellant asks the Court to direct that the payment be applied to reduce CC\u2019s balance owing for his 1988 taxation year.\nB. The Respondent [53] The Respondent submits that the Appellant did not provide any consideration to CC in exchange for the transfer of the Property to her. The Appellant confirmed that she did not provide to CC, at the time of the transfer of the Property, money paid or to be paid, mortgages assumed or given back to CC, property transferred in exchange for the Property, or other valuable consideration subject to land transfer tax.\n[54] The Appellant\u2019s evidence was that she did not enter into a written agreement with CC regarding care services. The Appellant had no training as a nurse or professional support worker. The Appellant did not agree to care for CC for a specified amount of time and did not identify the value of the services that she provided. The Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding care services was given based on hindsight rather than an agreement at the time of the transfer. The Appellant acknowledged that caring for CC was much more onerous than she had anticipated.\n[55] The case law does not support the conclusion that domestic services constitute consideration for the purposes of subsection 160(1): Macleod v. R., 2012 TCC 379 at paragraphs 33 to 37 and Raphael v. R., [2000] 4 C.T.C. 2620.\n[56] The case law holds that the onus falls on the Appellant to prove that the transfer of the Property was made pursuant to a genuine contractual arrangement: Konyi v. R., 2017 TCC 175 (\u201cKonyi\u201d) at paragraph 19. This requires the Appellant to establish all the essential terms of a contract, including specificity as to the consideration to be paid and the terms of payment: Konyi at paragraph 20 and Madsen v. R., 2005 TCC 110 at paragraph 28. The relevant time for determining the consideration is at the time that the Property is transferred: Hardtke v. R., 2015 TCC 135 at paragraph 33, affirmed 2016 FCA 138.\n[57] The principle in Gaucher does not apply to the Appellant. Gaucher contemplates a circumstance in which the taxpayer has no ability or right to challenge the validity of the underlying assessment. The Appellant was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate and therefore was a party to the litigation respecting the underlying reassessments and had the right to challenge the underlying reassessments.\n[58] The Appellant is precluded from challenging the Disputed CC Reassessments by the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process. The doctrine of res judicata has two commonly recognized branches: cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel.\n[59] In this case, the correctness of the Disputed CC Reassessments are has been decided. The parties to this appeal and to CC\u2019s appeal are the same or are in privity with one another. That is, either the Appellant was a party to CC\u2019s appeal by virtue of being the executrix of CC\u2019s estate, or the Appellant was in privity with CC\u2019s estate by virtue of that role. With respect to privity, counsel for the Respondent cites Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner & Keeler Ltd. (No. 2), [1967] 1 A.C. 853, Ethel Annabelle Angle v. Minister of National Revenue, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248, Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44 at paragraph 60 and Stallan v. Palleson, 2015 BCSC 1463 (\u201cStallan\u201d) at paragraph 30.\n[60] In the alternative, the doctrine of abuse of process applies to preclude the Appellant\u2019s challenge of the Disputed CC Reassessments. Given the Appellant\u2019s level of participation in the litigation of CC\u2019s appeal, including being the person legally controlling the proceedings on behalf of CC\u2019s estate, participating in discoveries as the estate\u2019s nominee in examination for discoveries, making litigation decisions, and receiving updates from the lead appellant, the principles of finality, consistency, and administration of justice support a conclusion that it is an abuse of process for the Appellant to challenge the Disputed CC Reassessments on the basis that they are statute-barred, when she failed to do so in the course of CC\u2019s appeal.\n[61] In the further alternative, the Disputed CC Reassessments are valid because CC filed waivers in respect of the normal reassessment periods for his 1988 and 1989 taxation years.\n[62] The Appellant did not allege in her notice of appeal or at discovery that she disputed the authenticity of the signature in the 1988 Waiver; therefore, she is precluded from doing so at the hearing of this appeal. The Appellant failed to call the author of the letter in the CRA\u2019s physical file, and the evidence of the Appellant alone is not sufficient to find that CC did not sign the 1988 Waiver.\n[63] The evidence establishes that the 1988 Waiver was filed on September 14, 1992 and that the 1989 Waiver was filed on May 31, 1993. Because May 30, 1993 was a Sunday, the deadline for filing the 1989 Waiver was extended to May 31, 1993 by section 26 of the Interpretation Act.\n[64] Under paragraph 160(1)(e), the Assessment properly included interest accrued on the liability of CC under the ITA to August 14, 2012: 1455257 Ontario Inc. v. R., 2021 FCA 142 at paragraphs 44 to 50.\n[65] There is no dispute that a payment on account of CC\u2019s tax liability of $382,377 was made on or about September 19, 2003. Pursuant to section 224.1, this payment was applied by the Minister to reduce CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 taxation year.\n[66] However, subsection 160(3) does not apply to reduce the Appellant\u2019s liability for two reasons. First, the Appellant was not liable under section 160 at the time of the payment because she had not been assessed under section 160 at that time. Second, the payment was not on account of the Appellant\u2019s liability under section 160.\nIV. Analysis A. Overview of Subsection 160(1) [67] The version of subsection 160(1) in force at the time of the Assessment stated:\n(1) Tax liability re property transferred not at arm\u2019s length \u2014 Where a person has, on or after May 1, 1951, transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to\n(a) the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner,\n(b) a person who was under 18 years of age, or\n(c) a person with whom the person was not dealing at arm\u2019s length,\nthe following rules apply:\n(d) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay a part of the transferor\u2019s tax under this Part for each taxation year equal to the amount by which the tax for the year is greater than it would have been if it were not for the operation of sections 74 to 75.1 of this Act and section 74 of the Income Tax Act, chapter 148 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, in respect of any income from, or gain from the disposition of, the property so transferred or property substituted therefor, and\n(e) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the property at the time it was transferred exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property, and\n(ii) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this Act (including, for greater certainty, an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this section, regardless of whether the Minister has made an assessment under subsection (2) for that amount) in or in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year,\nbut nothing in this subsection limits the liability of the transferor under any other provision of this Act or of the transferee for the interest that the transferee is liable to pay under this Act on an assessment in respect of the amount that the transferee is liable to pay because of this subsection.[22]\n[68] In Eyeball Networks Inc. v. R.,[23] No\u00ebl C.J. summarizes the application and the purpose of subsection 160(1) as follows:\nSubsection 160(1) provides that when a person transfers property to a non\u2011arm\u2019s length person, the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay any amount that the transferor was liable to pay under the Act for the taxation year in which the transfer occurred and any preceding years. Under paragraph 160(1)(e), the transferee\u2019s liability is limited to the excess of the fair market value of the property transferred over the fair market value of the consideration given for the property. ...\n...\nAs affirmed by this Court, the purpose of subsection 160(1) is to protect the tax authorities against any vulnerability that may result from a transfer of property between non-arm\u2019s length persons for a consideration that is less than the fair market value of the transferred property. ...[24]\n[69] I would add to this that it is also important to consider the comments of Rothstein J. in Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 26 at paragraph 75:\nThe Minister has numerous basis for challenging the deductions taken by a taxpayer. He may rely on sham or the general anti-avoidance rule to name just two. He did not do so in this case. In reassessment cases, the role of the court is solely to adjudicate disputes between the Minister and the taxpayer. It is not a protector of government revenue. The court must decide only whether the Minister, on the basis on which he chooses to assess, is right or wrong.\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[70] Accordingly, whether or not the Minister is otherwise able to collect the tax that the Minister says is owed by CC is not the issue. The issue is whether the assessment against the Appellant under subsection 160(1) is right or wrong.\n[71] Subsection 160(1) can be divided into two parts. The first part, which comprises the text before the mid-amble (i.e., before the words \u201cthe following rules apply\u201d), identifies the conditions that must be satisfied for the subsection to apply. The second part, which comprises the text after the mid-amble, describes the rules that apply when the conditions in the first part are satisfied.\n[72] On January 8, 1993, CC transferred the Property to the Appellant (the \u201cTransfer\u201d), who at the time of the Transfer was the spouse of CC. The Appellant accepts that the conditions stated in the first part of subsection 160(1) have been met.\n[73] The Appellant raises two defences relevant to the application of the second part of subsection 160(1) to the Appellant.\n[74] The first defence is that the Appellant paid consideration for the transfer of the Property in the form of an agreement to marry CC and an agreement to care for CC. The Appellant says that these agreements were a quid pro quo for the transfer of the Property.\n[75] The second defence is that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute-barred, and that CC had no liability under those reassessments for the purposes of determining the amount specified in subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii) in respect of CC.\nB. The Consideration Given by the Appellant for the Property [76] The value of consideration for a transfer of property is determined at the time of the transfer. At paragraph 52 of Eyeball Networks, No\u00ebl C.J. states:\n... a transfer of property takes place instantaneously both at civil and common law. The precise and clearly identifiable time when a transfer takes place under both legal systems is the notion that Parliament seized on in providing both that the value of the property is determined \u201cat the time it was transferred\u201d and the value of the consideration given is determined \u201cat that time\u201d. \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[77] The Appellant acknowledges that she did not have an agreement in writing with CC that addressed consideration for the transfer of the Property. In Ontario, subsection 1(1) of the Statute of Frauds[25] states:\n1 (1) Every estate or interest of freehold and every uncertain interest of, in, to or out of any messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments shall be made or created by a writing signed by the parties making or creating the same, or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized in writing, and, if not so made or created, has the force and effect of an estate at will only, and shall not be deemed or taken to have any other or greater force or effect.\n[78] The only pieces of evidence in writing relating to the transfer of the Property from CC to the Appellant are the Deed and the Affidavit, copies of which are at tab 3 of the Joint Book.\n[79] The Deed does not address the consideration for the transfer of the Property.\n[80] The Appellant testified that she signed the Affidavit. The Affidavit states that the Appellant paid nil consideration for the Property, and that the Transfer was for natural love and affection from husband to wife. The Appellant did not dispute the accuracy of the information stated in the Affidavit.\n[81] On the basis of the documentary evidence and the testimony of the Appellant in cross-examination regarding the Affidavit, I find that the Appellant gave no consideration for the Property. However, to be complete, I will address the specific consideration identified by the Appellant.\n[82] With respect to the agreement to marry, the Transfer occurred after the Appellant and CC were married. There is no evidence of a legally binding agreement between CC and the Appellant identifying marriage as consideration given by the Appellant for the Property, and there is no evidence of the fair market value of such a promise. A promise to marry that had already been fulfilled by the Appellant at the time of the Transfer cannot be consideration given by the Appellant for the Property at the time of the Transfer.\n[83] With respect to the agreement to care for CC, the Appellant\u2019s testimony indicates that it was only with hindsight that the Appellant ascertained the level of work involved in caring for CC. The Appellant continued to work outside the home after marrying CC and had no special training qualifying her to care for CC in a manner beyond the level of care that might be expected of any spouse. Further, there is no evidence of a legally binding agreement identifying future care of CC as consideration for the Property, and there is no evidence regarding the value of such future care.\n[84] I therefore conclude that the two promises identified by the Appellant were not consideration given by the Appellant for the Property at the time of the Transfer.\nC. The Disputed CC Reassessments (1) The Application of the Gaucher Principle [85] In Gaucher, the Minister assessed the appellant under section 160. Rothstein J.A. (as he then was) described the background as follows:\nThe appellant\u2019s former husband was assessed for approximately $350,000 of tax. The assessment was confirmed by the Tax Court of Canada. Shortly before the Tax Court confirmed the assessment, the appellant\u2019s former husband transferred a residence to her. A few months later, the former husband declared bankruptcy.[26]\n[86] The spouse challenged the assessment of her former husband on the ground that it was issued after the expiry of the normal reassessment period. The Tax Court judge denied the appellant\u2019s appeal. Rothstein J.A. overturned that decision, stating:\nI am of the respectful view that the Tax Court Judge was in error in coming to this conclusion. It is a basic rule of natural justice that, barring a statutory provision to the contrary, a person who is not a party to litigation cannot be bound by a judgment between other parties. The appellant was not a party to the reassessment proceedings between the Minister and her former husband. Those proceedings did not purport to impose any liability on her. While she may have been a witness in those proceedings, she was not a party, and hence could not in those proceedings raise defences to her former husband\u2019s assessment.\nWhen the Minister issues a derivative assessment under subsection 160(1), a special statutory provision is invoked entitling the Minister to seek payment from a second person for the tax assessed against the primary tax payer. That second person must have a full right of defence to challenge the assessment made against her, including an attack on the primary assessment on which the second person\u2019s assessment is based.[27]\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[87] More recently, in Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd., 2018 FCA 166 (\u201c594710\u201d), the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed the principle stated in Gaucher as follows:\nHoldco appealed the section 160 assessment to the Tax Court on several grounds, one of which was to deny that Partnerco had a tax liability. In an appeal of a section 160 assessment, Holdco is entitled to challenge the assessment issued to Partnerco on any grounds that would have been open to Partnerco if it had appealed directly (Gaucher v. R., 2000 D.T.C. 6678, [2001] 1 C.T.C. 125 (Fed. C.A.)).[28]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[88] The Respondent submits that the approach taken in Gaucher rests on the fact that the Appellant in that case was not a party to the underlying proceedings. The Respondent submits that the Appellant here was a party to CC\u2019s appeal in her capacity of executrix of CC\u2019s estate.\n[89] I do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Appellant\u2019s role in CC\u2019s appeal. The Appellant was not a party to CC\u2019s appeal and the estate of CC is not listed in the style of cause of Bowman C.J.\u2019s judgment and reasons.\n[90] Even if the estate of CC was a de facto party to CC\u2019s appeal by virtue of CC\u2019s death, the Appellant\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis CC\u2019s appeal was in her capacity as the personal representative of CC\u2019s estate.[29] To the extent that the Appellant had an interest in CC\u2019s appeal, it was in that representative capacity. Adopting Rothstein J.A.\u2019s observation in paragraph 6 of Gaucher, CC\u2019s appeal did not purport to impose liability on the Appellant even after she became the executrix of CC\u2019s estate.\n[91] As executrix of CC\u2019s estate, the Appellant owed a duty to the creditors and beneficiaries of CC\u2019s estate. Waters summarizes the task of the personal representative of a deceased individual:\nThe task of the personal representative of the deceased is to gather in the assets of the deceased, to discharge funeral and testamentary expenses and debts, and to distribute the remaining assets among the persons entitled.[30]\n[92] The Appellant testified that she did her best to fulfil her duty as executrix. I have no reason to question that statement.\n[93] CC\u2019s appeal was one of 16 appeals by the Group that were heard by Bowman C.J. at the same time on common evidence. The Group was represented by a lawyer, although it appears that the original lawyer was replaced prior to the hearing of the Group Appeals.[31]\n[94] Bowman C.J. stated in paragraph 6 of his reasons in Makuz that the \u201cfacts are complicated and they include a multiplicity of transactions.\u201d Bowman C.J. clearly did not view the subject matter of the Group Appeals as simple and straightforward.\n[95] The Appellant testified that she and CC attended one meeting at which the lawyer for the Group was present but they did not understand the nature of CC\u2019s appeal or the need for a lawyer. On the basis of the Appellant\u2019s testimony as a whole and Bowman C.J.\u2019s description of the subject matter of the Group Appeals, I find this to be quite plausible, if not highly likely.\n[96] The Appellant testified that, following CC\u2019s death, she gave cheques to another appellant in the Group, but she did not understand the nature of the appeal. I can identify no reason why the Appellant\u2019s understanding of CC\u2019s appeal would improve because she was named executrix of CC\u2019s estate. The Group was still represented by a lawyer, who it is reasonable to assume was directing the strategy employed in the Group Appeals.\n[97] The fact that the Appellant was subject to written discovery in CC\u2019s appeal is of no consequence. Presumably, this occurred because CC had passed away. There is no reason to believe that the Appellant had any material knowledge of the facts of CC\u2019s appeal given that CC\u2019s participation in the tax shelter commenced prior to March 31, 1988 and the Appellant and CC were not married until October 1992. In any event, being subject to discovery as the personal representative of CC\u2019s estate does not make the Appellant a party to CC\u2019s appeal.\n[98] Waivers were filed with Revenue Canada for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years. The letter submitted by the Respondent with the 1988 Waiver[32] states that signatures on the waiver for CC and one other individual were obtained at the request of a lawyer named in the letter so that discussions could continue regarding the subject matter of the Group Appeals. Consequently, the Group\u2019s lawyer must have been aware of the statute-barred issue for CC\u2019s 1988 taxation year.\n[99] Although there is no similar evidence in respect of the 1989 Waiver, the Appellant\u2019s evidence regarding CC\u2019s and the Appellant\u2019s minimal involvement in the Group Appeals suggests that any actions regarding a waiver for 1989 were instigated by the lawyer for the Group and that it is unlikely that either CC or the Appellant understood the nature of the issue.\n[100] The case law indicates that any statute-barred issue had to be raised in CC\u2019s notice of appeal; otherwise, the Respondent was not required to prove the existence of a valid waiver.[33] According to the court file numbers of the Group Appeals, the notices of appeal for the members of the Group were filed in 1996 and 1997. The Minister assumes as a fact that CC\u2019s appeal was filed in 1996, which was approximately six years prior to his death on March 9, 2002.[34]\n[101] The Respondent\u2019s proposition that the Appellant became responsible for raising a statute-barred issue following CC\u2019s death solely because she was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate is simply not tenable. Indeed, it is entirely unclear to me how the Appellant could be expected to identify the statute-barred issue for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years given that the issue arose from the expiry of the normal reassessment periods for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years in 1992 and 1993 and given that CC\u2019s appeal was filed some six years prior to his death.\n(2) Res Judicata and Abuse of Process [102] The Respondent further submits that the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process preclude the Appellant from raising the argument that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute\u2011barred. With respect to res judicata, the Respondent relies on issue estoppel, which is an aspect of the doctrine of res judicata. The abuse of process and res judicata doctrines share the same concerns and underlying principles. However, the abuse of process doctrine is more flexible.[35]\n[103] Rothstein J.A.\u2019s statement in Gaucher, which indicates that the Appellant\u2019s right to challenge the Disputed CC Reassessments is \u201ca basic rule of natural justice\u201d, suggests that this line of attack by the Respondent is misguided. Nevertheless, I will address the Respondent\u2019s position.\n[104] The Respondent submits that the three requirements for a finding of issue estoppel and abuse of process have been satisfied.\n[105] The first requirement identified by the Respondent is that the issue must be the same as the one decided in the prior decision. In CIBC, Hogan J. observes:\nTypically, when a party pleads issue estoppel, the first requirement is the most difficult to satisfy. To satisfy the first requirement, it is not sufficient that the question was incidental in the previous proceeding. As Angle instructs us, \u201c[t]he question out of which the estoppel is said to arise must have been \u201cfundamental to the decision arrived at in the earlier proceedings.\u201d[36]\n[Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added in the original.]\n[106] The issue raised by the Appellant in this appeal is that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute-barred and that therefore, the amounts of the Disputed CC Reassessments do not contribute to the amount determined under subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii). The issue decided in Makuz was that the reassessments appealed by the Group were correct. These issues are not the same.\n[107] Whether a reassessment is statute-barred and whether a reassessment is correct are two separate issues. The former issue must be decided in favour of the Minister before the latter issue comes into play. This is because a reassessment that is statute-barred is null and void[37] and therefore the determination of whether such a reassessment is correct does not arise.\n[108] The difference between the two issues is highlighted by the two distinct burdens of proof. A statute-barred issue in respect of which the Minister asserts that a reassessment is not null and void places a burden of proof on the Minister[38] while a correctness issue places a burden of proof on the taxpayer. The Minister must meet her burden of proof; otherwise, there is no reassessment giving rise to the correctness issue.\n[109] In this appeal, the Minister\u2019s burden of proof focuses on whether the Minister could issue valid reassessments for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years after the expiration of the normal reassessment periods for those years on the basis that CC had filed valid waivers for those years. I will return to the validity of the Waivers below.\n[110] The third requirement identified by the Respondent is that the parties to both proceedings must be the same or their privies. In Stallan, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stated the following, at paragraph 30 of that decision:\nFor the purposes of the doctrine of res judicata, another person is a \u201cprivy\u201d of a party to the lawsuit when there is a sufficient degree of common interest and identification between them which makes it just that the outcome should be binding over both parties. \u2026\n[111] For the reasons already stated, the parties in this appeal are not the same as the parties in CC\u2019s appeal. Moreover, the Appellant was not a privy of CC in respect of CC\u2019s income tax appeal because the Appellant had no personal interest in the subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal even though she was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate and a beneficiary of CC\u2019s estate.[39]\n[112] An income tax appeal relates to a particular taxpayer and to the liability of that taxpayer under the ITA for one or more taxation years. The subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal cannot be equated with the subject matter of, for example, a lawsuit by CC regarding the ownership of a property. It is only in the case of a lawsuit over property that the Appellant, as heir of CC, might be said to have an interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit.\n[113] The fact that a favourable result in CC\u2019s income tax appeal would have left more assets available to the Appellant in her capacity as heir of CC is an indirect consequence of the outcome of CC\u2019s income tax appeal. This indirect consequence does not establish that the Appellant had a sufficient degree of common interest in the subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal to constitute her a privy of CC in respect of that appeal.\n[114] I conclude, therefore, that the first and third requirements identified by the Respondent have not been satisfied.\n[115] This finding is not unfair to the Respondent. The Respondent has been fully notified of the statute\u2011barred issue in this appeal and has presented evidence to address that issue. The Minister is not prejudiced by the assertion by the Appellant that the Disputed CC Reassessments are statute\u2011barred, but the Appellant would be prejudiced if she could not raise that issue in this appeal.\n[116] I recognize that the effluxion of time may have impacted the ability of the Minister to meet her burden of proof regarding the Waivers. However, this results from the fact that the Minister assessed the Appellant under section 160 nearly 20 years after the Transfer and the expiration of the applicable normal reassessment periods, and not from any action or inaction by the Appellant.\n[117] On the basis of the foregoing, the principles of res judicata and abuse of process do not apply to preclude the Appellant from raising the statute\u2011barred issue in respect of the Disputed CC Reassessments.\n(3) The Validity of the Waivers (a) The 1988 Waiver [118] The Appellant submits that the 1988 Waiver was not signed by CC. The Respondent takes exception to the Appellant\u2019s evidence that the signature on the 1988 Waiver may not be that of CC.\n[119] The signature on the 1988 Waiver no doubt has a certain firmness that is not present in the signatures on the Deed and the 1989 Waiver. However, I am unable to conclude that the signature on the 1988 Waiver is not that of CC. The letters in all three signatures and the appearance and flow of those letters are sufficiently similar to preclude such a finding. Consequently, even if I permitted the Appellant\u2019s evidence on the signature, I would find that CC signed the 1988 Waiver.\n[120] I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that CC could not write in the English language and recognize that it is odd indeed that the 1988 Waiver has a handwritten address for CC that is wrong. However, this anomaly does not in and of itself invalidate the 1988 Waiver.\n[121] This leaves the question of when the 1988 Waiver was filed with the Minister. The text of the letter included in exhibit R-1 does not address the filing of the 1988 Waiver. The main paragraph of the letter states:\nAt the request of John Campbell of Miller Thomson, I have arranged for the waivers for the above named clients to be signed so that the discussion with Mr. Campbell and yourself regarding the matter of Claridge Holdings # 1 can continue. I trust this is what you require.\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[122] The text of the letter states only that the author has arranged for waivers to be signed but does not say anything about waivers being enclosed with the letter. As a result, the statement \u201cI trust this is what you require\u201d is at best ambiguous regarding whether the 1988 Waiver accompanied the letter.\n[123] Mr. Hassan testified that in 2019, he found the letter and the 1988 Waiver in CC\u2019s physical file. Mr. Hassan acknowledged that there was no indication that the letter and the 1988 Waiver had been stapled together. Also, the letter itself shows no indication of an enclosure (i.e., there is no \u201cEncl.\u201d or \u201cEnc.\u201d under the signature line, only the initials \u201c:ag\u201d).\n[124] Mr. Hussey testified that the practice of the CRA mailroom is to stamp the first page of a multi-page document. However, in the absence of evidence that the 1988 Waiver was attached to or enclosed with the letter, there is no factual basis on which to conclude that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were a multi-page document.\n[125] Mr. Hassan\u2019s testimony that in 2019, the letter and the 1988 Waiver were in the same physical file is not evidence that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were a single multi-page document, nor is it evidence that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were received at the same time. Documents in a physical file may be placed in that file at any time.\n[126] The inference that counsel for the Respondent is asking me to draw from Mr. Hassan\u2019s and Mr. Hussey\u2019s evidence is circular. The inference is that because the letter and the 1988 Waiver were in the same physical file in 2019 and because only the letter was stamped, the 1988 Waiver must have been attached to or enclosed with the letter. This inference in turn would explain why only the letter was stamped by the mailroom personnel. I decline to draw this inference because there is insufficient evidence to support the inference and, therefore, the inference is mere speculation.\n[127] The absence of a \u201creceived\u201d stamp on the 1988 Waiver is particularly troubling given that the waiver form has a box labelled \u201cFor Departmental Use Only\u201d and that, on the basis of the 1989 Waiver, Revenue Canada mailroom employees were aware of this box and were aware that the \u201creceived\u201d stamp should be placed in that box.\n[128] Mr. Hussey speculated that the reason for the mailroom policy of stamping the first page of a multi-page document was that the mailroom employees are not auditors and are not qualified to identify a waiver. However, the 1988 Waiver form states in large bold caps:\nWAIVER IN RESPECT OF THE\nNORMAL REASSESSMENT PERIOD\n[129] A waiver impacts a very material right of a taxpayer to the benefit of the Minister.[40] The waiver form is clearly identified as a waiver of the normal reassessment period and includes a box for a \u201creceived\u201d stamp. If the Minister has chosen to rely on a mailroom policy that reduces the evidential value of a waiver form received by the Minister, the consequences of that decision fall on the Minister rather than the Appellant.\n[130] On the basis of the foregoing, I find that there is insufficient evidence to determine the date on which the 1988 Waiver was received by the Minister. Consequently, with respect to the 1988 Waiver, the Minister has failed to meet her burden of proof under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) on a balance of probabilities.\n[131] Consequently, I find that the 1988 Transferor Reassessment was statute\u2011barred and that the amount of that reassessment is not included in the amount determined under paragraph 160(1)(e).\n(b) The 1989 Waiver [132] There is no dispute that the 1989 Waiver was received by the Minister on the date specified by the Revenue Canada mailroom stamp on that waiver. The Appellant submits that the Revenue Canada stamp on the 1989 Waiver indicates that that waiver was filed on May 31, 1993, which is the day after the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year expired.\n[133] Mr. Hussey testified that if the 1989 Waiver had been mailed to Revenue Canada, it \u201cshould not\u201d have had a stamp saying that it was hand-delivered.[41]\n[134] On the basis of the stamp on the 1989 Waiver and Mr. Hussey\u2019s testimony, I find that the 1989 Waiver was delivered by hand to Revenue Canada and was received by Revenue Canada on May 31, 1993, which is not within the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year.\n[135] The Respondent submits that the rule in section 26 of the Interpretation Act extended the deadline for filing the 1989 Waiver from May 30, 1993 to May 31, 1993. Consequently, the 1989 Waiver permits the Minister to reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period for that year.\n[136] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) allows the Minister to reassess a taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period if the taxpayer has filed a waiver. Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) states:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n...\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[Emphasis added.]\n[137] The question raised by the Respondent\u2019s position is whether section 26 of the Interpretation Act has the effect of deeming the 1989 Waiver to have been filed within the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year when the waiver was actually filed after the expiration of that normal reassessment period.\n[138] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act states:\nWhere the time limited for the doing of a thing expires or falls on a holiday, the thing may be done on the day next following that is not a holiday.[42]\n[139] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act is one of several rules in that statute to be applied when interpreting an Act of Parliament (including the Interpretation Act).[43] Section 12 of the Interpretation Act states:\nEvery enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[140] In Lubana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1348, Prothonotary Lafreni\u00e8re described the purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act as follows, at paragraph 6 of that decision:\n\u2026 The purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act is to relieve a party from being in default under the Rules when unable to take a step or to do a thing on the last day of fixed period which falls on a holiday and to deem such step taken or such thing done on the next practicable date to be performed timeously. \u2026\n[141] Counsel for the Appellant submits that there is no time limit for the filing of a waiver and that therefore, section 26 of the Interpretation Act does not apply to the filing of the 1989 Waiver. Counsel notes that the limitation period fixed by the normal reassessment period relates to the doing of a thing by the Minister (i.e., making a reassessment), not to the doing of a thing by the taxpayer.\n[142] Neither counsel cited a case that addresses the application of section 26 of the Interpretation Act to the filing of a waiver and I have been unable to find such a case. Consequently, the impact of section 26 of the Interpretation Act on the application of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) raises a novel question of statutory interpretation.\n[143] In paragraph 25 of R. v. Breault, 2023 SCC 9, the Supreme Court of Canada summarizes the proper approach to statutory interpretation as follows:\nEvery statutory interpretation exercise involves reading the words of a provision \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26; see also R. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 15, at para. 21).\n[144] In paragraphs 41 and 61 of Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51, the Supreme Court of Canada elaborates on this approach in the income tax context:\nThis narrow question of statutory interpretation requires us to draw upon the well-established framework that \u201cstatutory interpretation entails discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute\u2019s scheme and objects\u201d (Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, at para. 21). Where the rubber hits the road is in determining the relative weight to be afforded to the text, context and purpose. Where the words of a statute are \u201cprecise and unequivocal\u201d, their ordinary meaning will play a dominant role (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10). In the taxation context, a \u201cunified textual, contextual and purposive\u201d approach continues to apply (Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Finance), 2006 SCC 20, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 715, at para. 22, quoting Canada Trustco, at para. 47). In applying this unified approach, however, the particularity and detail of many tax provisions along with the Duke of Westminster principle (that taxpayers are entitled to arrange their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable) lead us to focus carefully on the text and context in assessing the broader purpose of the scheme (Placer Dome, at para. 21; Canada Trustco, at para. 11). ...\n...\nI again reiterate that if taxpayers are to act with any degree of certainty, then full effect should be given to Parliament\u2019s precise and unequivocal words. \u2026\n[145] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) extends the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year \u201conly if [CC] has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for [CC] in respect of\u201d CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year. The words \u201conly if\u201d emphasize that the words that follow stipulate a mandatory condition or requirement.\n[146] When one reads the words of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, the subparagraph identifies an event that must have occurred for a waiver to be effective: the taxpayer \u201chas filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year\u201d.\n[147] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) does not state a time limit for a taxpayer to file a waiver. Rather, subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) states that for the Minister to reassess a taxation year of a taxpayer after the normal reassessment period, the taxpayer must have filed a waiver prior to the expiry of that normal reassessment period. A taxpayer has three or four years[44] after an initial assessment or notification that no tax is payable to file a waiver that satisfies the condition in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii).\n[148] In Mitchell, the Federal Court of Canada \u2013 Appeal Division observed:\n\u2026 A waiver is a privilege which a taxpayer has, and, if sent, Revenue Canada cannot ignore it.[45]\n[149] A taxpayer that chooses not to file a waiver does not lose a right, such as the right to object to or appeal from an assessment. Rather, the taxpayer chooses not to give the Minister a right under subparagraph 152(4)(2)(a)(ii) to reassess the taxpayer beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[150] The filing of a waiver might in theory benefit a taxpayer that wishes the Minister to reassess what would otherwise be a statute\u2011barred taxation year of the taxpayer.[46]\n[151] However, the filing of a waiver by a taxpayer does not compel the Minister to reassess the taxation year of the taxpayer to which the waiver applies. In Imperial Oil Limited and Inco Limited v. R., 2003 TCC 46,[47] Bowman A.C.J. (as he then was) stated at paragraph 38:\nCounsel for the respondent argues that there is no way a taxpayer can protect itself from errors in its own returns other than, perhaps, relying upon the Minister\u2019s leniency in accepting amended returns and assessing so as to permit the taxpayer to object if the Minister refuses to give effect to the amended return. There is no mechanism whereby the Minister can be compelled to accept an amended return or to act upon it if he chooses not to. I do not share counsel\u2019s faith in the Minister\u2019s magnanimity in voluntarily accommodating a taxpayer\u2019s requests to amend its returns. A taxpayer\u2019s legal right to compel reassessments lies in the objection and appeal process.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[152] Consequently, by filing a waiver, the taxpayer does not preserve a right of the taxpayer that would cease to exist but for the filing of the waiver. The taxpayer preserves indefinitely[48] the right of the Minister to reassess the taxation year of the taxpayer covered by the waiver.\n[153] The application of section 26 of the Interpretation Act to the filing of the 1989 Waiver would not relieve CC of a default under the ITA. Rather, the only effect would be to relieve the Minister of compliance with a statutory limitation period.\n[154] In Markevich v. Canada, 2003 SCC 9, the Supreme Court of Canada identified the important purpose of limitation periods as follows, at paragraph 17 of that decision:\n\u2026 Limitation periods, on the other hand, are meant to promote certainty, avoid stale evidence, encourage diligence, and bring repose: see M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at p. 29, per La Forest J. \u2026\n[155] The Respondent is relying on a rule the purpose of which is to relieve a person faced with a deadline to do something\u2013such as object to or appeal from an assessment\u2013from breaching that deadline because the deadline falls on a holiday.\n[156] A taxpayer filing a waiver is not facing a deadline that would preclude the taxpayer from doing anything. A waiver is valid \u201conly if\u201d it is filed within the normal reassessment period. The deadline relates solely to the validity of the waiver itself, not to the doing of something by the person filing the waiver.\n[157] In my view, it would be inconsistent with the text, context and purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act and of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) to apply section 26 to deem a waiver to have been filed within the normal reassessment period when the benefit of the rule accrues solely to the Minister\u2013a person who has done nothing\u2013and the taxpayer is deprived of an important right under the ITA.\n[158] On the basis of the foregoing, I find nothing in the text, context, and purpose of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) or section 26 of the Interpretation Act that would justify the application of the latter provision to extend indefinitely the normal reassessment period of the 1989 taxation year of CC.\n[159] Consequently, I find that the 1989 Transferor Reassessment was statute\u2011barred and that the amount of that reassessment is not included in the amount determined under subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii).\nD. The Payment of $382,377 [160] The parties agree that the estate of CC paid $382,377 to the CRA on or about September 19, 2003. The Respondent says that the Minister applied this payment to reduce CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 taxation year. The Appellant submits that there is no evidence to support this and requests that the Court direct that the payment reduce the amount owed by CC for his 1988 taxation year.\n[161] Given my conclusion that the Disputed CC Reassessments are statute\u2011barred, the application of the payment to reduce CC\u2019s liability for his 1988 taxation year is moot. In any event, the proper application of the payment to reduce a tax debt of CC is a collection matter that is outside this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.[49]\nV. Conclusion [162] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal from the Assessment is allowed with costs to the Appellant, and the Assessment is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the reassessments of the 1988 and 1989 taxation years of CC by notices dated April 21, 1994 were statute\u2011barred.\n[163] The parties shall have 60 days from the date of this judgment to agree on costs. If no agreement is reached, the Appellant shall have a further 30 days to submit written submissions on costs.

I.2 (the \u201cOITA\u201d) of $289,333.60 plus accrued interest. This Court has no jurisdiction over provincial income tax assessments. However, by virtue of subsections 1(3) and (6), section 14, and Part IV of the OITA, the result under the OITA will follow the result under the ITA.\n[3] The PASF, which is described in section C of this judgment, states the address of the Property as 7286 10th Line, R.R. #2 Streetsville, Ontario. There is, however, no dispute as to the identity of the Property.\n[4] The parties agree that the references in the chart to 1998 and 1999 should be to 1988 and 1989.\n[5] Paragraphs 11 a) through q) of the Amended Reply.\n[6] Lines 26 to 28 of page 68 and lines 1 to 5 of page 69 of the Transcript of the Hearing on September 11, 2023.\n[7] Lines 4 to 9 of page 30 of the Transcript of the Hearing on September 11, 2023.\n[8] Lines 17 to 28 of page 80 and lines 1 to 7 of page 81 of the Transcript of the Hearing on September 11, 2023.\n[9] Lines 23 to 28 of page 81 and lines 1 to 4 of page 82 of the Transcript of the Hearing on September 11, 2023.\n[10] Lines 22 to 27 of page 98 of the Transcript of the Hearing on September 11, 2023.\n[11] Exhibits A-1 and A-2.\n[12] Exhibit A-1.

The assumption of fact in paragraph 11 q) of the Amended Reply states that the 1989 Waiver was mailed to the Minister.\n[18] Makuz v. R., 2006 TCC 263 (\u201cMakuz\u201d).\n[19] Counsel for the Respondent objected to this statement of opinion when given by the Appellant, and I upheld the objection. I note, however, that the \u201copinion\u201d is a factual inference that the Court is entitled to draw from the totality of the evidence, if the evidence supports that inference.\n[20] R.S.C. 1985, c. l-21.\n[21] Paragraphs 111 and 112 of the Respondent\u2019s Written Representations.\n[22] Amendments to paragraphs 160(1)(d) and (e) that came into force on June 26, 2013 are not relevant to this appeal.

I note that if the Minister takes the position that she is precluded from reassessing a taxation year, the burden of proof would fall on the taxpayer to establish the existence of a valid and timely waiver: Mitchell v.

DiPierdomenico, est un facteur pour Postes Canada \u00e0 Windsor (Ontario). \u00c0 une certaine \u00e9poque, il poss\u00e9dait \u00e9galement un salon de manucure. Cette entreprise a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une v\u00e9rification par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb). L\u2019ARC affirme que la v\u00e9rification a pris fin avec l\u2019envoi d\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 et 2016, mais que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a signifi\u00e9 aucun avis d\u2019opposition dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour contester ces nouvelles cotisations et qu\u2019il n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du ministre du Revenu national, en temps opportun, aucune demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[2] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7u d\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation avant de retenir les services de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Fraser Simpson, \u00e0 la fin de 2019 ou au d\u00e9but de 2020. Le 9 juin 2022, M. Simpson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande aupr\u00e8s de la Cour en vue d\u2019obtenir une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour s\u2019opposer \u00e0 ces nouvelles cotisations[1].\n[3] Le requ\u00e9rant souhaite contester les nouvelles cotisations et, \u00e0 cette fin, demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019accueillir sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour s\u2019opposer aux nouvelles cotisations.\nPosition du requ\u00e9rant\n[4] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u [les] avis de nouvell[e] cotisatio[n] \u00bb[2].\nPreuve du requ\u00e9rant\n[5] La Cour a entendu virtuellement la preuve du requ\u00e9rant et a re\u00e7u la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous forme d\u2019affidavits d\u2019agents de l\u2019ARC.\n[6] En entendant la preuve du requ\u00e9rant, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par l\u2019absence de documents et l\u2019impr\u00e9cision de ses souvenirs. Avant l\u2019audience, la Cour l\u2019a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner virtuellement de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Windsor (Ontario). On aurait pu penser que le requ\u00e9rant aurait tous les documents pertinents devant lui, mais il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de produire un seul document en preuve.\n[7] Par exemple, le requ\u00e9rant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en disant que la correspondance de l\u2019ARC \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab au mieux sporadique \u00bb, mais n\u2019a produit aucune copie ou indication de cette correspondance. C\u2019est un point important, puisque le requ\u00e9rant a fond\u00e9 sa cause sur le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun avis de nouvelle cotisation. A-t-il re\u00e7u du courrier de l\u2019ARC? Dans l\u2019affirmative, quand? A-t-il re\u00e7u du courrier d\u2019autres exp\u00e9diteurs? Cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tant sans fondement factuel, ce qui est \u00e9trange, d\u2019autant plus que le requ\u00e9rant est lui-m\u00eame un facteur.\n[8] La preuve par affidavit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a permis de rem\u00e9dier aux nombreuses lacunes dans les vagues souvenirs du requ\u00e9rant en ce qui concerne les dates et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve cr\u00e9dible pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les affidavits de l\u2019ARC.\nDispositions l\u00e9gislatives\n[9] J\u2019examinerai les nouvelles cotisations en deux groupes. Le premier groupe comprend les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012 et 2013. Le deuxi\u00e8me groupe comprend les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015 et 2016. Toutefois, avant de les examiner, j\u2019exposerai les dispositions applicables de la Loi et je soulignerais que le mot \u00ab cotisation \u00bb comprend une \u00ab nouvelle cotisation \u00bb (Loi, par. 248(1)) :\nOpposition \u00e0 la cotisation\n165(1) Le contribuable qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une cotisation pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente partie peut signifier au ministre, par \u00e9crit, un avis d\u2019opposition exposant les motifs de son opposition et tous les faits pertinents, dans les d\u00e9lais suivants :\na) s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une cotisation, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, relative \u00e0 un contribuable qui est un particulier [\u2026] au plus tard au dernier en date des jours suivants :\n(i) le jour qui tombe un an apr\u00e8s la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e,\n(ii) le quatre-vingt-dixi\u00e8me jour suivant la date d\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis de cotisation; [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nProrogation du d\u00e9lai par le ministre\n166.1(1) Le contribuable qui n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 une cotisation en application de l\u2019article 165 [\u2026] dans le d\u00e9lai imparti peut demander au ministre de proroger le d\u00e9lai pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026].\n[\u2026]\nConditions d\u2019acceptation de la demande\n166.1(7) Il n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) la demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition [\u2026];\nb) le contribuable d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\n(i) dans le d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026], il n\u2019a pu ni agir ni charger quelqu\u2019un d\u2019agir en son nom, ou il avait v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019intention de faire opposition \u00e0 la cotisation [\u2026],\n(ii) compte tenu des raisons indiqu\u00e9es dans la demande et des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 la demande,\n(iii) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient.\nProrogation du d\u00e9lai par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t\n166.2(1) Le contribuable qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en application de l\u2019article 166.1 peut demander \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019y faire droit apr\u00e8s :\na) le rejet de la demande par le ministre;\nb) l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours suivant la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande, si le ministre n\u2019a pas avis\u00e9 le contribuable de sa d\u00e9cision.\nToutefois, une telle demande ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours suivant la date de la mise \u00e0 la poste de l\u2019avis de la d\u00e9cision au contribuable.\n[\u2026]\nAcceptation de la demande\n166.2(5) Il n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application du paragraphe 166.1(1) dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition [\u2026];\nb) le contribuable d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\n(i) dans le d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026], il n\u2019a pu ni agir ni charger quelqu\u2019un d\u2019agir en son nom, ou il avait v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019intention de faire opposition \u00e0 la cotisation [\u2026],\n(ii) compte tenu des raisons indiqu\u00e9es dans la demande et des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 la demande,\n(iii) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient.\nNouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012 et 2013\n[10] L\u2019ARC affirme avoir envoy\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant les avis de nouvelle cotisation suivants par la poste \u00e0 la date suivante :\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2011 Le 4 juillet 2016\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2012 Le 4 juillet 2016\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2013 Le 4 juillet 2016\n[11] Le requ\u00e9rant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun de ces avis de nouvelle cotisation. Il me demande de conclure que le ministre ne lui a pas envoy\u00e9 ces avis \u00e0 la date indiqu\u00e9e sur chaque avis.

C\u2019est la fin de l\u2019instance parce que le paragraphe 166.2(1) interdit alors au requ\u00e9rant de d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de la Cour une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition.\n[20] Le d\u00e9faut du requ\u00e9rant de respecter la condition pr\u00e9alable au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai aupr\u00e8s de la Cour est fatal \u00e0 sa demande concernant les nouvelles cotisations pour 2015 et 2016.

Introduction\n[1] L\u2019appelante a interjet\u00e9 appel en vertu de la proc\u00e9dure informelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie en application de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (LIR) par le ministre du Revenu national (ministre), pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018. En vertu de cette cotisation, le ministre a impos\u00e9 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 5 858 $ en application du paragraphe 227(9) de la LIR en raison de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s versements tardifs de retenues \u00e0 la source sur les salaires pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018 pour un total de 61 084,96 $.\n[2] Le paragraphe 227(9) de la LIR dispose ce qui suit :\nRetenue des imp\u00f4ts\nD\u00e9faut de remettre une retenue \u00e0 la source\n(9) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (9.5), toute personne qui ne remet pas ou ne paye pas au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e civile, de la mani\u00e8re et dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi ou \u00e0 son r\u00e8glement, un montant d\u00e9duit ou retenu conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi ou \u00e0 son r\u00e8glement ou un montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019elle doit payer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 116 ou \u00e0 une disposition r\u00e9glementaire prise en application du paragraphe 215(4) est passible d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 :\na) soit, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) :\n(i) [\u2026],\n(ii) si le receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral re\u00e7oit ce montant :\n(A) [\u2026],\n(B) [\u2026],\n(C) [\u2026],\n(iii) si ce montant n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9 ou remis au plus tard le septi\u00e8me jour suivant la date o\u00f9 il est exigible, de 10 % du montant;\nb) soit de 20 % du montant qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre remis ou pay\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e si, au moment du d\u00e9faut, une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 en application du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe \u00e9tait payable par la personne et si le d\u00e9faut a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde.\n[3] La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait de 10 %.\n[4] La d\u00e9cision du ministre d\u2019imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 d\u00e9coule essentiellement d\u2019un conflit entre les parties concernant les salaires vers\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 deux employ\u00e9s. L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9termin\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2018, une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration finale \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 un examen des comptes de fiducie de la paie de l\u2019appelante pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 une r\u00e9partition salariale diff\u00e9rente entre les deux employ\u00e9s, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une reformulation des versements de retenues sur la paie de l\u2019appelante en vertu de la LIR et du R\u00e8glement applicable. La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur les versements tardifs de l\u2019appelante.\n[5] L\u2019unique actionnaire, administrateur et dirigeant de l\u2019appelante est M. Allan Sutton. L\u2019appelante exploite une entreprise immobili\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d\u00e9tentrice de permis plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re personnelle. M. Sutton est un agent de ventes immobili\u00e8res et est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme la principale source de recettes de l\u2019appelante. Mme Angela Sutton, conjointe de M. Sutton, est \u00e9galement employ\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante. Elle est une courti\u00e8re agr\u00e9\u00e9e agissant \u00e0 titre de courti\u00e8re gestionnaire aux fins des activit\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res de l\u2019appelante. Son statut permet \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d\u00e9tentrice de permis. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Mme Sutton, l\u2019appelante peut exercer ses activit\u00e9s sans d\u00e9pendre d\u2019une maison de courtage. M. Sutton d\u00e9crit cet avantage comme une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e obligeant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir des comptes de fiducie, \u00e0 faire des rapports comptables, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des rapports annuels aupr\u00e8s de la Financial Services Authority de la province. M. Sutton ajoute qu\u2019une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e entra\u00eene une gouvernance \u00e0 un niveau beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[6] M. et Mme Sutton sont les deux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante. Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelante, en vertu de l\u2019entente conclue entre M. et Mme Sutton, d\u00e9termine \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e la contribution que chacun a apport\u00e9e au succ\u00e8s et aux recettes de l\u2019appelante pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sutton, Mme Sutton est un ajout cl\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante et, sans elle, le succ\u00e8s de l\u2019appelante serait certainement diff\u00e9rent. Elle lui permet de se concentrer sur des aspects particuliers des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante tout en \u00e9tant charg\u00e9e de toutes les autres t\u00e2ches. De plus, elle l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de mandats particuliers au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Elle peut aussi trouver des aiguillages. Pour M. Sutton, elle est un atout pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et m\u00e9rite une juste reconnaissance.\n[7] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2018, l\u2019appelante a vers\u00e9 de retenues sur la paie en fonction d\u2019une estimation du salaire de chaque employ\u00e9. \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, les deux employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9 leur examen de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 un salaire en fonction de leurs contributions dans l\u2019entreprise. Les formulaires et les feuillets pr\u00e9vus par r\u00e8glement pour 2018 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante en fonction de ces r\u00e9sultats. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme et M. Sutton ont re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale de 165 000 $ et de 192 000 $, respectivement.\n[8] Au moyen d\u2019un avis de cotisation dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2020, le ministre a \u00e9tabli une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelante visant un versement tardif du solde des retenues sur la paie pour 2018 de 1 745 $ et il lui a impos\u00e9 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 correspondante de 10 %, soit 124 $. Cette cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019examen des comptes de fiducie par l\u2019ARC. L\u2019ARC a d\u00e9termin\u00e9, entre autres, une r\u00e9partition de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rente entre les deux employ\u00e9s en fonction des montants d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans les comptes bancaires personnels de Mme et de M. Sutton sous forme de ch\u00e8ques re\u00e7us de l\u2019appelante.\n[9] Une deuxi\u00e8me cotisation au moyen d\u2019un avis de cotisation dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2020 a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des versements des retenues sur la paie de l\u2019appelante pour 2018 strictement pour imposer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour versement tardif de 10 %, soit 5 858 $. Cette deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 concerne une r\u00e9affectation des versements mensuels de retenue sur la paie par l\u2019ARC que l\u2019appelante aurait d\u00fb faire en fonction de la nouvelle r\u00e9partition de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les deux employ\u00e9s. Seule cette deuxi\u00e8me cotisation fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel.\n[10] Le pr\u00e9sent appel vise \u00e0 trancher une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience que le fardeau de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 incombe \u00e0 la Couronne. Cela signifie que, si la r\u00e9affectation de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e ou, devrais-je dire, n\u2019est pas \u00e9tablie par l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de maintenir la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a cit\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 que le seul fondement pour le ministre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette nouvelle d\u00e9termination de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les deux employ\u00e9s s\u2019appuie sur le seul examen des relev\u00e9s bancaires de l\u2019appelante, des copies des ch\u00e8ques de l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de qui les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9taient \u00e9tablis. Selon ce seul examen, les ch\u00e8ques et relev\u00e9s bancaires confirmaient que le montant total de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des deux employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le compte bancaire personnel de M. Sutton, sauf un montant total de 12 675 $ qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le compte bancaire personnel de Mme Sutton.\n[12] La Cour n\u2019a entendu aucun agent ou employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC. Au cours de l\u2019examen des comptes de fiducie par l\u2019ARC, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e ni invit\u00e9e \u00e0 expliquer les motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019option de paiement retenue par l\u2019appelante, ni Mme Sutton, ni M. Sutton, ni leur comptable.\n[13] Pour la Cour, la proc\u00e9dure suivie par l\u2019ARC consistant \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen n\u2019est pas la plus convaincante. La proc\u00e9dure indique clairement un examen s\u00e9lectif, ce qui donne l\u2019apparence d\u2019un examen partiel seulement du contexte r\u00e9el. Cela ressort particuli\u00e8rement de l\u2019absence de tout t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019ARC pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se et de tout contact pendant la v\u00e9rification des comptes de fiducie avec les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Cela est plut\u00f4t probl\u00e9matique dans un contexte o\u00f9 le fardeau incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[14] Mme et M. Sutton ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Cour estime que les deux sont cr\u00e9dibles. Tous deux ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une connaissance de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019expliquer en termes raisonnables les consid\u00e9rations relatives \u00e0 leur d\u00e9cision de fixer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration vers\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante.\n[15] M. Sutton a \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le t\u00e9moin n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 les montants qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante. Il a expos\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont ils s\u2019entendent sur leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et le moment auquel ils le font. Il signe les ch\u00e8ques de l\u2019appelante. La Cour comprend qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une entreprise relativement petite et que, compte tenu de la volatilit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s, il peut \u00eatre difficile de pr\u00e9voir une juste r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sans savoir ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par chacun d\u2019eux avant la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Il a expliqu\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles sa conjointe recevait une petite r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration mensuelle vers\u00e9e directement \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re et quelle \u00e9tait l\u2019origine de ce montant. Mme Sutton confirme \u00e9galement les m\u00eames raisons pour lesquelles sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est un honoraire mensuel, soit l\u2019honoraire qu\u2019elle facturait \u00e0 d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res en contrepartie de ses services de courtage de base.\n[16] Il n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 que les deux r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son compte bancaire personnel sous forme d\u2019un seul ch\u00e8que qu\u2019il signe en fonction des flux de tr\u00e9sorerie disponibles de l\u2019appelante, de temps \u00e0 autre. Il n\u2019a pas confirm\u00e9 que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait le sien seul. Il a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente et qu\u2019il aurait pu signer deux ch\u00e8ques. Il n\u2019estimait pas que cela \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils s\u2019entendent tous deux sur la proc\u00e9dure et la r\u00e9partition finale qu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Pour lui, les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts dans un seul compte et le droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quitable \u00e9taient distincts et l\u2019un n\u2019\u00e9tait certainement pas un gage de l\u2019autre.\n[17] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Sutton portait sur sa propre compr\u00e9hension de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 relativement br\u00e8ve, mais claire et v\u00e9ridique. La Cour n\u2019a pas cru que son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait marginal, mais qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable employ\u00e9e \u00e0 qui une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e en contrepartie d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable rendement. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, son rendement de travail dans l\u2019ensemble pouvait varier au cours des ann\u00e9es et elle devait assumer, chaque ann\u00e9e, ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de courti\u00e8re agr\u00e9\u00e9e.\n[18] Mme Sutton a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour elle, le fait que sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le compte bancaire personnel de son conjoint ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9occupation. Elle a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet argent. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 clairement qu\u2019elle consentait \u00e0 cette entente et elle a autoris\u00e9 que l\u2019argent soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans un seul compte. Voici la fa\u00e7on dont elle a expliqu\u00e9 la situation : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Je recevais de l\u2019argent de fa\u00e7on constructive par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de notre compte [\u2026]. Donc, le compte paierait mes factures directes personnelles, mon visa, et il payait aussi nos d\u00e9penses partag\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[19] Le contre-interrogatoire n\u2019a pas permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9molir les th\u00e8ses exprim\u00e9es par les deux t\u00e9moins. Il n\u2019est cependant pas exclu que la pi\u00e8ce A-1 et la pi\u00e8ce A-7 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante d\u00e9montrent une certaine divergence quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination exacte du salaire vers\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9. Cela s\u2019explique notamment par le fait confirm\u00e9 par Mme Sutton au sujet du pourcentage des d\u00e9penses communes qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es en 2018. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que sa part des d\u00e9penses communes \u00e9tait de 11 % et non de 50 %. Cette confirmation pourrait \u00eatre fausse ou exacte. Pour cette raison, la r\u00e9partition telle que d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine entre l\u2019appelante et les employ\u00e9s serait alors erron\u00e9e.\n[20] Nonobstant le paragraphe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il demeure clair pour la Cour que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Sutton en 2018, d\u00e9passait 12 675 $. Le fait qu\u2019une telle r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 en partie vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Sutton par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du compte bancaire de M. Sutton n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la th\u00e8se de Mme Sutton et de l\u2019appelante selon laquelle elle a touchait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019appelante. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayent le fait que Mme Sutton a autoris\u00e9 que les montants soient vers\u00e9s dans le compte bancaire de M. Sutton, qu\u2019elle tirait toujours un avantage du d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans ce compte, et qu\u2019elle avait un droit inconditionnel de se faire payer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, le principe de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e s\u2019applique.\n[21] Le principe de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, aux fins de la LIR, comporte deux facteurs centraux qui permettent \u00e0 un contribuable de [traduction] \u00ab recevoir \u00bb des fonds m\u00eame s\u2019il ne les a pas directement [traduction] \u00ab entre ses mains \u00bb. Selon le paragraphe 5 (1) de la LIR, le revenu est un salaire tir\u00e9 par un contribuable au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e. La jurisprudence a rappel\u00e9 que le mot [traduction] \u00ab recevoir \u00bb signifie obtenir ou tirer un avantage de quelque chose, donc [traduction] \u00ab en jouir sans n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019avoir entre les mains \u00bb[1]. En outre, une somme d\u2019argent est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre re\u00e7ue par un employ\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle est \u00e0 sa disposition[2]. La d\u00e9cision Blenkarn offre un exemple o\u00f9 l\u2019argent pour payer le salaire du contribuable en 1960 \u00e9tait disponible [pour le contribuable], mais il a volontairement choisi de ne pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9 avant 1961. Le contribuable a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u l\u2019argent parce que le paiement \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme [traduction] \u00ab re\u00e7u \u00bb d\u00e8s qu\u2019il avait un droit inconditionnel d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9, soit en 1960.\n[22] Dans la d\u00e9cision Markman[3], la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019une somme est vers\u00e9e par un employeur \u00e0 un tiers au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du contribuable, le paiement constitue une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e entre les mains du contribuable. Dans la d\u00e9cision Belusic[4], le juge Bowman a soulign\u00e9 que, pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, il faut satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des deux conditions suivantes, ou aux deux :\n1)L\u2019appelante devrait autoriser le paiement ou, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, y consentir\n2)M\u00eame dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle n\u2019avait pas autoris\u00e9 le paiement ou n\u2019y avait pas acquiesc\u00e9, il aurait fallu au moins qu\u2019il ait l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale d\u2019effectuer le remboursement de sorte que le paiement [\u2026] avait pour effet de le lib\u00e9rer de cette obligation\n[23] Les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le juge Bowman pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s dans des affaires ult\u00e9rieures. Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour, dans la d\u00e9cision Sherman[5], en citant la d\u00e9cision Morin, a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 que, selon la th\u00e9orie de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, le prestataire n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u le montant en question, mais n\u2019a re\u00e7u qu\u2019un avantage correspondant. Ces notions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reprises par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cheema[6], citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Innovative Installation[7], qui a conclu que la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e pouvait s\u2019appliquer lorsqu\u2019une personne avait un droit contractuel \u00e0 recevoir un paiement.\n[24] La Cour estime que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le pr\u00e9sent appel soutiennent le fait que la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que Mme Sutton a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019appelante.\n[25] Tel que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, m\u00eame si la Cour ne peut confirmer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration exacte re\u00e7ue par Mme Sutton, et indirectement par M. Sutton, il demeure \u00e9vident que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration utilis\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC pour imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e.\n[26] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Simard[8], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fourni des \u00e9claircissements sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imposition et de d\u00e9termination de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s. L\u2019arr\u00eat Simard portait sur les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour faute lourde en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la LIR. Toutefois, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a utilis\u00e9 un libell\u00e9 large dans ses commentaires sur la mesure dans laquelle la Cour peut intervenir dans l\u2019imposition de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s. La Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa d\u00e9cision du ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e par voie d\u2019appel devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la cotisation qui la pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve, mais dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Cour constate que les faits y donnent ouverture, elle ne peut que la confirmer. En tant que ministre, la Cour n\u2019a aucune discr\u00e9tion quant au montant de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019en a concernant les int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[27] Dans la d\u00e9cision Portland[9], le juge Mogan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLes obligations de retenir sont rigides, et celles de remettre les sommes sont \u00e9galement rigides. La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 227(9) est prescrite par la loi, et la Cour n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence de r\u00e9duire cette p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019annuler, parce qu\u2019elle est impos\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur. Si l\u2019on satisfait aux conditions qui d\u00e9clenchent l\u2019application de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 (versement tardif), alors l\u2019obligation est \u00e9tablie.\n[28] Le r\u00f4le de la Cour consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non valablement impos\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre question en appel. De plus, ajuster le montant d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e outrepasserait la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour. Pour ce motif, il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne permettent pas de conclure que les conditions d\u2019imposition de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par le ministre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies. En effet, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par les employ\u00e9s et utilis\u00e9e par le ministre pour imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e et entra\u00eene n\u00e9cessairement une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 erron\u00e9e.\n[29] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les faits du pr\u00e9sent appel ne donnent pas lieu \u00e0 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le ministre. La Cour n\u2019a aucun pouvoir en mati\u00e8re de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, autre que d\u2019accueillir (refuser la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9) ou de rejeter (confirmer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9) l\u2019appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli, sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Belleville (Ontario), ce 8e jour de janvier2024.\n\u00ab J.M.

Dans de telles circonstances, il est important de souligner que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tay\u00e9s par une preuve documentaire ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve provenant d\u2019un tiers.

La premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9claration a commenc\u00e9 le 1\u1d49\u02b3 d\u00e9cembre 2016 et s\u2019est termin\u00e9e le 31 ao\u00fbt 2018. La deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie a commenc\u00e9 le 1\u1d49\u02b3 d\u00e9cembre 2018 et s\u2019est termin\u00e9e le 31 mai 2019.\n[3] Il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur deux dates critiques. D\u2019abord, il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur la date \u00e0 laquelle le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) a envoy\u00e9 des avis de cotisation \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante. Cette date \u00e9tait le 27 novembre 2019.\n[4] Ensuite, il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur la date \u00e0 laquelle la requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du ministre une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition. Cette date \u00e9tait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\n[5] Il est \u00e9galement admis que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du ministre dans les 90 jours suivant la date de mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA.\n[6] La seule question en litige consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en temps utile sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition.\nPosition de la Couronne\n[7] Selon la Couronne, la requ\u00e9rante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition avec un jour de retard. Selon la th\u00e8se de la Couronne, la derni\u00e8re date \u00e0 laquelle la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter sa demande au ministre \u00e9tait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\nPosition de la requ\u00e9rante\n[8] La requ\u00e9rante affirme que la derni\u00e8re date \u00e0 laquelle elle aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition \u00e9tait un jour plus tard \u2013 le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u2013 la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a effectivement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande.\n[9] Le paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA accorde un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de mise \u00e0 la poste de l\u2019avis de cotisation pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition. Si cette date limite n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 303(7)a) accorde une ann\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9poser une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai aupr\u00e8s du ministre pour faire opposition. Si le ministre refuse la demande, la Cour peut l\u2019accorder, mais, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 304(5)a), la Cour ne peut l\u2019accorder si elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre dans cette ann\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[10] J\u2019ai reproduit les dispositions pertinentes dans leur contexte l\u00e9gislatif [je souligne] :\n[11] Deux questions relatives au choix du moment se posent. La premi\u00e8re concerne la p\u00e9riode d\u2019opposition de 90 jours et la seconde concerne la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an.\n[12] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question sur le d\u00e9lai d\u00e9pend de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA, qui pr\u00e9voit le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition :\n[13] Dans ses observations, la requ\u00e9rante insiste beaucoup sur le mot \u00ab suivant \u00bb dans l\u2019expression du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA qui pr\u00e9voit que la personne doit pr\u00e9senter un avis d\u2019opposition dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant le jour o\u00f9 l\u2019avis de cotisation lui est envoy\u00e9.\n[14] La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9tend que le mot \u00ab suivant \u00bb signifie que le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition d\u00e9bute le lendemain de l\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis de cotisation par le ministre. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le ministre a envoy\u00e9 des avis de cotisation \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante le 27 novembre 2019, nous devrions compter les 90 jours \u00e0 compter du 28 novembre 2019.\n[15] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, la requ\u00e9rante invoque les paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation :\n27(5) Lorsqu\u2019un acte doit \u00eatre accompli dans un d\u00e9lai qui suit [\u2026] un jour d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ce jour ne compte pas[1].\n[16] La Couronne souscrit \u00e0 cette proposition[2]. Je suis convaincu que cette interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA est correcte.\n[17] La requ\u00e9rante soutient ensuite que, puisque le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours commen\u00e7ait le 28 novembre 2019 (soit le lendemain de la mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation), le 90\u1d49 jour tombait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2020[3]. Selon la th\u00e8se de la requ\u00e9rante, le dernier jour pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2020.\n[18] Le calcul par la requ\u00e9rante du d\u00e9lai d\u2019opposition de 90 jours est erron\u00e9. Si on commence \u00e0 compter \u00e0 partir du lendemain de la date de mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation, soit le 28 novembre 2019, le 90\u1d49 jour tombait effectivement le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition devait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans ces 90 jours, le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition tombait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. C\u2019\u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition sans avoir \u00e0 demander une prorogation du d\u00e9lai.\n[19] Compte tenu des paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, je suis convaincu que le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020 \u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre un avis d\u2019opposition.\n[20] Maintenant que nous avons fix\u00e9 cette date, comment calculer le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour pr\u00e9senter une demande de prorogation?\n[21] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question sur le d\u00e9lai d\u00e9pend de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des alin\u00e9as 303(7)a) et 304(5)a) de la LTA, qui pr\u00e9voient le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour pr\u00e9senter une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition :\n[22] Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli que le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e9tait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020.\n[23] La requ\u00e9rante soutient que la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an devrait \u00eatre comptabilis\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du lendemain du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle s\u2019appuie encore une fois sur les paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\n[24] Si la th\u00e8se de la requ\u00e9rante est exacte, le dernier jour pour d\u00e9poser sa demande \u00e9tait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u2013 jour o\u00f9 elle a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[25] L\u2019approche de la requ\u00e9rante concernant le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an est erron\u00e9e. Je conviens avec la Couronne que le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre.\n[26] La faille dans l\u2019argumentation de la requ\u00e9rante r\u00e9sulte de la fusion d\u2019unit\u00e9s de temps. La disposition traitant de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019opposition utilise l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019un jour pour calculer le d\u00e9lai. Les dispositions traitant de la p\u00e9riode de demande utilisent l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e pour calculer le d\u00e9lai.\n[27] Le paragraphe 37(1) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est la disposition applicable lorsque la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est une ann\u00e9e \u2013 et non les paragraphes 27(4) ou 27(5). Le paragraphe 37(1) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation nous dit simplement que l\u2019expression \u00ab ann\u00e9e \u00bb s\u2019entend de toute p\u00e9riode de douze mois cons\u00e9cutifs[4].\n[28] Nous revenons maintenant aux dispositions en cause :\n[29] L\u2019expression \u00ab dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai \u00bb signifie exactement cela \u2013 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration des 90 jours. La derni\u00e8re date qui tombe dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020 est le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\n[30] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 303(7)a) de la LTA. Je dois donc rejeter la demande de la requ\u00e9rante et je le ferai sans frais.

Introduction\n[1] Il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saccord quant aux faits. Il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saccord quant aux chiffres.\n[2] En 2008, l\u2019appelant ach\u00e8te un duplex \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[3] Il a occup\u00e9 le bas du logement \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sidence principale et il a mis en location \u00e0 des tiers le haut du logement.\n[4] En 2017, l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de louer le logement du haut. Il a effectu\u00e9 des r\u00e9novations afin de transformer le duplex en r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale.\n[5] Suite \u00e0 ces modifications, l\u2019appelant utilisait la r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sidence principale. Il y\u2019a donc eu un changement d\u2019usage en 2017.\n[6] Cette transformation en 2017 a provoqu\u00e9 une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e suite au changement d\u2019usage partiel et, en cons\u00e9quence, un gain en capital et un gain en capital imposable.\n[7] En juin 2018, l\u2019appelant produit sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2017 ; dans cette d\u00e9claration il d\u00e9clare un gain en capital relatif au changement d\u2019usage et il ne fait pas de demande de reporter le gain en capital selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[8] La cotisation initiale du ministre accepte la d\u00e9claration de revenus de l\u2019appelant telle que produite.\n[9] Le 13 novembre 2018, l\u2019appelant signifie un avis d\u2019opposition afin d\u2019exercer son choix selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[10] Le ministre a confirm\u00e9 la cotisation initiale.\n[11] L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il pouvait faire le choix de reporter le gain en capital.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend le contraire. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le choix n\u2019\u00e9tait disponible que s\u2019il y avait un changement d\u2019usage de la totalit\u00e9 du bien, le duplex.\n[13] Il y a eu des amendements au paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu qui sont entr\u00e9s en vigueur apr\u00e8s le 18 mars 2019.\n[14] \u00c0 la fin de 2017 le texte du paragraphe 45(3) \u00e9tait :\n(3) Malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe (1), le contribuable qui cesse \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin n\u2019est pas r\u00e9put\u00e9 en avoir dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et l\u2019avoir acquis de nouveau aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s si le bien devient la r\u00e9sidence principale du contribuable et si le contribuable en fait le choix par avis \u00e9crit au ministre au plus tard au premier en date des jours suivants :\na) le 90e jour suivant l\u2019envoi au contribuable d\u2019une demande formelle du ministre de produire ce choix;\nb) la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition o\u00f9 il a effectivement dispos\u00e9 du bien.\n(Je souligne.)\n[15] Actuellement, le texte du paragraphe 45(3) est :\n(3) Malgr\u00e9 les alin\u00e9as (1)a) et c), si un contribuable cesse totalement ou partiellement \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin, ou en partie \u00e0 cette fin, il n\u2019est pas r\u00e9put\u00e9 en avoir dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et l\u2019avoir acquis de nouveau aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s si le bien devient, en tout ou en partie, la r\u00e9sidence principale du contribuable et si le contribuable en fait le choix par avis \u00e9crit au ministre au plus tard au premier en date des jours suivants :\na) le 90e jour suivant l\u2019envoi au contribuable d\u2019une demande formelle du ministre de produire ce choix ;\nb) la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition o\u00f9 il a effectivement dispos\u00e9 du bien.\n(Je souligne.)\n[16] Si le changement d\u2019usage avait eu lieu apr\u00e8s le 18 mars 2019, il n\u2019y aurait aucun doute que l\u2019appelant aurait pu reporter le gain en capital dont il est question.\n[17] Une cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019Agence de Revenu du Canada est que le contribuable doit payer de l\u2019imp\u00f4t malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a fait aucune vente. Ce qui, selon ses circonstances financi\u00e8res, pourrait lui poser des probl\u00e8mes de liquidit\u00e9s.

Le paragraphe r\u00e9pute une disposition.\n[24] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 45(1)b) s\u2019applique quand, d\u00e8s l\u2019acquisition, le bien doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 aux deux fins. Ce paragraphe a pour effet de r\u00e9partir le co\u00fbt d\u2019acquisition entre les deux fins.\n[25] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 45(1)c) r\u00e9pute une disposition quand il y a un changement relatif du pourcentage d\u2019utilisation du bien pour chaque fin.[5]\n[26] Les paragraphes 45(2) et (3) permettent au contribuable de choisir de remettre \u00e0 plus tard des dispositions r\u00e9put\u00e9es dans certaines circonstances. Le paragraphe 45(2) n\u2019a pas de pertinence pour cette instance.\n[27] La question cl\u00e9 pourrait se r\u00e9sumer ainsi. Est-ce que la phrase :\n\u00ab le contribuable qui cesse \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb\ndoit \u00eatre comprise comme si elle se lisait :\n\u00ab le contribuable qui cesse \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis exclusivement \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb ?\n[28] Je peux comprendre qu\u2019\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue on puisse lire la phrase \u00ab le contribuable qui cesse \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb comme s\u2019appliquant uniquement dans les circonstances o\u00f9 le bien a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis exclusivement dans le but de gagner un revenu, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la situation d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 45(1)a)(ii).\n[29] Entre autres, le fait que les alin\u00e9as 45(1)a) et c) traite s\u00e9par\u00e9ment du changement d\u2019une seule fin \u00e0 l\u2019autre seule fin et du changement de la proportion d\u2019utilisation pour chacune des fins, respectivement, pourrait laisser croire que le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pr\u00e9vu de parler s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de ces deux situations \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du paragraphe 45(3) si son intention \u00e9tait de permettre le choix au paragraphe 45(3) dans les deux situations.\n[30] Quand on consid\u00e8re l\u2019\u00e9conomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019article 45, pour les raisons suivantes, je suis satisfait que le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi s\u2019applique \u00e9galement dans la situation factuelle de cet appel.\n[31] Premi\u00e8rement, tandis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de s\u00e9parer les alin\u00e9as 45(1)a) et c), car les cons\u00e9quences en termes des effets des deux types de dispositions r\u00e9put\u00e9es sont diff\u00e9rentes, une telle s\u00e9paration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire en r\u00e9digeant le paragraphe 45(3) parce que la cons\u00e9quence est tout simplement de remettre \u00e0 plus tard la disposition dans les deux cas.\n[32] Je note que le paragraphe 45(3) n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 45(1)a); le texte du paragraphe commence avec les mots : \u00ab Malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe (1)\u2026 \u00bb\n[33] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019objectif du paragraphe 45(3) quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 en 1985 \u00e9tait de permettre le report de dispositions r\u00e9put\u00e9es d\u2019un bien r\u00e9sidentiel quand ce bien devenait une r\u00e9sidence principale et que le paragraphe 45(4) ne s\u2019appliquait pas.[6]\n[34] Bien que les notes techniques parlent en termes d\u2019un bien immeuble r\u00e9sidentiel, il n\u2019y a rien qui sugg\u00e8re que les amendements cherchaient \u00e0 exclure la conversion d\u2019une partie du bien, par exemple la moiti\u00e9 d\u2019un duplex.\n[35] Une interpr\u00e9tation qui exclut le changement d\u2019usage partiel est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019objectif recherch\u00e9 quand le paragraphe 45(3) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9.[7]\n[36] Troisi\u00e8mement, une fois que le contribuable a cess\u00e9 de louer le haut de l\u2019immeuble je ne vois pas comment on pourrait dire qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser le bien en vue de gagner un revenu l\u2019immeuble en question.

Son revenu est compos\u00e9 de prestations de retraite et, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2015 seulement, de certains revenus provenant du REER.\n[8] En mars 2017, le ministre a \u00e9tabli les cotisations pour les cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition pour lesquelles des d\u00e9clarations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces cotisations. C\u2019\u00e9tait sans doute en raison de l\u2019imp\u00f4t retenu par les payeurs des r\u00e9gimes de retraite et sur les paiements du REER, en plus des cr\u00e9dits personnels, qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait payable.\n[9] En f\u00e9vrier 2018, le ministre a \u00e9tabli des cotisations pour versement tardif des retenues d\u2019imp\u00f4t des non-r\u00e9sidents de la partie XIII pour les cinq ann\u00e9es en cause.\n[10] Le montant des cotisations figure dans la colonne de droite du tableau au paragraphe 18 de l\u2019affidavit d\u2019Elaine Armstrong-Kyne.\n[11] Comme on peut le voir dans le tableau, ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s pour chaque ann\u00e9e en d\u00e9terminant la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t applicable des non-r\u00e9sidents[1] sur les paiements de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et en d\u00e9duisant les montants qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 la source. Je d\u00e9signe ces montants retenus comme les \u00ab retenues suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb.\n[12] L\u2019appelant s\u2019est d\u00fbment oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ces cotisations, et le ministre les a ult\u00e9rieurement confirm\u00e9es, sauf pour ce qui est de l\u2019exercice fiscal 2011.\n[13] Pour l\u2019exercice fiscal 2011, le ministre a admis que le contribuable avait r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada jusqu\u2019au mois d\u2019octobre et a recalcul\u00e9 la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t en cons\u00e9quence. Ce nouveau calcul \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019avantage du contribuable dans la mesure o\u00f9 la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t des non-r\u00e9sidents pour 2011 avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e pour toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[14] Rien dans la preuve ne m\u2019a convaincu que le ministre avait commis une erreur dans le calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[15] L\u2019objet de l\u2019article 217 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est d\u2019\u00e9viter que certains particuliers non-r\u00e9sidents ne se trouvent dans une posture qui est, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, plus d\u00e9favorable que s\u2019ils \u00e9taient encore r\u00e9sidents.\n[16] Compte tenu des sources de revenus de l\u2019appelant, s\u2019il avait fait le choix au moment opportun de tirer parti de l\u2019option pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 de payer les retenues suppl\u00e9mentaires exig\u00e9es. Ce r\u00e9sultat tient au fait que, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette option permet au contribuable de conserver les d\u00e9ductions habituelles.\n[17] L\u2019article 217 est facultatif, parce qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9savantageux pour certains contribuables non-r\u00e9sidents de choisir cette option, compte tenu de leur situation.\n[18] Malheureusement, l\u2019article 217 oblige l\u2019appelant \u00e0 produire, dans les six mois suivant la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, une d\u00e9claration de revenus en vertu de la partie I et \u00e0 faire, dans cette d\u00e9claration, le choix pour que l\u2019article 217 s\u2019applique pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e[2].\n[19] Cela signifie que l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb produire sa d\u00e9claration et faire un choix pour la derni\u00e8re des ann\u00e9es en cause, \u00e0 savoir 2015, au plus tard le 30 juin 2016.\n[20] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9clarations pour toutes les ann\u00e9es en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 20 juillet 2016, il \u00e9tait alors d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop tard pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, les cotisations pour ces ann\u00e9es sont correctes en fait et en droit et il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019annuler les cotisations.\n[22] Passons \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant sur les nombreuses difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9es afin d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019information sur la marche \u00e0 suivre et aux arguments qu\u2019il a invoqu\u00e9s qui reposent sur la Charte des droits du contribuable.\n[23] J\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle il a eu de grandes difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 obtenir de l\u2019information, il y avait des retards et l\u2019information fournie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toujours utile.\n[24] Cependant, en d\u00e9pit de son nom, la Charte des droits du contribuable n\u2019est pas une loi et ne conf\u00e8re pas de droits l\u00e9gaux. Ce document repr\u00e9sente plut\u00f4t un id\u00e9al et il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de lui donner un autre nom.\n[25] Notre cour n\u2019exerce qu\u2019une comp\u00e9tence limit\u00e9e et l\u2019essentiel de sa comp\u00e9tence consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les cotisations sont correctes en fonction de faits pertinents \u00e0 la loi applicable; elle peut confirmer ou modifier les cotisations, mais sa d\u00e9cision ne peut pas prendre d\u2019autres facteurs en consid\u00e9ration.\n[26] En cons\u00e9quence, toutes les difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant ne sont pas pertinentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que je dois prendre.\n[27] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 des graves difficult\u00e9s occasionn\u00e9es par les cotisations pour lui et son \u00e9pouse.\n[28] Bien que l\u2019appelant semble se trouver dans une situation extr\u00eamement d\u00e9licate compte tenu du montant exigible par rapport \u00e0 son revenu, je ne peux pas en tenir compte pour les besoins de la d\u00e9cision devant \u00eatre prise.\n[29] Toutefois, pour ce qui est des difficult\u00e9s, il existe des dispositions qui permettent au ministre de renoncer aux int\u00e9r\u00eats et aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s dans certaines circonstances; voir le paragraphe 220(3.1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Je suis heureux de constater que le ministre a renonc\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re proactive aux int\u00e9r\u00eats pour une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e en raison des retards survenus pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[30] L\u2019appelant peut certainement demander \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de lui accorder un all\u00e8gement suppl\u00e9mentaire aux termes de cette disposition. Ce tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour traiter ces questions[3].\n[31] Toutefois, une limite de dix ans s\u2019applique pour une remise; les demandes doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les dix ann\u00e9es civiles suivant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. L\u2019appelant peut obtenir d\u2019autres renseignements sur la mani\u00e8re dont le ministre traite ces demandes en consultant la circulaire d\u2019information IC07-1R1 Dispositions d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour les contribuables de l\u2019ARC; le formulaire RC4288 Demande d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour les contribuables contient aussi de l\u2019information.\n[32] Avant de conclure, je voudrais faire remarquer que, compte tenu des objectifs de l\u2019article 217, il est \u00e9tonnant de voir qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 apr\u00e8s le 30 juin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile suivante.\n[33] L\u2019appelant correspond parfaitement au profil du contribuable cens\u00e9 tirer parti de l\u2019article 217.\n[34] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, perdre la possibilit\u00e9 de faire ce choix a eu d\u2019importantes r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives pour l\u2019appelant.\n[35] Les retenues d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es par les payeurs des prestations de retraite de l\u2019appelant et sur les paiements du REER de l\u2019appelant auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes pour couvrir la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de l\u2019appelant s\u2019il avait pu se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019article 217. \u00c0 aucun moment, les fonds publics n\u2019auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 contribution.\n[36] Dans ces conditions, j\u2019ai du mal \u00e0 concevoir quel serait le pr\u00e9judice s\u2019il y avait un moyen de proroger le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 dans des circonstances comme celles de l\u2019appelant[4].\n[37] Ce d\u00e9lai relativement court est aussi surprenant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019un particulier qui omet de r\u00e9clamer quelque chose pourra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement se rattraper en d\u00e9posant une objection. Ce particulier dispose toujours d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019au moins un an \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production[5].\n[38] C\u2019est \u00e9galement \u00e9tonnant, puisque le contribuable peut pour bon nombre de choses tenter de persuader le ministre d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation, avec son consentement, pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix ans[6].\n[39] Les d\u00e9cideurs politiques et le Parlement pourraient examiner s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019apporter des modifications afin d\u2019accorder un d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 ou de donner au ministre la possibilit\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai[7].\n[40] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 22e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024.\n\u00ab G.

CONTEXTE\n[1] L\u2019appelante, Mme Diane Panneton, en appelle \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) en vertu de l\u2019article 160 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C (1985), ch.1 (5e suppl.) (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) par laquelle le ministre r\u00e9clame \u00e0 Mme Panneton la somme de 131 309,38 $.\n[2] Selon le ministre, le conjoint de Mme Panneton, M.

QUESTION EN LITIGE ET CONCESSIONS DES PARTIES\n[6] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 30 novembre 2023 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour, et confirm\u00e9e par les parties au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, les parties ont indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour que la seule question que la Cour doit trancher est la suivante :\nEst-ce que M. Charbonneau, le d\u00e9biteur fiscal, a transf\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00ab directement ou indirectement, au moyen d\u2019une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb, la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1) ?\n[7] Les parties ont convenu que les autres conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) sont remplies (voir La Reine c. Livingston 2008 CAF 89 [Livingston] (au par. 17):\ni)M. Charbonneau a une dette fiscale d\u2019un montant au moins \u00e9gal \u00e0 la somme de 141 109,38 $ au moment des transferts s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant de 2002 \u00e0 2004;\nii)La b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des transferts, soit Mme Panneton, est la conjointe de M. Charbonneau tout au long de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant de 2002 \u00e0 2004, et l\u2019est encore en date de l\u2019audience;\niii)La juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s totalisant 141 109,38 $ exc\u00e8de la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie donn\u00e9e par Mme Panneton, soit la somme de 9 800 $.\nIV. CONCLUSION ET DISPOSITIF\n[8] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1). Ainsi, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s selon le tarif B de l\u2019annexe II des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale).\nV. FAITS\n5.1 T\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau\nGAM\n[9] En 1995, M. Charbonneau a constitu\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 9029-4802 Qu\u00e9bec inc., faisant affaire, entre autres, sous le nom Groupe Action Motivation (\u00ab GAM \u00bb).\n[10] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2008, les administrateurs de GAM \u00e9taient M. Charbonneau et Mme Panneton, Mme Panneton \u00e9tait la secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re et M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident.\n[11] Jusqu\u2019en 2009, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait le seul actionnaire de GAM. En 2009, Mme Panneton a acquis les actions d\u00e9tenues alors par M. Charbonneau dans le capital de GAM.\n[12] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2008, GAM offrait environ 150 \u00e0 200 formations en entreprise par ann\u00e9e (incluant du mentorat et des conf\u00e9rences), n\u2019avait pas d\u2019employ\u00e9 et engageait environ 23 pigistes par ann\u00e9e. M. Charbonneau veillait au bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019organisation ; plus particuli\u00e8rement, il s\u2019occupait de la livraison des mandats, du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires et du contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des services. Quant \u00e0 Mme Panneton, elle s\u2019occupait des t\u00e2ches de secr\u00e9tariat, faisait des constats quant \u00e0 la livraison de la formation et conseillait l\u2019organisation, sans toutefois recevoir de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de GAM.\n[13] La client\u00e8le de GAM \u00e9tait panqu\u00e9b\u00e9coise ; les sources de revenus de GAM provenaient des services de mentorat et de formation en entreprise. Les sommes factur\u00e9es aux clients en paiement des services rendus \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au compte bancaire de GAM, et non pas au compte bancaire personnel de M. Charbonneau.\n[14] Selon M. Charbonneau, GAM aurait encouru les d\u00e9penses pour les fins suivantes dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise: le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires, les voyages et d\u00e9placements, les loyers, la bureautique et papeterie, et les am\u00e9liorations locatives du local situ\u00e9 au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence dont Mme Panneton \u00e9tait la seule propri\u00e9taire (la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb). M. Charbonneau habitait \u00e9galement la r\u00e9sidence.\nPAM\n[15] En 1998, M. Charbonneau a constitu\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Productions Action Motivation inc. (\u00ab PAM \u00bb). PAM a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise sur pied en vue de faire la production de vid\u00e9os sur la motivation.\n[16] Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, vers 2004, PAM aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour recruter des investisseurs, cr\u00e9er un club d\u2019investissement et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des placements boursiers. Ainsi, un certain M. Andr\u00e9 Cloutier se serait joint \u00e0 PAM pour recruter des investisseurs.\n[17] Selon M. Charbonneau, M. Cloutier aurait occup\u00e9 un bureau situ\u00e9 dans le sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, ni M. Charbonneau ni Mme Panneton n\u2019exer\u00e7aient de fonctions aupr\u00e8s de PAM, sauf pour M. Charbonneau qui viellait \u00e0 d\u00e9poser les contributions re\u00e7ues des investisseurs au compte bancaire de PAM.\n[18] Selon les d\u00e9clarations annuelles de PAM pour les ann\u00e9es 2001 et 2002, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire et administrateur. Selon la d\u00e9claration annuelle pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, M. Cloutier \u00e9tait actionnaire, administrateur et vice-pr\u00e9sident, et M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait actionnaire, administrateur et pr\u00e9sident.\n[19] Toutefois, selon M. Charbonneau, M. Cloutier ne serait devenu actionnaire de PAM que vers l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004, puisqu\u2019en 2003, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire et administrateur.\n[20] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 et 2004, PAM n\u2019aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun revenu mais aurait encouru les d\u00e9penses pour les fins suivantes dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise: les loyers, les voyages d\u2019affaires, la bureautique et les am\u00e9liorations locatives du local situ\u00e9 au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence de Mme Panneton.\nLa r\u00e9sidence et les travaux\n[21] La r\u00e9sidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par Mme Panneton en mai 2002 au prix de 215 000 $. Les travaux y auraient d\u00e9but\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003.\n[22] M. Charbonneau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tendue des am\u00e9liorations locatives qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence : l\u2019installation d\u2019une salle d\u2019eau, de planchers et de cloisons au sous-sol, ainsi que la construction d\u2019une salle de formation au garage et l\u2019\u00e9largissement du stationnement pour quatre \u00e0 six voitures.\n[23] \u00c9galement, selon M. Charbonneau, des d\u00e9penses auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues pour l\u2019am\u00e9nagement d\u2019un pavillon de jardin situ\u00e9 sur le terrain de la r\u00e9sidence pour y tenir des r\u00e9unions professionnelles.\n5.2 T\u00e9moignage de M. Nadeau\n[24] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002, 2003 et 2004, M. Charbonneau ne d\u00e9tenait aucun compte bancaire en son nom personnel.\n[25] Selon l\u2019imprim\u00e9 \u00ab option C \u00bb de l\u2019ARC concernant M. Charbonneau, ce dernier aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un revenu d\u2019entreprise de 23 930 $ en 2002, et aucun revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2007 (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 6, Copie de l\u2019imprim\u00e9 \u00ab Option C \u00bb de l\u2019ARC pour M. Charbonneau, relatif aux ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002 \u00e0 2007 [en liasse]).\n[26] Vers l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, l\u2019ARC a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de M. Charbonneau au niveau personnel pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002 \u00e0 2007. Suite \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification, l\u2019ARC a \u00e9tabli une cotisation par la m\u00e9thode de l\u2019avoir net (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 7 : rapport de v\u00e9rification de M. L\u00e9tourneau (ARC) pour la cotisation sous-jacente).\n[27] Suite \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification, un montant total de 1 280 532 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Charbonneau pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2004, alors qu\u2019un montant total de 70 503 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Charbonneau pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2007.\n[28] Les montants des retraits bancaires au compte de PAM totalisant 1 176 342 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s au revenu de M. Charbonneau selon le paragraphe 15(1).\n[29] Selon M. Nadeau, des sommes totalisant 1,5 M$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au compte bancaire de PAM, et en sont ressorties. Puisqu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces sommes provenaient d\u2019une personne autre que M. Charbonneau, ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 sur ces sommes.\n[30] Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, M. Nadeau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que certaines sommes provenaient probablement des investisseurs. M. Charbonneau s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 aux cotisations, et a fait faillite en d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n[31] En ce qui concerne la cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Panneton, M. Nadeau indique que les motifs d\u2019opposition \u00e9taient que les sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Panneton ne provenaient pas de M. Charbonneau et que certains montants avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9s sous le paragraphe 15(1).\n[32] Toutefois, selon M. Nadeau, les montants cotis\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 15(1) ne provenaient ni de GAM ni de PAM, mais d\u2019une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nVI. TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES\n6.1 La th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelante [33] Selon l\u2019appelante, un appauvrissement du patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur fiscal est essentiel pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un transfert aux fins de l\u2019article 160.\n[34] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y aurait eu aucun transfert direct ou indirect de biens provenant du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 celui de Mme Panneton, puisque ce sont les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, et non pas M. Charbonneau, qui ont transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes provenant de leurs fonds propres au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, aux fins de la construction d\u2019am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence.\n[35] Compte tenu que PAM et GAM ne sont pas des d\u00e9bitrices fiscales, Mme Panneton ne peut donc \u00eatre tenue responsable des dettes fiscales de son conjoint, M. Charbonneau. En outre, on ne pourrait conclure qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de quelques biens que ce soit du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau au patrimoine de Mme Panneton, puisque le patrimoine de M. Charbonneau ne se serait pas appauvri par l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques par PAM et GAM au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton.\n[36] \u00c9galement, au soutien de sa th\u00e8se, l\u2019appelante indique que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM sont des personnes morales ayant un patrimoine distinct de celui de M. Charbonneau, qui ont la pleine jouissance de leurs droits civils (articles 301 et suivants du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, RLRQ c. CCQ-1991 (\u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb)).\n[37] De plus, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu un transfert indirect de la somme de 141 109,38 $ de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton, puisque M. Charbonneau n\u2019a pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ces sommes \u00e0 PAM et GAM, pour qu\u2019ensuite PAM et GAM les transf\u00e8rent \u00e0 Mme Panneton. En effet, selon l\u2019appelante, la preuve aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que PAM et GAM avaient des sources de revenus qui leur \u00e9taient propres.\n[38] Finalement, il serait contradictoire pour le ministre d\u2019avoir cotis\u00e9 M. Charbonneau pour appropriation de fonds provenant de PAM et GAM en vertu du paragraphe 15(1), pour maintenant pr\u00e9tendre que les fonds aux comptes bancaires de PAM et GAM constituent des fonds propres \u00e0 M. Charbonneau.\n6.2 La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[39] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il y aurait eu transfert direct ou indirect de biens de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1), de sorte que Mme Panneton est responsable des dettes fiscales de M. Charbonneau conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre. Pour appuyer sa th\u00e8se, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soumis deux th\u00e9ories \u00e0 la Cour.\n[40] Selon la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en utilisant les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, M. Charbonneau aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton (ou pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice) provenant de ses propres fonds, ce qui fait en sorte qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens aux fins du paragraphe 160(1).\n[41] Les faits suivants supporteraient cette conclusion.\n[42] Tout d\u2019abord, PAM et GAM n\u2019ont exerc\u00e9 aucune activit\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2001 jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 2004.\n[43] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que PAM n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu et n\u2019a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9pense au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2003. Quant \u00e0 GAM, elle a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 peu de revenus. M. Charbonneau n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2007.\n[44] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les suppos\u00e9es am\u00e9liorations locatives apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une entreprise exploit\u00e9e par GAM et PAM, puisque les paiements faits par GAM et PAM auraient servi \u00e0 r\u00e9nover la r\u00e9sidence.\n[45] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau est parfois vague, contradictoire et int\u00e9ress\u00e9, et n\u2019est donc pas cr\u00e9dible. L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande \u00e0 la Cour de tirer une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative de l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton et de M. Cloutier \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des divers ch\u00e8ques ne supporte pas la th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelante.\n[47] Finalement, la preuve aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau ne d\u00e9tenait aucun compte bancaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des transferts, soit entre 2002 et 2004. Il \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de GAM et l\u2019actionnaire unique ou majoritaire de PAM. Il avait le contr\u00f4le des deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, ainsi que des comptes bancaires de celles-ci. Il est donc fort probable qu\u2019il utilisait les comptes bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait ses comptes bancaires personnels.\n[48] Toutefois, si la Cour n\u2019est pas convaincue par la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que M. Charbonneau a effectu\u00e9 un transfert de la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement \u2026de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[49] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Charbonneau aurait pris des dispositions pour que PAM et GAM fassent des paiements aux tiers pour la r\u00e9novation de la r\u00e9sidence, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton. Il faut donc conclure que le patrimoine de M. Charbonneau s\u2019est appauvri de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[50] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour doit appliquer les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s des affaires Canada c. Kieboom [1992] 3 C.F. 488 (CAF) [Kieboom] et Strachan c. La Reine, 2013 CCI 362 [Strachan].\nVII. DISCUSSION\n7.1 Transfert au sens du paragraphe 160(1) : la jurisprudence pertinente\n[51] Selon la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54 [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601 [Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco] (au par. 10) :\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s\u2019harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble.\n[52] Dans ce m\u00eame arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rappel\u00e9 que la complexit\u00e9 de certaines dispositions de la Loi devait inciter les tribunaux \u00e0 accorder une importance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation textuelle, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer l\u2019uniformit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 requises pour les contribuables (Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, aux par. 11 et 12).\n[53] L\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) \u00ab \u2026 d\u00e9pend dans une mesure particuli\u00e8rement importante de l\u2019objet\u2026 \u00bb de ce paragraphe, qui est \u00ab \u2026 d\u2019emp\u00eacher un contribuable de transf\u00e9rer ses biens \u00e0 son conjoint \u2026 afin de faire \u00e9chec aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le ministre pour percevoir l\u2019argent qui lui est d\u00fb \u00bb (voir Livingston, au par. 18, citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland c. Canada, 98 DTC 6358 (CAF) [Medland]).\n[54] R\u00e9cemment, dans Eyeball Networks Inc. c. La Reine, 2021 CAF 17 (au par. 60), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rappel\u00e9 l\u2019objet du paragraphe 160(1) :\n[44] Comme le confirme notre Cour, le paragraphe 160(1) a pour objet de supprimer pour le fisc toute vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un transfert de biens entre personnes ayant un lien de d\u00e9pendance fond\u00e9 sur une contrepartie inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u2026\n[55] Comme le d\u00e9montre la jurisprudence mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessous, une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de cette disposition est de mise, permettant de respecter l\u2019objet de celle-ci, de m\u00eame que le texte de la disposition et le contexte de la Loi.\n[56] Tout d\u2019abord, le paragraphe 160(1) est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans des termes tr\u00e8s larges. Ce paragraphe vise toutes situations o\u00f9, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, un d\u00e9biteur fiscal transf\u00e8re des biens \u00e0 son conjoint (ou autres personnes vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 160(1)), si ce transfert venait \u00ab faire \u00e9chec aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le ministre pour percevoir l'argent qui lui est d\u00fb \u00bb (voir Livingston, au par. 18, citant Medland).\n[57] L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u00ab directement ou indirectement, au moyen d\u2019une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb indique \u00e9galement cette volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019inclure un vaste \u00e9ventail de transactions \u00e0 la port\u00e9e d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur fiscal pour transf\u00e9rer des biens \u00e0 une autre personne vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1).\n[58] En outre, la version fran\u00e7aise du paragraphe 160(1) emploie l\u2019expression \u00ab [l]orsqu\u2019une personne a\u2026 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens\u2026 \u00bb, et non pas \u00ab des biens lui appartenant \u00bb. La terminologie utilis\u00e9e indique qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019exigence que le conjoint (ou l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des personnes vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 160(1)) re\u00e7oive les m\u00eames biens que ceux qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le d\u00e9biteur fiscal. La version anglaise du paragraphe 160(1) utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab [w]here a person has \u2026 transferred property\u2026 \u00bb qui est au m\u00eame effet.\n[59] La Cour en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion \u00e9galement en consid\u00e9rant d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi qui emploie un langage diff\u00e9rent de celui utilis\u00e9 aux fins du paragraphe 160(1). Par exemple, pour le calcul du gain en capital provenant de la disposition d\u2019un bien, le paragraphe 39(1) pr\u00e9voit que pour les fins de la Loi, le gain en capital \u00e0 inclure dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable doit provenir de la disposition \u00ab d\u2019un bien lui appartenant \u00bb. La version anglaise du paragraphe 39(1) utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab any property of the taxpayer \u00bb. Pour ce qui est de la valeur des biens \u00e0 inclure \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire aux fins de la Loi, il est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 que ce sera leur co\u00fbt d\u2019acquisition pour le contribuable (en anglais, on utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab cost at which the taxpayer acquired the property \u00bb.)\n[60] \u00c9galement, la jurisprudence a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb de fa\u00e7on large (voir Damis Properties Inc. c. La Reine, 2021 CCI 24 [Damis Properties], aux par. 119 \u00e0 131, d\u00e9cision renvers\u00e9e en appel, mais pas sur ce point, voir Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157). Ainsi, dans Damis Properties, pour conclure de cette fa\u00e7on, la Cour a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb retrouv\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat David Fasken Estate c. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] Ex CR 580 (aux pages 591-592) [Fasken Estate].\n[61] Les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de Fasken Estate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Kieboom qui devait d\u00e9terminer le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab \u2026a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens, directement ou indirectement, par un acte de fiducie ou par tout autre moyen\u2026 \u00bb, dans le cadre de l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles d\u2019attribution pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi, soit une expression tr\u00e8s similaire \u00e0 celle retrouv\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1).\n[62] Dans cette affaire, M. Kieboom avait fait en sorte que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mette des actions \u00e0 sa conjointe pour une contrepartie inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande, faisant diminuer sa propre participation au capital de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu un transfert indirect par M. Kieboom \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse :\n18 \u2026A mon avis, l'expression \u00ab transfert de biens \u00bb est employ\u00e9e dans cette disposition dans un sens plut\u00f4t large. Les deux substantifs de cette expression sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et n'ont pas de sens technique. Quant au mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb, le lord juge James a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 7 de l'arr\u00eat Gathercole v. Smith (1880-81), 17 Ch. D. 1 (C.A.) que le substantif \u00ab transfert \u00bb est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab l\u2019un des termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que l'on puisse employer \u00bb. Le lord juge Lush a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [\u00e0 la page 9] que le mot \u00ab transf\u00e9rable \u00bb comprend [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tout moyen par lequel un bien peut \u00eatre transmis d'une personne \u00e0 une autre \u00bb.\n19 Le pr\u00e9sident Thorson, se fondant sur les d\u00e9finitions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es dans le jugement Fasken, David v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] R.C.\u00c9. 580, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 592:\n[TRADUCTION] Le mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb n'est pas un terme technique. Pour qu'il y ait transfert d'un bien d'un mari \u00e0 sa femme, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il soit fait selon une forme particuli\u00e8re, ni qu'il soit fait directement. Il suffit que le contribuable se d\u00e9partisse du bien et le remette \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il lui transmette le bien. Le moyen employ\u00e9 pour atteindre ce r\u00e9sultat, qu'il soit direct ou indirect, peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre appel\u00e9 un transfert.\n...\n21 Ainsi donc, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le contribuable a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 un bien \u00e0 sa femme en lui donnant une partie de sa participation dans sa compagnie. La participation de 40 % du capital-actions de sa compagnie qu'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme constituait de toute \u00e9vidence un bien. Sa participation dans sa compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite de 40 % et celle de sa femme a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e de 40 %. Le fait qu'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ce transfert de bien en faisant \u00e9mettre des actions par sa compagnie ne fait pas de diff\u00e9rence. Le paragraphe 74(1) s'applique aux transferts qui sont faits \u00ab directement ou indirectement \u00bb ou \u00ab par tout autre moyen que ce soit \u00bb. Le transfert, qui en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait indirect, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le contribuable a pris des dispositions pour que sa compagnie \u00e9mette des actions \u00e0 sa femme, constitue n\u00e9anmoins un transfert du mari \u00e0 la femme. \u2026\n[mes soulignements]\n[63] Dans Medland, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir si un particulier avait effectu\u00e9 un transfert \u00e0 sa conjointe au sens du paragraphe 160(1) en effectuant des remboursements de capital \u00e0 la banque \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une dette garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que grevant la r\u00e9sidence appartenant \u00e0 sa conjointe. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu transfert indirect au sens du paragraphe 160(1) :\n[15] Je suis d'avis que le juge de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t a eu raison de conclure que l'\u00e9poux de la demanderesse lui a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens indirectement en ce qui concerne la partie des paiements hypoth\u00e9caires imputables au principal de l'emprunt.\n[16] Le terme \" biens \" figurant dans le paragraphe 160(1) de la Loi, d\u00e9fini comme des \" biens de toute nature \", y compris \" de l'argent \", a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par lord Langdale9 comme [Traduction] \" celui des termes pouvant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s qui est le plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en ce qu'il indique et d\u00e9crit toute la gamme possible d'int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'une partie peut avoir.\"\n[17] Le terme \" transfert \" n'est pas d\u00e9fini dans la loi. Il a fait l'objet des remarques suivantes de la part du pr\u00e9sident Thorson de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada dans Estate of Fasken v. M.N.R.10\u2026\n\u2026\n[19] En appliquant l'expression [Traduction] \" transfert ... de biens \" du paragraphe 4(4) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t de guerre sur le revenu de 1917 \u00e0 ces faits, le juge Thorson a indiqu\u00e9 en fait que, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse en l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, lorsque le mari se d\u00e9partit d'un bien particulier, que ce m\u00eame bien soit d\u00e9volu \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse.\n[20] Les termes \" indirectement ... de toute autre fa\u00e7on \" figurant dans le paragraphe 160(1) de la Loi renvoient \u00e0 toute fa\u00e7on d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e dont un bien de quelque nature peut \u00eatre transmis d'une personne \u00e0 une autre. En l'esp\u00e8ce, lorsque M. Medland a effectu\u00e9 les paiements au cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, il a indiqu\u00e9 que cet argent devait \u00eatre imput\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de l'emprunt hypoth\u00e9caire grevant le bien sur lequel il n'avait plus d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Bien qu'il soit exact que le paragraphe 160(1) n'emploie pas les mots \" au profit de \" ni \" au nom de \" comme les paragraphes 15(1) ou 74.1(1) ou l'alin\u00e9a 224(1.1) de la Loi, la demanderesse ne nie pas que sa dette a diminu\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce aux paiements et que la valeur nette de son bien a augment\u00e9. La fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ce r\u00e9sultat consistait \u00e0 verser des montants \u00e0 la Banque que celle-ci imputait \u00e0 un emprunt hypoth\u00e9caire grevant une maison dont la demanderesse \u00e9tait l'unique propri\u00e9taire. Le paiement \u00e0 la Banque n'\u00e9tait qu'un moyen pour transmettre les fonds indirectement du mari \u00e0 la demanderesse.\n[21] L\u2019argument de la demanderesse portant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu transfert de biens parce que M. Medland s\u2019est d\u00e9parti d\u2019argent et que ces sommes n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es [physiquement] \u00e0 la demanderesse est sans fondement. [...]\n[mes soulignements]\n[64] Dans Strachan, la Cour devait d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019article 160 s\u2019appliquait aux transactions par lesquelles M. Strachan avait permis \u00e0 sa conjointe de souscrire \u00e0 des actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il avait la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une valeur moindre que la valeur marchande. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 avec approbation aux conclusions de Kieboom, la Cour a conclu ainsi:\n[38] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Strachan a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019une fa\u00e7on semblable : il lui a d\u2019abord donn\u00e9 95 p. 100, puis 98 p. 100, de sa participation au capital de Northside en lui permettant de souscrire 38 actions pour la somme de 38 000 $, puis 75 actions pour la somme de 75 000 $, en 2001 et en 2002 respectivement. J\u2019ai conclu que M. Strachan \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de Northside avant le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2004. Il a donc renonc\u00e9 aux droits se rattachant \u00e0 ses actions dans une m\u00eame proportion (c.-\u00e0-d. son droit de vote en tant qu\u2019actionnaire unique, son droit de recevoir 100 p. 100 des dividendes en cas de distribution et son droit de recevoir la totalit\u00e9 des biens restants de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en cas de dissolution). Le fait que M. Strachan a fait transf\u00e9rer les actions \u00e0 l\u2019appelante en faisant en sorte que Northside les \u00e9mette ne devrait faire aucune diff\u00e9rence.\n[65] Finalement, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence traitant du terme \u00ab transfert \u00bb et les d\u00e9cisions traitant du paragraphe 160(1), dont Kieboom et Medland, la Cour, dans l\u2019affaire Damis Properties, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on fort juste et appropri\u00e9e le droit applicable eu \u00e9gard au paragraphe 160(1):\n[130] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour constate que M. Kieboom a \u00ab pris des dispositions \u00bb pour que les op\u00e9rations constituent le transfert du bien de lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 et non d\u2019une condition dans le pr\u00e9ambule. Les mots \u00ab une personne a : [...] transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens [. . .] \u00bb appelant (sic) une d\u00e9termination objective de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Ces mots n\u2019exigent pas de d\u00e9terminer qui a provoqu\u00e9 ce qui s\u2019est produit.\n[131] Ensuite, la Cour rejette la classification \u00e9troite des biens en cause par M. Kieboom comme \u00e9tant des actions particuli\u00e8res de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cela m\u2019indique que plut\u00f4t que de tenter de retracer un bien particulier, il faut consid\u00e9rer toutes les circonstances et d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du bien d\u2019une personne et l\u2019augmentation du bien d\u2019une autre personne. Telle est l\u2019approche consacr\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision Kieboom et par l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland.\n[mes soulignements]\n[66] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, au regard de la jurisprudence, pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un transfert selon le paragraphe 160(1), la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton.\n7.2 Transfert fait \u00ab indirectement \u2026de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb par M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton, au sens du paragraphe 160(1) [67] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par les parties qu\u2019entre le 4 novembre 2002 et le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, GAM a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques de son compte bancaire de la caisse populaire Desjardins de La Prairie (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 22, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de GAM [en liasse]) totalisant 83 392,27 $, en paiement \u00e0 des tiers pour divers biens et services.\n[68] Il n\u2019est \u00e9galement pas contest\u00e9 par les parties qu\u2019entre le 1er mars 2003 et le 16 janvier 2004, PAM a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques de son compte bancaire de la caisse populaire de St-Lambert (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 16, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de PAM [en liasse]) totalisant 57 717,11 $, en paiement \u00e0 des tiers pour divers biens et services.\n[69] De plus, l\u2019appelante convient que les paiements faits aux tiers par GAM, totalisant 83 392,27 $, et par PAM, totalisant 57 717,11 $, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, puisque les paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en contrepartie de travaux effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence appartenant \u00e0 Mme Panneton en part enti\u00e8re.\n[70] Ainsi, les parties conviennent qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton. Ce principe d\u00e9coule de l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland (aux par. 20-21), principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 par notre Cour dans Goldberg c. La Reine, 2003 DTC 190 (CCI) (au par. 14).\n[71] La Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ de M. Charbonneau, le d\u00e9biteur fiscal, \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[72] En appliquant les principes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par la jurisprudence, pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[73] En effet, en examinant toutes les circonstances entourant les transactions, la Cour conclut, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton. Cons\u00e9quemment, et vu les concessions faites par les parties, toutes les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) sont remplies en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[74] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que GAM et PAM n\u2019ont re\u00e7u aucune contrepartie en \u00e9change des paiements faits aux tiers totalisant 141 109,38 $.\n[75] La Cour ne retient pas la version des faits de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les sommes vers\u00e9es par GAM et PAM ont servi \u00e0 payer pour des am\u00e9liorations locatives apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de GAM et PAM qui y exer\u00e7aient leurs activit\u00e9s.\n[76] La Cour conclut plut\u00f4t que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton. De plus, puisque les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9 des paiements \u00e0 des tiers totalisant 141 109,38 $ sans recevoir la moindre contrepartie, il est donc appropri\u00e9 pour la Cour de conclure que le patrimoine de GAM et PAM a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalent et d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que la valeur des actions de GAM et PAM d\u00e9tenues par l\u2019actionnaire unique, M. Charbonneau, a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalant.\n[77] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 par notre Cour dans Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage s\u2019\u00e9value de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[23] En mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je peux tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses que comporte le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins, y compris les incoh\u00e9rences internes (si le t\u00e9moignage change pendant que le t\u00e9moin est \u00e0 la barre ou s'il diverge du t\u00e9moignage rendu \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable), les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences externes (soit lorsque le t\u00e9moignage est incompatible avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ind\u00e9pendants que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9s). Il m\u2019est ensuite loisible d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attitude et le comportement du t\u00e9moin. Troisi\u00e8mement, je peux rechercher si le t\u00e9moin a des raisons de rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur. Enfin, je peux prendre en compte la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve. C\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que j\u2019ai toute latitude pour rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[78] Ainsi, pour \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, la Cour peut tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences, des faiblesses du t\u00e9moignage, de m\u00eame que l\u2019attitude du t\u00e9moin, et peut rechercher si le t\u00e9moin aurait des raisons d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur, et consid\u00e9rer la teneur de la preuve. La Cour peut accepter la totalit\u00e9, une partie ou seulement certaines parties du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, ou totalement rejeter le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin (voir Ha c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 271, au par. 21).\n[79] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau au sujet des am\u00e9liorations locatives est peu cr\u00e9dible, puisqu\u2019entre autres, cet argument n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 avant l\u2019audition de cet appel. Cet argument n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 au cours des discussions avec l\u2019ARC, ainsi qu\u2019au cours du processus d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation en appel devant cette Cour. L\u2019avis d\u2019opposition d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 2, Copie de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition de l\u2019appelante pour la cotisation portant le num\u00e9ro 4870340) ne mentionne aucunement l\u2019existence de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives.\n[80] \u00c9galement, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel log\u00e9 par Mme Panneton n\u2019en fait aucunement mention. L\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re qu\u2019aux paiements effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 des tiers par GAM, en pr\u00e9cisant que les ch\u00e8ques \u00ab \u2026 correspondent \u00e0 des sommes que l\u2019appelante s\u2019est elle-m\u00eame vers\u00e9e via sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en raison des sommes qui lui \u00e9taient alors dues par cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (voir le par. 10 de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour le 28 mars 2019). L\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne fait aucune mention de PAM.\n[81] \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour tire une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative de l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton \u00e0 l\u2019audition de son appel devant la Cour et conclut que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019aurait pas aid\u00e9 sa cause ou aurait m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de M. Charbonneau (voir Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. c. La Reine, 2011 CAF 79, au par. 14).\n[82] L\u2019appelante a tent\u00e9 de justifier l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton \u00e0 l\u2019audition de son appel pour le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audition consid\u00e9rant que la seule question en litige \u00e9tait de savoir si M. Charbonneau avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens \u00e0 celle-ci. La Cour consid\u00e8re cette justification tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9e et ne la retient pas, et en tire donc une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Panneton aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fort utile pour permettre \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue des travaux effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, \u00e0 savoir si des am\u00e9liorations locatives avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence ou encore, si des r\u00e9novations importantes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence.\n[83] De plus, M. Charbonneau n\u2019a fourni aucun \u00e9tat financier d\u00e9montrant l\u2019existence de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de GAM et PAM.\n[84] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve une copie du registre Cortax maintenu par l\u2019ARC reprenant la d\u00e9claration de revenus et les annexes de GAM pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant les 31 janvier 2003 et 31 janvier 2004 (voir les pi\u00e8ces I- 1, Cortax pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 et I-2, Cortax pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004). Le bilan n\u2019indique aucune immobilisation au titre des am\u00e9liorations locatives, les seules immobilisations y apparaissant \u00e9tant le mat\u00e9riel informatique et les logiciels (co\u00fbt : 14 388 $), de m\u00eame que les machines, meubles et accessoires (co\u00fbt : 1 449 $).\n[85] En ce qui concerne PAM, elle n\u2019a pas produit de d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002, 2003 et 2004, comme elle devait le faire. Ce n\u2019est que dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification de M. Charbonneau ayant d\u00e9but\u00e9 vers 2009 que les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de PAM pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2004 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites par M. Charbonneau. PAM n\u2019a produit aucun bilan, n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu et n\u2019a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9pense.\n[86] Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 facile pour M. Charbonneau, contr\u00f4lant les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, de produire de tels documents. La Cour en vient donc \u00e0 la conclusion que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives n\u2019existent pas et les paiements aux tiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s par PAM et GAM pour la r\u00e9novation de la r\u00e9sidence.\n[87] En effet, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. La r\u00e9sidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise en mai 2002 \u00e0 un prix de 215 000 $ et des sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es \u00e0 des tiers par GAM et PAM pour les travaux apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. Compte tenu des montants en jeu, il est plus probable que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, plut\u00f4t que des am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol pour les activit\u00e9s de GAM et PAM.\n[88] \u00c9galement, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de certains tiers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des paiements soul\u00e8ve des doutes quant \u00e0 la nature des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es. Cela semble plut\u00f4t indiquer que des r\u00e9novations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, et non pas des am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol de celle-ci pour les fins de l\u2019entreprise de PAM et GAM. Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Cour a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par exemple les paiements faits aux personnes tierces suivantes : Club piscine, C\u00e8dres experts, Sensation musicale Hi-Fi, \u00c9b\u00e9nisterie S.R. inc., et Cr\u00e9ations de L\u00e9gance inc. (voir pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 22, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de GAM [en liasse] et onglet 16, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de PAM [en liasse]).\n[89] En outre, pour les motifs suivants, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s GAM et PAM tout au long de la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9mis les ch\u00e8ques et effectu\u00e9 les paiements aux tiers, sans recevoir aucune contrepartie.\n[90] Ainsi, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, suite \u00e0 ces op\u00e9rations, il est donc appropri\u00e9 pour la Cour d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que la valeur des actions de GAM et PAM d\u00e9tenues par l\u2019actionnaire unique, M. Charbonneau, a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalant, et que M. Charbonneau s\u2019est donc d\u00e9parti de biens d\u2019une valeur totalisant 141 109,38 $.\n[91] En effet, en ce qui concerne GAM, l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques et les paiements aux tiers s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur la p\u00e9riode du 4 novembre 2002 au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de GAM de 1995 (moment de la constitution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9) jusqu\u2019en 2009.\n[92] En ce qui concerne PAM, l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques et les paiements aux tiers s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur la p\u00e9riode du 1er mars 2003 au 16 janvier 2004. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de PAM au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2003, incluant le mois de janvier 2004. Il est plus probable que M. Cloutier ne soit devenu actionnaire de PAM qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le mois de janvier 2004, soit apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis par PAM et les paiements aux tiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s. Tout d\u2019abord, M. Charbonneau a lui-m\u00eame t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Cloutier n\u2019\u00e9tait devenu actionnaire de PAM que vers 2004. En outre, il est plus probable que M. Cloutier n\u2019aurait pas permis que PAM \u00e9mette des ch\u00e8ques en paiement de biens ou services au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, sans contrepartie.\n[93] De plus, la valeur du patrimoine de Mme Panneton s\u2019est accrue d\u2019autant, puisque Mme Panneton n\u2019a vers\u00e9 aucune contrepartie pour les sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ pay\u00e9es par GAM et PAM aux tiers, \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice (sauf en ce qui concerne les loyers totalisant 9 800 $, tel qu\u2019admis par l\u2019intim\u00e9), et celle-ci a donc re\u00e7u un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e9quivalant.\n[94] Si de tels paiements n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s GAM et PAM, le fisc aurait pu saisir les actions des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9tenues par M. Charbonneau et liquider, entre autres, les comptes bancaires pour \u00e9ponger, du moins en partie, la dette fiscale de M. Charbonneau.\n[95] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que vu que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions ont une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte de celle de leurs actionnaires et administrateurs, la Cour ne pourrait conclure que M. Charbonneau a fait un transfert \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1), vu que la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les ch\u00e8ques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis aux tiers par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, et non pas par M. Charbonneau.\n[96] L\u2019appelante cite les articles 301 et suivants du C.c.Q. pour soutenir sa position. Les articles pertinents se lisent ainsi:\n301. Les personnes morales ont la pleine jouissance des droits civils.\n302. Les personnes morales sont titulaires d\u2019un patrimoine qui peut, dans la seule mesure pr\u00e9vue par la loi, faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une division ou d\u2019une affectation. Elles ont aussi des droits et obligations extrapatrimoniaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 leur nature.\n303. Les personnes morales ont la capacit\u00e9 requise pour exercer tous leurs droits, et les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des droits civils par les personnes physiques leur sont applicables, compte tenu des adaptations n\u00e9cessaires.\nElles n\u2019ont d\u2019autres incapacit\u00e9s que celles qui r\u00e9sultent de leur nature ou d\u2019une disposition expresse de la loi.\n[97] La Cour ne retient pas cet argument de l\u2019appelante, compte tenu de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il faut donner au mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb retrouv\u00e9 au paragraphe 160(1) et de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019en a fait la jurisprudence comme expliqu\u00e9e ci-dessus. Il est clair que le paragraphe 160(1) ne requiert pas que le m\u00eame bien soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur fiscal \u00e0 son conjoint (ou \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre personne vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1)) pour recevoir application.\n[98] La Cour conclut \u00e9galement, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton, vu que les paiements faits aux tiers par GAM et PAM ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en une diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et une augmentation \u00e9quivalente du patrimoine de Mme Panneton.\n[99] La Cour conclut donc que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[100] Ayant conclu que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la Cour de conclure quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, ce 26e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nJuge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 24\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2019-1067(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nDIANE PANNETON ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nle 6 d\u00e9cembre 2023\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL'honorable juge Dominique Lafleur\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nle 26 f\u00e9vrier 2024\nCOMPARUTIONS:\nAvocat de l'appelante :\nMe Simon St-Gelais\nAvocat de l'intim\u00e9 :\nMe Renaud Fioramore-Beaulieu\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER:\nPour l'appelante:\nNom :\nMe Simon St-Gelais\nCabinet :\nQuessy Henry St-Hilaire\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

INTRODUCTION\n[1] Wilfredo Castro, l\u2019appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, interjette appel d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab le ministre \u00bb) au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le 30 novembre 2018, en vertu de la partie IX de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, L.R.C. 1985, ch. E-15 (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab LTA \u00bb), pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er janvier 2018 au 31 mars 2018 (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00bb).\n[2] Dans le calcul de sa taxe nette, l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un rajustement pour une cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable relativement \u00e0 la cession d\u2019un immeuble.\n[3] Le ministre a refus\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 la demande de rajustement aux motifs que l\u2019appelant avait un lien de d\u00e9pendance avec l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de l\u2019immeuble et que la taxe exigible \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e et n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e, et ce, contrairement aux exigences de l\u2019article 231 et du paragraphe 231(1.1) de la LTA.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n[5] Les questions en litige sont les suivantes:\nEst-ce \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre a refus\u00e9 le rajustement au motif que l\u2019appelant avait un lien de d\u00e9pendance avec l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de l\u2019immeuble, soit la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 9221-2240 Qu\u00e9bec Inc.(ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb)?\nEst-ce \u00e0 bon droit que le ministre a refus\u00e9 le rajustement aux motifs que la taxe exigible pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette et n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e?\nIII.

LES FAITS PERTINENTS\nA. Mise en contexte\n[7] L\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse, Andr\u00e9a Castro (ci-apr\u00e8s, \u00ab les Castro \u00bb), sont des inscrits en vertu de la partie IX de la LTA.\n[8] Le 27 avril 2010, ils acqui\u00e8rent de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Concordia un immeuble situ\u00e9 au 1463, rue Bishop, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab l\u2019immeuble \u00bb) pour la somme de 3 250 000,00 $. L\u2019immeuble est utilis\u00e9 comme centre administratif, mais les Castro d\u00e9sirent entreprendre des r\u00e9novations majeures afin d\u2019y am\u00e9nager trente-deux (32) unit\u00e9s de logement locatif.\n[9] \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, les Castro sont administrateurs et d\u00e9tiennent chacun cinquante pour cent (50%) des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, constitu\u00e9e le 12 avril 2010. Celle-ci n\u2019a pas d\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale et n\u2019est pas inscrite en vertu de la LTA.\n[10] Ayant d\u00e9but\u00e9 le projet de r\u00e9novation de l\u2019immeuble, les Castro ont besoin de financement additionnel afin de pouvoir poursuivre les travaux et c\u2019est dans ce contexte qu\u2019ils acceptent une lettre d\u2019offre de financement dat\u00e9e du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2011 (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab lettre d\u2019offre \u00bb) de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Capital Corporation (\u00ab Capital \u00bb), un pr\u00eateur priv\u00e9, pour un pr\u00eat de 3 400 000,00 $.\n[11] Selon les dispositions de la lettre d\u2019offre, le pr\u00eat doit \u00eatre garanti par une hypoth\u00e8que de premier rang sur l\u2019immeuble, par un certain nombre d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques collat\u00e9rales et par un cautionnement personnel de l\u2019appelant et de son \u00e9pouse de 1 000 000 $ chacun. Il est pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019immeuble doit \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que les actions avec droit de vote de celle-ci, alors d\u00e9tenues par les Castro, doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une mise en gage au profit de Capital.\n[12] La lettre d\u2019offre pr\u00e9voit que la prise de garantie, la cession de l\u2019immeuble et le d\u00e9boursement des fonds doivent \u00eatre faits devant le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Capital et que les travaux doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9galement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Capital ou ses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s affili\u00e9es.\n[13] Par acte de cession notari\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012, les Castro c\u00e8dent l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la somme de 1,00 $ (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab cession \u00bb).\n[14] En vertu du contrat de cession pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9, l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse d\u00e9clarent que l\u2019immeuble est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 titre r\u00e9sidentiel, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures, qu\u2019aucun cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 son acquisition, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la vente est exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de taxes. \u00c0 cette m\u00eame date, les documents de garantie sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, dont l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que mobili\u00e8re avec d\u00e9possession des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de Capital.\n[15] Cependant, le projet de r\u00e9novation conna\u00eet maintes difficult\u00e9s. Capital entame une proc\u00e9dure pour la vente en justice de l\u2019immeuble tandis que les Castro entament une poursuite en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il y a \u00e9ventuellement un r\u00e8glement et le tout se solde par une entente sign\u00e9e le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013 selon laquelle les Castro c\u00e8dent leurs actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par Capital et ses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s affili\u00e9es, pour la somme de 1,00 $. En \u00e9change, ils sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9s des garanties donn\u00e9es en vertu de la lettre d\u2019offre, dont les cautionnements personnels de 1 000,000 $. Quelque temps plus tard, ils signent une quittance en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, laquelle est homologu\u00e9e par la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec le 5 mai 2016.\nB. La cotisation pour la taxe non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e\n[16] Entre-temps, le ministre entame une v\u00e9rification et conclut que la cession \u00e9tait une fourniture taxable puisque l\u2019immeuble ne servait pas \u00e0 des fins r\u00e9sidentielles et les r\u00e9novations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment avanc\u00e9es pour permettre une telle utilisation. Le ministre conclut donc que les Castro, \u00e0 titre d\u2019inscrits, devaient percevoir la taxe calcul\u00e9e sur la juste valeur marchande de l\u2019immeuble au moment de la cession, et ce en vertu du paragraphe 221(1) de la LTA.\n[17] Une cotisation est \u00e9tablie le 10 novembre 2016 pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la taxe que les Castro \u00e9taient tenus de d\u00e9clarer dans leur d\u00e9claration trimestrielle, soit une taxe de 85 050,00 $ chacun, excluant le montant de la taxe provinciale (TVQ). Cette cotisation est port\u00e9e en appel devant la pr\u00e9sente Cour dans le dossier 2017-4748(GST)G. Cependant, un avis de d\u00e9sistement est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 2 mars 2020, mettant ainsi fin au litige. Il en est de m\u00eame de la cotisation pour la TVQ.\nC. Les d\u00e9marches pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la taxe non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e\n[18] Ayant re\u00e7u la cotisation du 10 novembre 2016, les Castro entreprennent des d\u00e9marches, \u00e0 titre de mandataires du ministre, pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la TPS-TVQ relativement \u00e0 la cession de l\u2019immeuble le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012.\n[19] Cependant, ces d\u00e9marches sont infructueuses. Les procureurs de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soutiennent que la demande de remboursement est frivole puisque \u00ab le contrat notari\u00e9 \u00e9tait un acte authentique faisant preuve que (\u2026) le transfert de l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est une fourniture exon\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb. Les Castro re\u00e7oivent une derni\u00e8re lettre le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2018, rejetant leur demande et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019ils arrivent \u00e0 la conclusion que la cr\u00e9ance est irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[20] Dans sa d\u00e9claration de TPS pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant d\u00e9duit de sa taxe nette la somme de 81 250,00 $, soit le montant de la cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[21] En \u00e9tablissant la cotisation du 30 novembre 2018 dont il est ici question, le ministre a refus\u00e9 de donner droit \u00e0 la demande de rajustement pour ladite cr\u00e9ance.\nD. La perte en capital d\u00e9coulant de la vente des actions\n[22] Ayant conclu qu\u2019ils avaient subi une perte en capital \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la juste de valeur marchande des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en raison de la transaction du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013 et de la quittance du 19 avril, 2016, l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse entreprennent des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence de revenu du Qu\u00e9bec pour qu\u2019elle reconnaisse la perte en capital relativement \u00e0 la cession des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Au mois de mars 2018, Revenu Qu\u00e9bec reconna\u00eet que l\u2019appelant et sa conjointe ont subi une perte en capital de 1 780 777 $.\nV. ANALYSE\n[23] Avant qu\u2019un contribuable puisse demander une d\u00e9duction pour une cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable en vertu de l\u2019article 231 de la LTA, certaines conditions doivent \u00eatre remplies. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les conditions suivantes, telles que pr\u00e9vues aux paragraphes 231(1) et 231(1.1) de la LTA, font l\u2019objet d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend entre les parties:\nLes deux parties \u00e0 la transaction n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance;\nTout ou une partie de la contrepartie et de la taxe est devenu irr\u00e9couvrable;\nLa taxe percevable relativement \u00e0 la fourniture est incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette dans la d\u00e9claration qui est produite pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration au cours de laquelle la taxe est devenue percevable;\nLa totalit\u00e9 de la taxe nette \u00e0 verser selon cette d\u00e9claration est vers\u00e9e.\n[24] Ces conditions sont toutes obligatoires et cumulatives, de sorte que le non-respect de l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles constitue un obstacle \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction en question : Equinox Realty Ltd. c.

Le lien de d\u00e9pendance\n[25] Selon l\u2019appelant, la cession de l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait une condition essentielle de la lettre d\u2019offre de financement donnant lieu \u00e0 un contrat de pr\u00eat.\n[26] Puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s d\u2019effectuer la cession et \u00ab de consentir une hypoth\u00e8que mobili\u00e8re avec d\u00e9possession sur les actions \u00bb, les Castro soutiennent qu\u2019ils ont perdu le contr\u00f4le de droit et de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s \u00ab de leurs v\u00e9ritables pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels et donc de leur contr\u00f4le effectif au sein m\u00eame de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00bb\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie que les Castro aient perdu le contr\u00f4le de droit ou le contr\u00f4le de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient actionnaires majoritaires au moment de la cession et la convention de pr\u00eat pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019ils conservaient leur droit de vote et leur droit aux dividendes. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00ab il subsistait un lien de d\u00e9pendance entre l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur et le fournisseur lors de la vente du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012 \u00bb au sens des paragraphes 126(1) et 126(2) de la LTA et l\u2019appelant \u00ab n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 repousser la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 251(1) de la Loi sur les imp\u00f4ts \u00e0 l\u2019effet que des personnes li\u00e9es sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es avoir entre elles un lien de d\u00e9pendance. \u00bb\n[28] Pour d\u00e9terminer si des personnes sont li\u00e9es, le paragraphe 126(1) de la LTA pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab les personnes li\u00e9es sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es avoir entre elles un lien de d\u00e9pendance \u00bb. Le paragraphe 126(2) pr\u00e9voit ensuite que les paragraphes 251(2) \u00e0 (6) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (L.R.C. (1985), ch. E-15) (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb) s\u2019appliquent pour \u00ab d\u00e9terminer si des personnes sont li\u00e9es pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente. \u00bb\n[29] Le sous-alin\u00e9a 251(2)b) de la LIR pr\u00e9voit notamment que \u00ab sont des personnes li\u00e9es ou des personnes li\u00e9es entre elles \u00bb (\u2026) \u00ab une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab i) une personne qui contr\u00f4le la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 si cette derni\u00e8re est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par une personne \u00bb ou \u00ab ii) une personne qui est membre d\u2019un groupe li\u00e9 qui contr\u00f4le la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb ou encore \u00ab iii) toute personne li\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne vis\u00e9e au sous-alin\u00e9a i) ou ii. \u00bb\n[30] Le paragraphe 251(4) de la LIR d\u00e9finit l\u2019expression \u201cgroupe li\u00e9\u201d comme un \u201cgroupe de personnes dont chaque membre est li\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque autre membre du groupe\u201d. Comme l\u2019appelant et sa conjointe sont mari\u00e9s, ils sont des personnes li\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 251(2)a) de la LIR. Ils constituent donc un groupe li\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 251(4) de la LIR.\n[31] Selon la jurisprudence, si la Cour devait conclure que des personnes sont li\u00e9es, cette disposition cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption \u00ab irr\u00e9futable \u00bb ou m\u00eame \u00ab irr\u00e9fragable \u00bb qu\u2019ils ont un lien de d\u00e9pendance : Simard c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national \u2013 M.R.N.) [1994] A.C.I. no 1202 (par. 6) (d\u00e9cision \u00ab Simard \u00bb) et Lash c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national \u2013 M.R.N.) [2004] A.C.I. no 2004 (par. 9) (d\u00e9cision \u00ab Lash \u00bb).\n[32] Ainsi, si l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse contr\u00f4laient la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ensemble ou individuellement, ils \u00e9taient tous deux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au sens de la loi.\n[33] La notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 revue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Besse Syndics inc. c. Canada, 2021 CAF 115, o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[22] Les crit\u00e8res de contr\u00f4le de droit et de contr\u00f4le de fait visent tous deux \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelle personne exerce un contr\u00f4le sur la composition du conseil d'administration d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et donc sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame (Buckerfield\u2019s Limited c. Minister of National Revenue, 1964 CanLII 1187 (CA EXC), 64 DTC 5301 [Buckerfield\u2019s Limited]; Silicon Graphics au par. 67). [...]\n[23] La diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux crit\u00e8res se limite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des facteurs pouvant \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration afin de d\u00e9terminer qui contr\u00f4le une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e (McGillivray aux par. 47 et 48). Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le contr\u00f4le de droit r\u00e9side entre les mains de ceux ou celles qui ont le pouvoir de nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce sont les actionnaires majoritaires. Cependant, certains documents peuvent modifier ou restreindre leur pouvoir. L\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le de droit porte ainsi sur toute restriction interne \u2013 dans les actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou dans une convention unanime des actionnaires \u2013 au pouvoir de ces actionnaires d\u2019\u00e9lire les membres du conseil d\u2019administration ou de limiter la capacit\u00e9 du conseil d\u2019administration de g\u00e9rer les affaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. c. Canada, 1998 CanLII 827 (CSC), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 795 [Duha Printers] aux par. 36 et 37 (\u2026)\n(Non surlign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[34] Cette d\u00e9cision confirme que le contr\u00f4le de droit r\u00e9side entre les mains des personnes qui peuvent nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse. \u00c0 mon avis, le contrat de pr\u00eat et la mise en gage des actions ne peuvent constituer des documents pouvant modifier ou restreindre leur pouvoir de nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration.\n[35] Tel que l\u2019enseignent les professeurs Aurore Benadiba et Jacques Deslauriers dans \u00ab Titre II \u2013 Les hypoth\u00e8ques conventionnelles \u00bb, Les s\u00fbret\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec, 2e \u00e9d., Montr\u00e9al (QC), Wilson Lafleur, 2018, 295, \u00e0 la page 399 :\n1120. Le d\u00e9biteur conserve le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le bien gag\u00e9 (art. 2733 C.c.Q.). Par exemple, m\u00eame en les hypoth\u00e9quant avec d\u00e9possession, un actionnaire conserve la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses actions. Les restrictions auxquelles est assujetti le transfert de certaines actions ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00e0 leur mise en gage, le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019en \u00e9tant pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9. De l\u00e0 le maintien du droit de vote du d\u00e9biteur qui aurait donn\u00e9 des actions en gage \u00e0 moins que la dette ne soit pour le prix d\u2019acquisition de ces actions et que le contrat de vente ne contienne une clause \u00e0 cet effet.\n(Non surlign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[36] Le contr\u00f4le de fait n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 cette analyse et donc il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de savoir si Capital avait \u00ab une influence directe ou indirecte dont l\u2019exercice entra\u00eenerait le contr\u00f4le de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb, selon les termes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 256(5.11) de la LIR.\n[37] En d\u00e9pit du contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par Capital, comme relat\u00e9 par les Castro lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, la Cour doit conclure que ces derniers constituaient un groupe li\u00e9 puisqu\u2019ils poss\u00e9daient 100% des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils \u00e9taient ainsi tous deux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 251(2)b)(ii) de la LIR.\n[38] Ils sont donc r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir un lien de d\u00e9pendance avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 126 de la LTA et cette conclusion suffit, \u00e0 elle seule, pour disposer de l\u2019appel. Je vais n\u00e9anmoins revoir les conditions restantes.\nB. La cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable\n[39] L\u2019appelant maintient que la taxe nette qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb percevoir au moment de la cession et qu\u2019il a reconnue par l\u2019avis de d\u00e9sistement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le dossier d\u2019appel 2017-4748(GST)G est devenue irr\u00e9couvrable et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en droit de la radier de ses livres comptables pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e.\n[40] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019admet pas que la dette \u00e9tait irr\u00e9couvrable, la Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 \u00e9puiser toutes les voies de recours contre Capital pour conclure que la cr\u00e9ance \u00e9tait bel et bien irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[41] D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que les Castro avaient droit \u00e0 une perte en capital en raison de la cession de leurs actions pour une contrepartie de 1,00 $. La Cour est d\u2019avis que cela suffit pour conclure que la cr\u00e9ance en question \u00e9tait irr\u00e9couvrable au sens de l\u2019article 231 de la LTA.\nC. Les conditions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 231(1.1)\n[42] Les deux autres conditions sont pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 231(1.1) de la LTA, soit que la taxe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e et que la taxe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e.\n[43] Comme l\u2019indiqu\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions Equinox et 9267-9075 susmentionn\u00e9es, il s\u2019agit de conditions essentielles. Puisqu\u2019il la taxe nette exigible n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[44] Le paragraphe 231(1) de la LTA vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir une situation o\u00f9 il y a une fourniture taxable et, selon la disposition, \u00ab tout ou une partie de la contrepartie et de la taxe payable \u00bb n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9 par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de la fourniture.\n[45] Si la cr\u00e9ance est jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable et radi\u00e9e de ses livres comptables, l\u2019inscrit peut demander une d\u00e9duction dans le calcul de sa taxe nette. Autrement dit, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019inscrit n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9, en tout ou en partie, et que la cr\u00e9ance est radi\u00e9e de ses livres comptables, il peut r\u00e9clamer un rajustement.\n[46] Cependant, le paragraphe 231(1.1) impose comme conditions que \u00ab la taxe percevable relativement \u00e0 la fourniture (\u2026) pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration au cours de laquelle la taxe est devenue percevable \u00bb soit incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette et que \u00ab la totalit\u00e9 de la taxe nette \u00bb soit vers\u00e9e. En fin de compte, ces dispositions permettent \u00e0 l\u2019inscrit de r\u00e9clamer un remboursement de la taxe nette qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et vers\u00e9e, mais qui est devenue irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[47] Dans cette instance, les Castro ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mal avis\u00e9s quant \u00e0 leur obligation de percevoir la taxe lors de la cession du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012. Ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la taxe nette et celle-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est que plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus tard, lorsque la cotisation pour la taxe percevable est devenue d\u00e9finitive, qu\u2019ils ont tent\u00e9 de recouvrer la cr\u00e9ance aupr\u00e8s de Capital, l\u2019actionnaire subs\u00e9quent de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[48] Je ne crois pas que le l\u00e9gislateur, en cr\u00e9ant la d\u00e9duction \u00e0 l\u2019article 231 de la LTA, souhaitait la rendre disponible aux inscrits qui se retrouvent dans la situation des Castro. Ajoutons \u00e0 cela que l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la d\u00e9duction aux situations semblables \u00e0 celle-ci pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences importantes. Il serait trop facile de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de payer la taxe s\u2019il suffisait de ne pas l\u2019inclure dans sa d\u00e9claration et ensuite d\u2019attendre plusieurs ann\u00e9es que les autorit\u00e9s fiscales \u00e9tablissent une cotisation, uniquement pour r\u00e9clamer une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 parce que le passage des ann\u00e9es a rendu la cr\u00e9ance irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[49] La situation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e par les Castro est certainement malencontreuse et il est manifeste qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 manipul\u00e9s par leur partenaire d\u2019affaires et mal avis\u00e9s par le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le pr\u00eateur. Malheureusement, l\u2019erreur de droit, quelle que soit sa source, ne peut constituer une justification valable pour donner droit \u00e0 la demande de rajustement en vertu du paragraphe 231(1) de la LTA.\n[50] Pour ces motifs, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 17e jour de janvier 2024.\n\u00ab Guy Smith \u00bb\nJuge Smith\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE:\n2024 CCI 3\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR:\n2021-1049(GST)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE:\nWILFREDO CASTRO ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE:\nLe 22 mars 2023\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR:\nL'honorable juge Guy R.

L\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 ultimement rejet\u00e9 par le juge du fond le 16 octobre 2018 (Jugement) sur pr\u00e9sentation, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel le 15 octobre 2018, d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour cause de retard en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t (Proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale), DORS\/90-688, telles que modifi\u00e9es (R\u00e8gles).\n[2] L\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles se lit comme suit :\n64 L\u2019intim\u00e9e qui n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9faut en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou d\u2019un jugement de la Cour peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate, le rejet de l\u2019appel pour cause de retard si l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas poursuivi l\u2019appel avec promptitude.\n[3] Ainsi, les motifs au soutien du rejet de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es sont en lien avec les circonstances et les d\u00e9lais avec lesquels la requ\u00e9rante a men\u00e9 son appel devant la Cour. Les motifs de la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de son appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en avril 2011 ne sont pas au c\u0153ur du Jugement rendu dont la requ\u00e9rante cherche l\u2019annulation.\n[4] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019audition tenue le 15 octobre 2018 fait \u00e9tat du d\u00e9bat qu\u2019a entrain\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour rejet d\u2019appel pour cause de retard. Et suite \u00e0 ce d\u00e9bat, le Jugement fut rendu en accordant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et rejetant l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante visant les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. Le Jugement n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel par aucune des parties au Jugement.\n[5] L\u2019historique du pr\u00e9sent dossier de la Cour indique que pendant une dur\u00e9e de plus de sept ans, 4 avocats se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 pour repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la requ\u00e9rante, les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers amend\u00e9s, la liste de documents de la requ\u00e9rante d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 3 mars 2016, des audiences de justification tenues, un juge gestionnaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9, une date d\u2019audition d\u00e9termin\u00e9e le 14 novembre 2017 pour audition les 15, 16 et 17 octobre 2018. Et ultimement, le premier jour de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel une requ\u00eate pour cessation d\u2019occuper de l\u2019avocat de la requ\u00e9rante est trait\u00e9e et aucun procureur pour repr\u00e9senter les appelantes (dont la requ\u00e9rante), seul un repr\u00e9sentant agissant pour le compte des fiducies au dossier (dont la requ\u00e9rante) pr\u00e9sent pour l\u2019unique fin de d\u00e9poser un document qui demande l\u2019ajournement de tous les dossiers des appelantes (incluant la requ\u00e9rante) devant la Cour.\n[6] La requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 5 juillet 2023 une requ\u00eate en vertu de l\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles (Requ\u00eate) afin d\u2019annuler le Jugement rejetant l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, et r\u00e9f\u00e8re plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) des R\u00e8gles. La requ\u00e9rante demande que la Requ\u00eate soit tranch\u00e9e sur la base des observations \u00e9crites et sans comparution des parties conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 69 des R\u00e8gles.\n[7] La Requ\u00eate indique notamment que :\nLa requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 obtenir la r\u00e9ouverture du dossier 2011-1193(IT)G \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9ception du dossier : Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019Information. Je suis en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas analys\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des informations Les procureurs de la Cour Canadienne d\u2019Imp\u00f4t (sic) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 induits en erreur \u00e0 la suite de documents non-divulgu\u00e9 par des repr\u00e9sentants(es)de l\u2019ARC et de la Division des enqu\u00eates.\nLes documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s d\u00e9montrent clairement un impact n\u00e9gatif majeur sur les jugements rendus. Les procureurs qui le repr\u00e9sentaient ont \u00e9t\u00e9, par ce fait, induits en erreur.\nSelon la r\u00e8gle 172(2)a, le requ\u00e9rant demande l\u2019annulation pour les modifications d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu.\n[8] L\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit :\n172 (1) Le jugement qui :\na) comporte une erreur d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un lapsus ou d\u2019une omission;\nb) doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 une question sur laquelle la Cour n\u2019a pas statu\u00e9, peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 par la Cour, sur demande ou de son propre chef.\n(2) Une partie peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate dans l\u2019instance, selon le cas :\na) l\u2019annulation ou la modification d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu;\nb) un sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement;\nc) une mesure de redressement diff\u00e9rente de celle qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[9] La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9cise que les moyens au soutien de la Requ\u00eate sont les suivants :\nPar suite de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, le requ\u00e9rant est en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ARC et la Division des enqu\u00eates avaient la preuve depuis 2006 que Fiducie Mario Laquerre n\u2019avait pas omis de d\u00e9clarer un montant de 261 734,69$ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2001.\nFiducie Mario Laquerre avait contract\u00e9 un pr\u00eat \u00e0 Fiducie ML et ce dit pr\u00eat, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de moins de 12 mois \u00e0 Fiducie ML. Le requ\u00e9rant a re\u00e7u un tableau des enqu\u00eates d\u00e9montrant un encaissement des ch\u00e8ques totalisant 167 000$ du compte de Fiducie ML Banque de Montr\u00e9al. Cet encaissement provenait de Fiducie Mario Laquerre au compte 3391 pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er novembre au 24 d\u00e9cembre 2001.\nLe requ\u00e9rant a re\u00e7u le dossier jaune de Jeannot Roy d\u00e9montrant un remboursement additionnel de 250K de Fiducie Mario Laquerre \u00e0 Fiducie ML de janvier 2002 \u00e0 novembre 2002.\n[10] Il y a lieu de pr\u00e9ciser que la Cour ne peut \u00eatre saisie que de la Requ\u00eate visant l\u2019annulation du Jugement rendu. Et dans ce contexte, le r\u00f4le de la Cour n\u2019est pas de statuer sur le fond ou le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es.\n[11] La Cour constate \u00e9galement que les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante sont uniquement en lien avec l\u2019objet ou le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. Aucun des moyens invoqu\u00e9s ne vise le fait que le Jugement suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement, tel que le requiert l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) des R\u00e8gles.\n[12] L\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles d\u00e9cide uniquement d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour rejet de l\u2019appel en lien avec le d\u00e9faut de promptitude dont a pu faire preuve l\u2019appelant \u00e0 poursuivre son appel. La situation ainsi examin\u00e9e est post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019appel par l\u2019appelant devant la Cour. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, cette p\u00e9riode est post\u00e9rieure au 18 avril 2011 et ne vise que les agissements de la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 faire preuve de promptitude dans la poursuite de son appel devant la Cour.\n[13] Le Jugement repr\u00e9sente la d\u00e9cision de la Cour quant \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la promptitude dont a fait preuve la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 poursuivre son appel. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue sur le bien-fond\u00e9 ou le fond de l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante. Un d\u00e9saccord de la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aurait justifi\u00e9 un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 27 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[14] Alternativement, une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles, notamment l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) comme l\u2019a fait la requ\u00e9rante. Cependant, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Doussot c. Canada, 2022 CAF 199 souligne que pour r\u00e9ussir sous l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) :\nun requ\u00e9rant doit prouver que l\u2019annulation ou la modification du jugement en cause est justifi\u00e9e en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que ledit jugement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Cela requiert une preuve, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCI.\n[15] Les trois moyens soulev\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante visent le fond de l\u2019appel \u00e0 savoir selon la requ\u00e9rante que l\u2019appel serait bien fond\u00e9. Tel que repris au paragraphe 8 plus haut, les moyens invoquent le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019omission de d\u00e9clarer un montant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2001, qu\u2019un pr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de moins de 12 mois, et qu\u2019un remboursement additionnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 de janvier 2002 \u00e0 novembre 2002. Aucun de ces moyens n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli comme ayant un lien avec la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles.\n[16] La Cour n\u2019est pas persuad\u00e9e, selon la balance de probabilit\u00e9s, que les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de la Requ\u00eate \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019il y a eu fraude de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec le Jugement rendu ou que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et qui s\u2019av\u00e9raient importants aux fins du Jugement rendu en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles ou encore auraient probablement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un jugement diff\u00e9rent toujours sous l\u2019article 64 s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s initialement.\n[17] La requ\u00e9rante ne pr\u00e9cise pas la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a re\u00e7u les documents suite \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Elle r\u00e9f\u00e8re la Cour \u00e0 un document \u00e9manant du Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019information du Canada en date du 30 mai 2022.\n[18] Les pi\u00e8ces au soutien de la Requ\u00eate contiennent essentiellement une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux (i) documents li\u00e9s au dossier de la Cour concernant l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (ii) documents judiciaires impliquant nomm\u00e9ment la requ\u00e9rante, monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement ou l\u2019une ou des parties li\u00e9es regroup\u00e9es avec la requ\u00e9rante aux fins de la tenue de l\u2019audition (collectivement Personnes nomm\u00e9es), (iii) documents et bordereaux bancaires des Personnes nomm\u00e9es en lien avec les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (iv) document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec la v\u00e9rification et les documents bancaires des Personnes nomm\u00e9es aux Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (v) document judiciaire provenant d\u2019un dossier judiciaire impliquant monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement et des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des op\u00e9rations bancaires en 2001, (vi) communication interne de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec la section du recouvrement, et (vii) courriel auquel est partie monsieur Mario Laquerre.\n[19] La r\u00e9plique de la requ\u00e9rante aux observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la Requ\u00eate et d\u2019autres documents dont (i) des analyses bancaires en lien avec les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (ii) pi\u00e8ces sur lesquels la requ\u00e9rante tire des conclusions l\u00e9gales concernant la v\u00e9rification fiscale de la requ\u00e9rante, et (iii) document judiciaire dat\u00e9 de 2006 impliquant monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement.\n[20] Malheureusement, l\u2019examen de toutes ces pi\u00e8ces n\u2019am\u00e8ne pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments substantiels ou suffisamment pertinents au soutien de la fa\u00e7on dont la requ\u00e9rante a pu poursuivre avec promptitude ou diligence l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es devant la Cour. Cet examen n\u2019est pas davantage concluant pour la Cour aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu fraude dans le cadre de l\u2019audition ayant men\u00e9 au Jugement, ni que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et pr\u00e9sentent une importance telle qu\u2019ils entachent la validit\u00e9 du Jugement.\n[21] En fait, la Cour est d\u2019avis que les moyens de la requ\u00e9rante accompagn\u00e9s des pi\u00e8ces sont essentiellement des motifs que la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu vouloir d\u00e9battre au fond. Ce d\u00e9bat n\u2019a pu eu lieu consid\u00e9rant le Jugement et le r\u00f4le de la Cour n\u2019est pas d\u2019ouvrir ce d\u00e9bat en tranchant la Requ\u00eate.\n[22] Consid\u00e9rant ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour est d\u2019avis que la preuve de la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de la Requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, fraude de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec le Jugement rendu ou que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et qui s\u2019av\u00e9raient importants aux fins du Jugement rendu en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles, ou auraient pu donner lieu \u00e0 un jugement diff\u00e9rent, toujours sous l\u2019article 64, s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s initialement.\n[23] La Requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens de 1 000 $ payables par la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans les 30 jours suivants la date des pr\u00e9sentes.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 19e jour de janvier 2024.\n\u00ab J.M.
