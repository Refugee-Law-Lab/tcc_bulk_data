Background [1] At the hearing of the applicants\u2019 appeals on the merits, they objected to having the documents mentioned in Appendix 1 to these reasons filed as evidence. The Court took under advisement the applicants\u2019 objections, having been informed by the applicants that, after the hearing of the appeals, they would file an application to have these documents excluded.\n[2] The documents at issue come from a search performed on January 25, 2012, under section 487 of the Criminal Code, at the premises of SPE, SPE Affacturage Inc. and SPEQ SPE Technologies, located in Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, and the residence of Mr. Plante and his wife Julie Grenier, also located in Saint-Georges-de-Beauce. The Court and the parties qualified the objections as \u00abumbrella objections.\u00bb\n[3] The applicants argue that the documents at issue must be excluded from the evidence pursuant to subsection 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\u00abCharter\u00bb). They submit that the Minister of National Revenue (the \u00abMinister\u00bb) cannot use documents obtained pursuant to a search warrant to reassess the applicants. According to the applicants, admission of these documents into evidence would contravene sections 7 and 8 of the Charter.\n[4] The respondent argues that the documents must be included in the evidence. These documents were obtained under a valid search warrant pursuant to section 487 of the Criminal Code. The applicants did not challenge the search warrant.\n[5] The respondent therefore argues that the Minister could rely on these documents to reassess the applicants. According to the respondent, filing these documents as evidence in the applicants\u2019 appeals does not contravene sections 7 and 8 of the Charter. Consequently, the documents are admissible in evidence to determine whether the reassessments that the Minister made against the applicants are correct in fact and in law.\nII. Facts [6] In February 2006, the Canada Revenue Agency (\u00abCRA\u00bb) undertook a tax audit of certain individuals who had acquired licences from SPE.\n[7] This tax audit was subsequently extended to Mr. Plante and SPE.\n[8] Ms. Drew, an auditor at the CRA\u2019s Eastern Quebec Tax Services Office, began her audit of the applicants\u2019 files in early 2007. On April 29, 2009, Ms. Drew sent Mr. Plante and SPE a letter advising them that the audit of the tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 period was completed. Her letter also asked the applicants to send her comments on the proposed adjustments. At that time, Ms. Drew had not received the statements that the CRA\u2019s Tax Avoidance Division had requested from the relevant U.S. authorities.\n[9] Ms. Morin replaced Ms. Drew as the auditor. After she had reviewed the files and received the documents from the relevant U.S. authorities in June and August 2009, Ms. Morin prepared a T134 \u2013 Referral to Investigations form in November 2009, i.e. she transferred the SPE file and Mr. Plante\u2019s file to the Criminal Investigations Division for review.\n[10] In December 2009, the applicants\u2019 files were assigned to Mr. Potvin, an investigator with the Enforcement Division (criminal investigations) at the CRA\u2019s Eastern Quebec Tax Services Office (\u201cCriminal Investigations Division\u201d).\n[11] After the files had been reviewed, the CRA had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Plante, SPE and other companies had, together or separately, made false or misleading statements for the purpose of evading or attempting to evade the tax payable or allow others to avoid paying their taxes. In this regard, Mr. Potvin prepared information to obtain search warrants under section 487 of the Criminal Code.\n[12] On January 12, 2012, search warrants were obtained for Mr. Plante and SPE. The warrants authorized CRA investigators to search the premises of SPE, SPE Affacturage Inc., and SPEQ SPE Technologies, and the personal residence of Mr. Plante and his spouse Julie Grenier.\n[13] The warrants were executed on January 25, 2012. The applicants never challenged the validity of the search warrants.\n[14] On March 14, 2012, Mr. Longchamps of the Criminal Investigations Division wrote to SPE and to Mr. Plante and Ms. Grenier, informing them that a justice of the peace of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec had signed an order on March 13, 2012, to detain documents under section 490 of the Criminal Code, which authorized the CRA to detain the things seized until April 25, 2012. Also attached to the letters dated March 14, 2012, are the appendices of the report to a justice of the peace, which contain the inventory of the things seized when the search warrant was executed. Mr. Longchamps also advised the applicants that a full investigation was under way and that the seized things could be required in court as evidence that an offence had been committed within the meaning of section 239 of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d).\n[15] The CRA made two applications for further detention of the things seized, one in March and another in December 2012. The second application was dated December 4, 2012. On December 5, 2012, Mr. Plante consented to the further detention of the things seized by the CRA.\n[16] At the end of December 2012, the CRA closed the Criminal Investigations Division of the Eastern Quebec Tax Services Office. Mr. Potvin was transferred to the Audit Division of the Eastern Quebec Tax Services Office. As an auditor, Mr. Potvin became responsible for the civil aspect of the applicants\u2019 cases.\n[17] On January 21, 2013, Mr. Potvin sent Mr. Plante a letter advising him that the criminal investigation against him and SPE had been discontinued. An application for an order for the return of the things seized, pursuant to subsection 490(5) of the Criminal Code, was filed by the applicants on January 21, 2013, in the Court of Qu\u00e9bec to have the things seized returned to the applicants.\n[18] The decision to discontinue the criminal investigation was based on a cost\/benefit analysis by Mr. Potvin\u2019s team.\n[19] On October 1, 2013, Mr. Potvin advised SPE and Mr. Plante that the audit on the 2005 to 2009 tax returns was completed, reassessments would be made and a penalty would be imposed pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the ITA.\n[20] In October 2013, notices of reassessment were issued by the Minister against some of SPE valeur Assurable inc.\u2019s licensees, including Claude Lessard and Eric Gilbert, as well as Mr. Plant and SPE. When making the reassessments, the Minister relied on some of the documents obtained during the searches, which are the subject of this motion.\n[21] Mr. Potvin testified that when an investigator accepts a file from the audit department, he deals with both the criminal and civil aspects of the case. The investigator sees the case through to the end. According to Mr. Potvin, this is self-evident because the investigator must calculate the amount of tax evaded in case of an offence under section 239 of the ITA.\n[22] The evidence also demonstrated that during the criminal investigation, the CRA\u2019s auditors and investigators did not use the civil powers set out in sections 231.1 (Inspections) and 231.2 (Requirement to provide documents or information) of the ITA.\nIII. Issues [23] Are the documents covered by the \u00abumbrella objections\u00bb admissible as evidence in the appeals from the reassessments issued against the applicants? Does the filing of these documents as evidence contravene sections 7 and 8 of the Charter?\nIV. Positions of the parties and analysis [24] The applicants argue that the documents obtained during the search must be excluded from the evidence under subsection 24(2) of the Charter. They submit that the respondent cannot enter into evidence the documents obtained via the search because they had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to these documents. Filing these documents as evidence contravenes sections 7 and 8 of the Charter. The Minister could not rely on those documents to make reassessments. Accordingly, the respondent cannot file these documents as part of the applicants\u2019 reassessment appeals for the following reasons:\n(i)The CRA apparently used the criminal investigation to move forward with the audit.\n(ii)Documents seized during the criminal investigation could not be photocopied by the CRA and used for civilian purposes.\n(iii)Merger of powers between the audit and the criminal investigation.\n(iv)Documents obtained during a search conducted for the purpose of investigating criminal offences could not be used by the CRA for civil purposes, including making reassessments.\n(v)During the search, the CRA seized personal documents unrelated to the transactions at issue. The documents that were seized could not have been obtained during an audit because they were emails from third parties. In addition, the applicants had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to these documents. The applicants\u2019 privacy was therefore violated, in contravention of section 8 of the Charter.\n(i) The CRA apparently used the criminal search warrant to move forward with the audit.\n[25] The applicants state that they are not challenging the search warrant. That being said, they argue that the search warrant was apparently obtained to move forward with the audit. This argument does not hold water. There is no evidence before the Court upon which I can find that the criminal investigation was a pretext for obtaining documents for the purposes of the audit. On the contrary, Mr. Potvin testified that after having reviewed the documents obtained during the audit, including the documents of the competent authorities, he had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Plant and SPE had contravened the ITA. However, valid search warrants were issued by a judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec under section 487 of the Criminal Code. The applicants never challenged the search warrant.[1]\n(ii) Documents seized during the criminal investigation could not be photocopied by the CRA and used for civilian purposes.\n[26] The applicants argue that the circumstances indicated that the documents were photocopied for use in the civil audit. The applicants rely on the following facts: the Eastern Quebec Office closed its Criminal Investigations Division at the end of December 2012. On that date, Mr. Potvin was transferred to the Audit Division as an auditor. According to the applicants, the facts show that the criminal investigation was completed in December 2012. According to the applicants, this proves that the CRA only requested further detention of the documents on December 4, 2012, to give the Agency enough time to photocopy the documents.\n[27] Although the Criminal Investigations Division closed at the end of December, the applicants were not informed until January 23, 2013, that the investigation had been discontinued. The applicants did not submit any evidence to support their contentions. They are based on assumptions and suspicions. This argument therefore has no merit.\n[28] At any rate, the documents at issue all come from the seizure of computer equipment. At the hearing of the appellants\u2019 appeals on the merits, the evidence showed that, as stipulated in the search warrant, Ms. Arbour, as a CRA computer forensics investigator, was required to compile an inventory of all the electronic devices seized and describe each document or item of evidence. Ms. Arbour was the custodian of the documents from the electronic devices. As an investigator, Mr. Potvin did not have access to the seized computer contents. He had to submit specific requests for documents to Ms. Arbour; for example, he could ask for documents relating to Mr. Mavrovic. Ms. Arbour ensured that the search warrant covered the requested documents before providing copies to Mr. Potvin. Therefore, with respect to the documents at issue, when Mr. Potvin required photocopies of the electronic documents, Ms. Arbour made them for him.\n[29] The applicants also argue that the CRA cannot retain a copy of seized documents once the criminal investigation is completed. According to the applicants, this would allow the CRA to gather evidence for possible civil proceedings, thereby ignoring the principles that underpin the search powers and the protections set out in section 490 of the Criminal Code.\n[30] The applicants have already argued this issue before the Federal Court of Canada[2]. Before the Federal Court, the applicants challenged the CRA\u2019s decision to send Revenu Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cRQ\u201d) a copy of the documents that were seized during the search of SPE\u2019s offices and the personal residence of Mr. Plante and Ms. Grenier. Before the Federal Court, they argued that once the criminal investigation was completed and the CRA decided not to lay charges, the CRA could not retain a copy of the documents, let alone send a copy of the documents to RQ. At paragraphs 26 and 31 of her reasons, Gagn\u00e9 J. rejected the applicants\u2019 argument, writing as follows:\n[26] First the Criminal Code provisions are clear: since the seizure was executed under a valid warrant, the CRA has an unequivocal right to make copies of the seized documents (P\u00e8se P\u00eache Inc v R, 2013 NBCA 37 at paras 12-13; Re Moyer (1994), 95 CCC (3d) 174 at paras 15, 26 (Ont Gen Div); Cartier, above at paras 20, 25; Bleet, above at para 8; Black, above at para 27; Bromley v Canada, 2002 BCSC 149 at para 26).\n[\u2026]\n[31] It follows that the CRA could retain a copy of the documents seized during the search of SPE\u2019s offices and that therefore it is retaining them legally.\n[My emphasis.]\n[31] I agree with Gagn\u00e9 J.\u2019s comments.[3]\n(iii) Merger of powers between the audit and the criminal investigation.\n[32] At the hearing of the appeals on the merits, Mr. Potvin testified that when investigators accept a case from the Criminal Investigations Division, they deal with both the civil and the criminal aspects of the case. Mr. Potvin reassessed the applicants. In this case, Mr. Potvin was an auditor when the reassessments were made in October 2013. However, Mr. Potvin testified that if he had still held the position of investigator in the Criminal Investigation Division, he would nevertheless have made the reassessments because the calculation of criminal fines under section 239 of the ITA is generally based on the tax evaded.\n[33] According to the applicants, this merger of roles is inconsistent with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in R. v. Jarvis[4], which required that a distinction be made between the CRA\u2019s audit and criminal investigative powers. Thus, the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant cannot be admitted into evidence for civil purposes.\n[34] I do not agree with the applicants\u2019 interpretation of Jarvis. That case did not decide that, in a criminal investigation, a CRA officer cannot use the civil powers set out in sections 231.1 and 231.2 of the ITA. Jarvis stands for the proposition that a criminal investigation and an audit may be conducted simultaneously. However, where the purpose of an inquiry or a question is the determination of a taxpayer\u2019s penal liability, the CRA must avail itself of a search warrant to obtain the documents needed for the investigation. Then, the protections guaranteed by the Charter apply. Thus, an investigator may not use civil powers such as the powers granted by subsections 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) of the ITA, including inspection and requirement powers, to advance a criminal investigation. This would run counter to the principle against self-incrimination. However, this does not mean that documents obtained pursuant to civil powers cannot be used for assessment purposes. In this regard, Iacobucci and Majors JJ. stated the following at paragraphs 97 and 98 of their reasons:\n97 The predominant purpose test does not thereby prevent the CCRA from conducting parallel criminal investigations and administrative audits. The fact that the CCRA is investigating a taxpayer\u2019s penal liability, does not preclude the possibility of a simultaneous investigation, the predominant purpose of which is a determination of the same taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. However, if an investigation into penal liability is subsequently commenced, the investigators can avail themselves of that information obtained pursuant to the audit powers prior to the commencement of the criminal investigation, but not with respect to information obtained pursuant to such powers subsequent to the commencement of the investigation into penal liability. This is no less true where the investigations into penal liability and tax liability are in respect of the same tax period. So long as the predominant purpose of the parallel investigation actually is the determination of tax liability, the auditors may continue to resort to ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1). It may well be that there will be circumstances in which the CCRA officials conducting the tax liability inquiry will desire to inform the taxpayer that a criminal investigation also is under way and that the taxpayer is not obliged to comply with the requirement powers of ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) for the purposes of the criminal investigation. On the other hand, the authorities may wish to avail themselves of the search warrant procedures under ss. 231.3 of the ITA or 487 of the Criminal Code to access the documents necessary to advance the criminal investigation. Put another way, the requirement powers of ss. 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) cannot be used to compel oral statements or written production for the purpose of advancing the criminal investigation.\n98 In summary, wherever the predominant purpose of an inquiry or question is the determination of penal liability, criminal investigatory techniques must be used. As a corollary, all Charter protections that are relevant in the criminal context must apply.\n[35] Furthermore, Bauer[5], rendered by the Federal Court of Appeal, involved a criminal investigation that was under way. The criminal investigator used the civil power set out in subsection 231.2(1) of the ITA, i.e. the power to issue requirements for information, to obtain two documents from Mr. Bauer. Mr. Bauer argued that the same person could not conduct the criminal investigation and exercise civil powers at the same time. Mr. Bauer submitted that the documents obtained pursuant to the requirements for information that had been used to make reassessments should be excluded from the evidence.\n[36] In Bauer, Webb J. of the Federal Court of Appeal said the CRA may continue to use its civil powers during a criminal investigation. According to Webb J., if these powers can be exercised by two different individuals at the CRA, there does not seem to be any reason why the powers cannot be exercised by the same person at CRA. What matters is how the CRA uses the documents that have been obtained. According to Bauer, documents obtained by the investigator pursuant to requirements for information could be used to assess Mr. Bauer, but could not be used to advance the criminal investigation. Webb J. specified that our Court should only concern itself with civil matters, not criminal matters, which come under the purview of provincial courts.\n[37] In Bauer, Webb J. also stated that there is a common element in reassessments and any charges under section 239 of the ITA: they both require the same calculation, that is to say, the determination of the tax payable, i.e. the tax debt.\n[38] The principles laid down by Webb J. in Bauer are found in paragraphs 12 to 14 of his reasons:\n[12] Mr. Bauer\u2019s argument is that his case can be distinguished from Romanuk on the basis that while the audit powers remain in effect following the commencement of an investigation, these powers cannot be exercised by the same person who is doing the investigation related to section 239 of the ITA. In my view this distinction is not material. If the powers can be exercised by two different individuals at CRA there does not seem to be any reason why the powers cannot be exercised by the same person at CRA. In each case the question will be whether the documents obtained are to be used for administrative purposes or for the purposes of a prosecution under section 239 of the ITA.\n[13] In my view, even though an investigation had commenced that could lead to charges being laid under section 239 of the ITA, this does not preclude the CRA from using requirements to obtain information or documents that could be used only in relation to the reassessments. Both the reassessments and any charges under section 239 of the ITA ultimately relate to the underlying tax liability of the taxpayer. Therefore, there is a common element in both matters the determination of the unreported income of the taxpayer for a particular year. Common facts will be needed for both the administrative reassessment and the penal charges under section 239 of the ITA.\n[14] While using requirements under section 231.2 of the ITA to obtain information or documents after an investigation has commenced may result in that information or those documents not being admissible in a proceeding related to the prosecution of offences under section 239 of the ITA, it does not preclude that information or documents from being admissible in a Tax Court of Canada proceeding where the issue is the validity of an assessment issued under the ITA. It is the use of the information or documents that is relevant, not who at CRA issued the requirement for information or documents.\n[My emphasis.]\n[39] The same situation occurred in Piersanti v. The Queen[6] where the person responsible for the criminal investigation at the CRA had used the civil power set out in subsection 231.2(1) of the ITA, the requirement power, to obtain documents from several third parties to advance the criminal investigation. Our Court decided that documents obtained through requirements for information during the criminal investigation could be used to make the reassessments. This decision was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal[7].\n[40] In the light of these decisions, the fact that Mr. Potvin was responsible for the criminal investigation and that he reassessed the applicants is irrelevant. What matters is that the CRA did not violate the principles set out in Jarvis. It is clear that, in the cases before this Court, the principles set out in Jarvis were followed. During the criminal investigation, the CRA did not use any of the civil powers set out in sections 231.1(1) and 231.2(1) of the ITA.\n[41] In any case, the evidence shows that when the reassessments were made in October 2013, Mr. Potvin had been acting as auditor in the applicants\u2019 case since the end of December 2012.\n(iv) The CRA could not use the documents obtained during a search for the purpose of making assessments. As a result, these documents could not be admissible in evidence; and\n(v) During the search, the CRA seized personal documents that were unrelated to the transactions at issue. In addition, the documents that the respondent seeks to enter into evidence are not records as provided for in section 231 of the ITA. The applicants\u2019 privacy was therefore violated, in contravention of section 8 of the Charter.\n[42] I will analyze arguments (iv) and (v) together. The applicants argue that sections 7 and 8 of the Charter were violated.\n[43] Sections 7 and 8 of the Charter provide as follows:\n7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\n8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\n[44] In Jarvis[8], Iacobucci and Majors JJ. stated that, for section 7 of the Charter to apply, the court must first determine whether there exists a real or imminent deprivation of life, liberty, security of the person or a combination thereof. In the case of a trial involving tax evasion offences under section 239 of the ITA, the taxpayer faces the threat of imprisonment on conviction. As a result, when information, which is obtained by requirements in the exercise of a power conferred by the ITA, is submitted during the trial, section 7 of the Charter is engaged. The relevant principle of fundamental justice in this case is the principle against self-incrimination.\n[45] However, this case does not involve criminal questions. It involve civil questions. The applicants are not facing the threat of imprisonment. The applicants are not at risk of any real or imminent deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person. Section 7 of the Charter is therefore not engaged.\n[46] With respect to section 8 of the Charter, Iacobucci and Majors JJ. stated the following in Jarvis[9]:\nFor the application of s. 8, there must first be a search or seizure. Subsequently, it must be determined whether the search or seizure was unreasonable. [\u2026] S. 8 protects a reasonable expectation of privacy. [\u2026] What is reasonable, however, is context-specific. In the application of s. 8, \u201can assessment must be made as to whether in a particular situation the public\u2019s interest in being left alone by government must give way to the government\u2019s interest in intruding on the individual\u2019s privacy in order to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement\u201d [\u2026]\n[47] The relevant cases here are Klundert v. Canada[10] and Brown v. Canada[11], rendered by the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[48] In Klundert, information obtained during a criminal tax evasion investigation was used to obtain a jeopardy order under section 225.2 of the ITA. In a unanimous decision, Dawson J. of the Federal Court of Appeal stated the following at paragraph 10 of her reasons:\n[\u2026] there is no reason why information obtained in a criminal investigation, such as information gathered pursuant to a lawful search warrant, should not be available for related civil purposes.\n[49] In Brown, the Minister had made reassessments that added undeclared income and assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA. Mr. Brown argued that the documents obtained during a search by the London Police Service, which the police then gave to the CRA, could not be used by the CRA to make civil assessments and, therefore, be filed as evidence.\n[50] In Brown, a unanimous decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, Dawson J. ruled that the seized documents could be given to the CRA and filed as evidence. According to Dawson J., Mr. Brown had not demonstrated that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the documents seized by the London Police. Mr. Dawson could not expect the London Police to maintain the confidentiality of the seized documents. In this regard, Dawson J. wrote the following at paragraphs 18 to 23 of her reasons:\n[18] Section 8 of the Charter guarantees everyone \u201cthe right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure\u201d. The Supreme Court of Canada has defined this right as one which protects a reasonable expectation of privacy (R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] S.C.J. No. 53).\n[19] The search and seizure conducted by the London Police Service was authorized by warrant. At no time has the appellant challenged the validity of the search warrant. It follows that the search and the seizure were lawful. The question then becomes whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation that the London Police Service would maintain the confidentiality of the documents it seized. The existence of any such expectation depends upon \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d (Cole, at paragraph 39).\n[20] The appellant did not point to any evidence or judicial authority which supports the conclusion that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the documents lawfully seized by the London Police Service.\n[21] As to the evidence, the appellant\u2019s evidence before the Tax Court was inconsistent with any subjective expectation of privacy. In direct examination he stated that the documents seized by the police should have been returned to him, so that the Canada Revenue Agency could then ask him to deliver the documents to it (transcript of evidence given on February 28, 2012, at page 173).\n[\u2026]\n[23] Because the appellant failed to demonstrate that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the seized documents, it follows that the appellant\u2019s right to be free of any unreasonable search or seizure was not violated. It further follows that the Judge was correct to receive the documents into evidence.\n[51] These two Federal Court of Appeal cases stand for the proposition that the CRA may use the documents it seized in a criminal search to make civil assessments. Paragraph 241(4)(a) of the ITA also authorizes this. A CRA official may provide to another division of the CRA documents obtained if these documents can reasonably be regarded as necessary for the administration or enforcement of the ITA. Paragraph (4)(a) reads as follows:\n(4) An official may:\n(a) provide to any person taxpayer information that can reasonably be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the administration or enforcement of this Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Unemployment Insurance Act or the Employment Insurance Act, solely for that purpose.\n[52] That being said, the principles set out in Jarvis will have to be followed when an audit becomes a criminal investigation. Section 8 of the Charter will also apply if a taxpayer proves that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy over the seized documents. The existence of such an expectation will depend on the totality of the circumstances and the context.\n[53] The applicants argue that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the seized documents at issue. They submit that the documents must be kept confidential because no charges have been laid against them.\n[54] The applicants relied on the same argument in their cases before Gagn\u00e9 J. of the Federal Court of Canada. Gagn\u00e9 J. wrote the following at paragraph 79 of her reasons:\n[29] Contrary to what the applicants think, the principle developed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Piersanti is not based on the fact that, in that case, the applicant had pleaded guilty to 35 charges. The principle that information gathered in a criminal investigation may be used to reassess without contravening the Jarvis rule applies, in my humble opinion, regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation.\n[55] I agree with Gagn\u00e9 J.\u2019s comments. In Brown, Mr. Brown had not been found guilty because the charges had been withdrawn. As a result, the outcome of the criminal investigation is irrelevant.\n[56] The applicants further argue that a taxpayer\u2019s right to privacy is limited only with respect to the records and books that they are required to keep pursuant to subsection 230(1) of the ITA. However, the applicants argue that seized documents other than those described in subsection 230(1) \u2013 in this case emails written by third parties \u2013 must remain confidential.\n[57] The applicants also submit that during the computer search, the Criminal Investigations Division seized several new documents and a large amount of computer data. In addition, the active server that was seized allowed the CRA to obtain a copy of the data backups on the computers of SPE network users, which included the contents of Mr. Mavrovic\u2019s email box and his personal files. The applicants also submit that personal documents were seized in the bedroom of Mr. Plante and Ms. Grenier and that those documents had no connection with the tax transactions.\n[58] The applicants also argue that, in this case, unlike in Brown, the criminal search allowed the CRA to obtain documents that it would not have obtained during the audit. The applicants therefore argue that they had an expectation of privacy and that the seized documents must be excluded from the evidence under subsection 24(2) of the Charter.\n[59] First, the search warrant authorized the CRA to search the residence of Mr. Plante and his spouse Ms. Grenier as well as the premises of SPE, SPE Affacturage and SPEQ SPE Technologies. In addition, the search warrant authorized the seizure of all computer equipment[12]. The applicants cannot challenge this before our Court. I need not decide whether the seizures were unreasonable. If the applicants were of the view that the seizures were unreasonable, they had to challenge them before a provincial court. Our Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to determining whether the assessments are valid.\n[60] In this case, I must determine whether section 8 of the Charter has been violated. I must therefore decide whether the applicants had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the documents that the respondent seeks to enter into evidence, and not over all the documents that were seized during the searches. The vast majority of documents at issue are emails from Mr. Mavrovic[13]. Mr. Mavrovic played an important role in the tax transactions at issue.\n[61] In R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd.[14], Wilson J. of the Supreme Court of Canada stated that a taxpayer\u2019s privacy interest is quite low with regard to documents sought through requirements for information; the documents simply need to be relevant to the filing of income tax returns, i.e. the income tax liability.\n[62] In Jarvis[15], the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that the expectation of privacy in the context of the ITA is very limited:\n95 With respect to the consequences related to s. 8 of the Charter, McKinlay Transport, supra, makes it clear that taxpayers have very little privacy interest in the materials and records that they are obliged to keep under the ITA, and that they are obliged to produce during an audit. [\u2026] That is, there is no principle of use immunity that prevents the investigators, in the exercise of their investigative function, from making use of evidence obtained through the proper exercise of the CCRA\u2019s audit function [\u2026]\n[My emphasis.]\n[63] Although McKinlay and Jarvis apply in civil matters, in Brown, Dawson J., relying on the principles set out in Jarvis, determined that documents seized during a criminal search could be admitted into evidence in an appeal from an assessment. With respect to the confidentiality of documents in tax matters, she wrote the following in paragraph 22 of her reasons:\nAs to judicial authority, the jurisprudence does not support on an objective basis any significant expectation of privacy. As the Judge noted, in Jarvis (at paragraph 95) the Supreme Court observed that \u201ctaxpayers have very little privacy interest in the materials and records that they are obliged to keep under the [Act], and that they are obliged to produce during an audit.\u201d\n[64] Therefore, in the light of the case law, I do not agree with the applicants that a taxpayer\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy is limited only with respect to records and books referred to in subsection 230(1) of the ITA. As I have already indicated, Jarvis makes it clear that taxpayers have very little privacy interest in the records and books that they are required to keep under subsection 230(1) and that they are required to produce during an audit. In addition, under McKinlay stated that, in the context of requirements for information, taxpayers have little expectation of privacy in relation to the determination of their tax liability.\n[65] In addition, the applicants did not demonstrate at the hearing of the appeals on the merits or the hearing of the motion at issue in this case, that the CRA could not have issued requirements for information to obtain the documents at issue [16] for purposes of an audit.\n[66] In any event, the documents that the respondent wishes to enter into evidence are related to the tax transactions at issue of the applicants. The applicants have not cited, in support of their position, any authority to the effect that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The fact that the documents were written by a third party, Mr. Mavrovic, is not a sufficient reason.[17] I fail to see how the applicants could have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The emails were seized from SPE\u2019s active server. The emails in question concern the tax transactions at issue made by the applicants. They are not personal emails from Mr. Mavrovic.\n[67] Therefore, I am of the view that the rights guaranteed under section 8 of the Charter have not been violated. The documents at issue are therefore admissible as evidence in the appeals on the merits. The objections made by the applicants concerning the filing of these documents as evidence are dismissed.\n[68] Costs in the cause.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 27th day of August 2019.\n\u201cJohanne D\u2019Auray\u201d\nD\u2019Auray J.\nTranslation certified true\non this 7th day of February 2020.\nFran\u00e7ois Brunet, Revisor\nAPPENDIX 1\nThe documents filed as Exhibit I-1, tabs 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75 to 78, 80 to 91, 94, 97, 99, 102, 104, 105 to 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120 and 122, and the documents filed as Exhibit I-6, tab 24.\nCITATION:\n2019 TCC 174\nCOURT FILE NOS.:\n2015-1917(IT)G and 2015-1921(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSPE VALEUR ASSURABLE INC.\nv.

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2023 TCC 146\nDate: 20240320\nDocket: 2022-1553(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nMICHAEL DiPIERDOMENICO,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nAMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Applicant, Mr. DiPierdomenico, is a mail carrier for Canada Post in Windsor, Ontario. At one time, he also owned a nail salon. That business was audited by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d). The CRA says that the audit concluded with the sending of notices of reassessment for his 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 taxation years, but the Applicant did not serve a notice of objection in time to challenge those reassessments nor did he timely file an application with the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The Applicant says that he never saw any notices of reassessment until retaining his agent, Mr. Fraser Simpson, in late 2019 or early 2020. Mr. Simpson filed an application to this Court on June 9, 2022 for an extension of time to object to those reassessments.[1]\n[3] The Applicant wishes to challenge the reassessments and, to that end, asks this Court to allow his application for an extension of time to object.\nThe Applicant\u2019s Position\n[4] The Applicant says that he \u201cdid not receive the notice [sic] of reassessments\u201d.[2]\nThe Applicant\u2019s Evidence\n[5] The Court heard the Applicant\u2019s evidence virtually and received evidence from the Respondent by way of affidavits from officers of the CRA.\n[6] While hearing the Applicant give his evidence, I was struck by the absence of any records and the vagueness of his recollection. Before the hearing, the Court granted leave for him to testify virtually from his home in Windsor, Ontario. One would have thought that the Applicant would have all relevant documents before him, but he did not ask the Court to enter a single document as evidence.\n[7] For example, the Applicant testified that the CRA correspondence was \u201csporadic at best\u201d but produced no copy or record of any such correspondence. That is an important point as the Applicant rested his case on the non-receipt of notices of reassessment. Did he receive any mail from the CRA? If so, when? Did he receive any mail from other senders? This allegation lacked any factual foundation which is strange, particularly as the Applicant himself is a mail carrier.\n[8] The affidavit evidence offered by the Respondent helped fill numerous gaps in the Applicant\u2019s vague recollection of dates and events. The Applicant adduced no credible evidence to rebut any of the facts in the CRA\u2019s affidavits.\nStatutory Provisions\n[9] I will deal with the reassessments in two groups. The first are the reassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2011, 2012, and 2013 taxation years. The second are the reassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 taxation years. Before doing so, however, I will set out the relevant provisions of the Act and would note that the word \u201cassessment\u201d includes a \u201creassessment\u201d (subsection 248(1) of the Act):\nObjections to assessment\n165(1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual \u2026 on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; \u2026\nExtension of time by Minister\n166.1(1) Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165 \u2026 within the time limited \u2026 for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection \u2026\nWhen order to be made\n166.1(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection \u2026 and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice \u2026 the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2(1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\nWhen application to be granted\n166.2(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection \u2026 and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice \u2026 the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\nReassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2011, 2012, and 2013 Taxation Years\n[10] The CRA says that it sent the following notices of reassessment by mail to the Applicant on the following date:\nNotice of Reassessment for 2011 July 4, 2016\nNotice of Reassessment for 2012 July 4, 2016\nNotice of Reassessment for 2013 July 4, 2016\n[11] The Applicant claims that he did not receive those notices of reassessment. He asks me to conclude that the Minister did not send him those notices on the date indicated on each notice. This is important because under subsection 165(1) of the Act, it is only upon the sending of a notice of assessment or reassessment that the 90-day deadline to serve a notice of objection on the Minister begins to run:\nObjections to assessment\n165(1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual \u2026 on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; \u2026\n[emphasis added]\n[12] For the following reasons, I cannot accept the Applicant\u2019s claim that the Minister did not send him notices of reassessment for 2011, 2012 and 2013 on July 4, 2016:\nthe Applicant confirmed that his address on record with the CRA was indeed his address from 2013 to 2020;\neach notice of reassessment bears that address; and\nthe Applicant sent the Minister a notice of objection in respect of those reassessments.\n[13] The Applicant\u2019s notice of objection was not served until January, 2017 which was well beyond the 90-day deadline set out in subparagraph 165(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. One week after receiving the notice of objection, the CRA wrote to the Applicant informing him that his notice of objection was not validly served as it was not received within the 90-day deadline. The letter went on to say that the Applicant had one year from the expiration of the 90-day period to apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection.[3]\n[14] The Applicant did file an application with the Minister for an extension of time but he waited until May, 2018 to do so. By then, he was beyond the one-year period to apply to the Minister for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection under paragraph 166.1(7)(a) of the Act. That period expired in early October, 2017.[4]\n[15] In light of these facts, the Applicant\u2019s agent made no argument in support of the Applicant\u2019s position that notices of reassessment for the 2011, 2012, or 2013 taxation years had not been sent to him by the Minister on July 4, 2016.\nReassessments for the Applicant\u2019s 2015 and 2016 Taxation Years\n[16] The CRA says that it sent the following notices of reassessment to the Applicant by electronic mail on the following dates:\nNotice of Reassessment for 2015 January 6, 2021\nNotice of Reassessment for 2016 December 24, 2020\n[17] Why did the CRA send those notices by electronic mail? Because the Applicant authorized the CRA to do so.[5] The Applicant enrolled in what the CRA calls \u201cMy Account\u201d which is a secure electronic account from which taxpayers may access correspondence sent to them by the CRA including, among other things, notices of assessment and reassessment.\n[18] The problem here is that the Applicant never filed an application for extension of time with the Minister to serve a notice of objection in respect of the reassessments for his 2015 and 2016 taxation years under section 166.1 of the Act. Such an application must have been made before an applicant may apply to this Court for an extension of time. Subsection 166.2(1) of the Act provides:\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2(1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\n[emphasis added]\n[19] As set out in the Affidavit of Ms. Michele Nguyen of the CRA[6], the Applicant never applied to the Minister for an extension of time to serve notices of objection in respect of his 2015 and 2016 reassessments.[7] That is the end of the matter because subsection 166.2(1) then precludes the Applicant from applying to this Court for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection.\n[20] The Applicant\u2019s failure to meet the condition precedent to apply to this Court for an extension of time is fatal to his application in respect of 2015 and 2016. I will nevertheless review several provisions of the Act dealing with presumptions around the fact of electronic sending and the date of electronic sending as they may become relevant in other applications.\nElectronic Sending of a Notice \u2013 Subsection 244(6.1) of the Act\n[21] The Minister may prove the sending of a notice electronically under subsection 244(6.1) of the Act:\nProof of electronic delivery\n244(6.1) If, by this Act or a regulation, provision is made for sending a notice to a person electronically, an affidavit of an officer of the Canada Revenue Agency sworn before a commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be received as evidence of the sending and of the notice if the affidavit sets out that\n(a) the officer has knowledge of the facts in the particular case;\n(b) the notice was sent electronically to the person on a named day; and\n(c) the officer identifies as exhibits attached to the affidavit copies of\n(i) an electronic message confirming the notice has been sent to the person, and\n(ii) the notice.\n[22] All but one of the requirements of subsection 244(6.1) were met by the Affidavit of Ms. Felicia Colasante of the CRA.[8] Subparagraph 244(6.1)(c)(ii) requires that a CRA officer attach a copy of the notice as an exhibit to an affidavit. Though copies of the notices of reassessment were not attached as exhibits to the Affidavit of Ms. Colasante, they were attached as exhibits to the Affidavit of Ms. Nguyen who attached a reproduction of the notice of reassessment for 2015 as Exhibit \u201cK\u201d and a reproduction of the notice of reassessment for 2016 as Exhibit \u201cL\u201d to her affidavit.\n[23] In my view, the affidavits of Ms. Colasante and Ms. Nguyen, when read together, would meet the requirements of subsection 244(6.1) of the Act. As the Applicant offered no proof to the contrary, I would have received the affidavits of Ms. Colasante and Ms. Nguyen as evidence of the electronic sending of the notices of reassessment for 2015 and 2016.\nDate of Electronic Sending of a Notice \u2013 Subsection 244(14.1) of the Act\n[24] Subsections 244(14) and 244(14.1) of the Act describe the conditions under which a notice is presumed to have been sent electronically by the Minister:\nMailing or sending date\n244(14) For the purposes of this Act, where \u2026 any notice of assessment \u2026 is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice \u2026.\nDate when electronic notice sent\n244(14.1) If a notice \u2026 in respect of an individual \u2026 is made available in electronic format such that it can be read or perceived by an individual or a computer system or other similar device, the notice \u2026 is presumed to be sent to the individual and received by the individual on the date that an electronic message is sent, to the electronic address most recently provided by the individual to the Minister for the purposes of this subsection, informing the individual that a notice \u2026 requiring the individual\u2019s immediate attention is available in the individual\u2019s secure electronic account. A notice \u2026 is considered to be made available if it is posted by the Minister in the individual\u2019s secure electronic account and the individual has authorized that notices or other communications may be made available in this manner and has not before that date revoked that authorization in a manner specified by the Minister.\n[25] Ms. Colasante\u2019s review of the CRA\u2019s records showed that:\na)the Applicant elected to receive email notifications on March 10, 2020 to the email address ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a printout of the screenshot of the Applicant\u2019s record of email address registration, with the Applicant\u2019s social insurance number redacted;\nb)the Applicant\u2019s Reassessment Notices for the 2015 and 2016 taxation years were made available on My Account on January 6, 2021 and December 24, 2020, respectively. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cB\u201d is a printout of the screenshot of the Applicant\u2019s account in the Agency\u2019s Enterprise Correspondence History with respect to the Reassessments; and\nc)the Applicant was sent email notifications on January 6, 2021 and December 4, 2020 to ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||, their email address on file, informing them that there is new Eligible Agency Correspondence available for view in View Mail in the Agency\u2019s My Account portal on their account. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cC\u201d is a printout of the Correspondence Notification History Results, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s Reassessments and their electronic issuance, with the Applicant\u2019s social insurance number redacted.\nFor obvious reasons, the Applicant\u2019s email address has been redacted from the above excerpts.\n[26] As none of the CRA\u2019s evidence was rebutted by the Applicant, I would have made the following findings:\nThe Minister sent the Applicant a notice of reassessment for his 2015 taxation year by electronic mail on January 6, 2021.[9]\nThe Minister sent the Applicant a notice of reassessment for his 2016 taxation year by electronic mail on December 24, 2020.[10]\nConclusions\n[27] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed an application with the Minister for an extension of time to object to the reassessments for his 2011, 2012, and 2013 taxation years was October 3, 2017. He did not do so until May 18, 2018. His application fails because it was not made within the time required by paragraph 166.2(5)(a) of the Act.\n[28] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object to the reassessment for his 2015 taxation year was April 6, 2022. He never did so and is, therefore, precluded from applying to this Court by the final words of subsection 166.2(1) of the Act.\n[29] The last date on which the Applicant could have filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object to the reassessment for his 2016 taxation year was March 24, 2022.

THE MOTION\n[1] The appellants (to be referred to collectively as the applicants in these reasons) brought a motion (the Motion), notice of which is dated January 26, 2023, including Robert Plante\u2019s affidavit dated January 24, 2023, asking the Court to allow the appeals filed by the applicants and vacate the reassessments made by the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) under the Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the Act), namely:\n-In the docket involving Robert Plante (Mr. Plant)(No. 2015-1921(IT)G): the reassessments in respect of the 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 taxation years;\n-In the docket involving SPE Valeur Assurable Inc. (SPE) (No. 2015-1917(IT)G): the reassessments in respect of the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years;\n[2] In support of their motions, the applicants claim that the delays incurred in these cases following the trial held in the fall of 2017 without a decision having been rendered by the Court to date, and the options that they were given by the Court, either to hold a new trial before a new judge or to have a new judge render judgment on the basis of the records, would result in an abuse of process because there is either a breach of procedural fairness or inordinate judicial delay. According to the applicants, as a remedy for this abuse of process, the Court should allow the applicants\u2019 appeals and vacate the reassessments.\n[3] Alternatively, the applicants argue that holding a new trial would violate the rights of Mr. Plant guaranteed by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982, (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the Charter).\nII. CONCLUSION\n[4] For the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.\n[5] The Court orders that a judgment on the merits of these appeals be rendered on the basis of the records; If the parties wish to make additional submissions regarding the issues in dispute in these appeals, they should contact the Hearings Coordinator no later than June 15, 2023 to notify the Court and, in such case:\n(i)The parties must file their written submissions no later than September 29, 2023;\n(ii)The oral submissions of the parties will be heard during a hearing lasting no more than two (2) consecutive days which must be held in October or November 2023; the parties must notify the Court of their joint availability no later than June 15, 2023, for such a hearing.\nThe Court reserves the right to recall any witness who testified during the hearing held in October and November 2017.\nIII. APPEALS BEFORE THE COURT\nWith respect to SPE:\n[6] The appeal concerns the 2005 to 2009 taxation years. Under the reassessments made by the Minister outside the normal reassessment period, deductions totalling $1,089,129 claimed in computing SPE\u2019s income as business expenses were disallowed under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act. The Minister argued that SPE claimed false marketing expenses, commission fees and prepaid U.S. marketing expenses with respect to six purported U.S. marketing companies. In addition, penalties were assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act for all taxation years.\n[7] Further, the Minister argued that SPE made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or committed a fraud in filing its returns or in supplying any information for the 2005 to 2009 taxation years, and that it knowingly, or under circumstances, amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or omission in the income tax returns it filed for the 2005 to 2009 taxation years.\n[8] For its part, SPE claimed that these marketing, commission and release expenses were incurred in order to market SPE\u2019s product, i.e. the asset management software, in a genuine business operations context. Also, reassessing outside the normal reassessment period or assessing penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act is not warranted because SPE acted in good faith.\nWith respect to Mr. Plante:\n[9] The appeal concerns the 2003 to 2008 taxation years. Under the reassessments made by the Minister outside the normal reassessment period, amounts totalling $1,526,144 were added to Mr. Plante\u2019s income as indirect payments under subsection 56(2) of the Act for the 2004 to 2008 taxation years, and expenses totalling $13,128 were disallowed for the 2003 taxation year. The amounts so added to Mr. Plante\u2019s income represent the marketing expenses that SPE claimed as a deduction but were disallowed. In addition, penalties were assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act for all taxation years.\n[10] The Minister argued that, following Mr. Plante\u2019s instructions, SPE transferred the above amounts from his bank account to the bank accounts of purported U.S. marketing companies so that Mr. Plante could appropriate these funds for his personal benefit and to benefit certain acquaintances. He further argued that if SPE had paid these amounts directly to Mr. Plante, he should have included these amounts in computing his income under subsection 15(1) of the Act.\n[11] Furthermore, the Minister argued that Mr. Plant made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or committed a fraud in filing his returns or in supplying any information for the 2003 to 2008 taxation years, and that he knowingly, or under circumstances, amounting to gross negligence, made a false statement or omission in the income tax returns he filed for the 2003 to 2008 taxation years.\n[12] For his part, Mr. Plante argued that the reassessments should be vacated because he had always acted in good faith. He further argued that the amounts added to his income should not be included in his income because they represented expenses incurred to meet the commitments that SPE made to various U.S. commercial agents, in a genuine business operations context, and that the funds received were promissory notes for loans.\nIV. CHRONOLOGY\n[13] The applicants\u2019 files are part of a group of seventeen (17) files, most of which have been suspended pending a decision in the applicants\u2019 cases.\n[14] The chronology is as follows:\nApril 29, 2015: filing of notices of appeal by the applicants;\nJuly 22, 2016: joint applications by the parties to schedule the hearing of the appeals;\nDecember 12, 2016: Court order fixing the hearing of these appeals on Monday, October 30, 2017 for a period of five days;\nOctober 26, 2017: letter from the applicants asking the Court for leave to hold a preliminary hearing on the admissibility of certain documents in evidence during the hearing scheduled to begin on October 30, 2017;\nOctober 30 and 31, 2017, and November 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, 2017, (eight days): hearing of appeals;\nNovember 9, 2017: the presiding trial judge (the presiding judge) reserved her decision on the cases, subject to a motion, to be presented by the appellants, i.e. the applicants in this case, to exclude certain evidence obtained by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) during a search and filed in evidence at the hearing;\nMarch 19, 2018: the motion for exclusion of certain evidence obtained by the CRA during a search pursuant to sections 8 and 24(2) of the Charter was filed with the Court by the applicants (motion for exclusion of evidence);\nFebruary 11, 2019: the motion for exclusion of evidence was heard by the presiding judge;\nAugust 27, 2019: the presiding judge dismissed the motion for exclusion of evidence according to the reasons given in 2019 TCC 174;\nOctober 11, 2019: the applicants brought an appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal against the decision of this Court dismissing the motion for exclusion of evidence;\nOctober 22, 2019: the registry of the Federal Court of Appeal notified the Clerk of this Court that an appeal had been filed in the applicants\u2019 records;\nJanuary 20, 2020: the Federal Court of Appeal made an order staying the proceedings before it without dismissing the appeal and held that the applicants could appeal the decision on the admissibility of evidence in the context of the appeal, if any, of the decision on the merits (Docket No. A-391-19);\nJuly 23 and 26, 2021: the respondent contacted the Court to inquire about the status of the decision on the merits of the appeals heard by the Court in October and November 2017;\nJuly 27, 2021: the Court docket recorded the order of the Federal Court of Appeal dated January 20, 2020;\nAugust 5, 2021: the presiding judge held a hearing management conference in which she advised the parties that the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s January 20, 2020, order had not been brought to her attention and recorded in the Court docket until July 27, 2021, and that she would render her decision on the merits before the end of September 2021;\nMarch 30, 2022: during a case management conference held by the Court before the Honourable Mr. Justice Boyle, on behalf of the Chief Justice, the parties were advised that the presiding judge had retired for medical reasons on April 4, 2022, without any decision on the merits having been rendered in their cases. The Court gave the parties two options: it could either order a new trial before a judge to be appointed by the Chief Justice, or have a judge appointed by the Chief Justice render judgment on the basis of the records (transcripts and documents filed in evidence during the hearing of the appeals) and according to the terms and conditions to be determined by the new judge. If the parties decided that a new trial was required, that trial would be scheduled before a new judge. If the parties consented to having a judge render judgment on the basis of the records, the Court indicated that this judge would communicate with the parties to inform them of what he would need to render judgment in terms of additional submissions or any other terms and conditions. The parties were required to announce their choices if there was an agreement between them no later than April 15, 2022, or, in the event of a disagreement between them, the parties were required submit written submissions to the Chief Justice no later than April 29, 2022;\nApril 29, 2022: the applicants indicated to the Chief Justice that they reached an agreement with the respondent and chose to proceed as follows:\n[translation] In this regard, we propose that all the testimonial and documentary evidence adduced in the first trial be similarly adduced for the purposes of the new hearing (taking into account the objections made by the parties). This second trial would be limited to a review of the evidence by the parties, and to the arguments, which would be repeated in their entirety. This procedure would not take as long and would allow the parties, among other things, to inform the Court of the material evidence and answer questions that could be raised by the new judge assigned to the case.\nMay 31, 2022: the Court held another case management conference before Boyle J., on behalf of the Chief Justice: the Court noted the parties\u2019 choice as described in their April 29, 2022, letter, i.e. that a hearing was scheduled to allow the parties to review the evidence and present their submissions. Thus, the hearing was scheduled to be held in Qu\u00e9bec during the months of June 2023, or thereafter, depending on how long the parties wanted the hearing to last (three days). The parties indicated that they could possibly make themselves available for a hearing to be held in Montreal during the winter of 2023. The parties were advised that the next step would probably be a hearing management conference chaired by the judge appointed by the Chief Justice to render judgment on these cases;\nOctober 21, 2022: the applicants indicated that they were not available on the dates proposed by the Court for hearing these cases and asked to have a management conference scheduled;\nNovember 10, 2022: having been appointed by the Chief Justice to rule on these cases, I held a hearing management conference. The applicants then advised the Court that they wished to present a motion prior to the hearing to argue that the appeals should be allowed and the reassessments vacated in both of the applicants\u2019 cases, on the grounds of breach of the principles of procedural fairness. Therefore, no hearing date was set because the applicants rejected their own proposal, as described in the April 29, 2022, letter;\nJanuary 9, 2023: the Court held a new case management conference before Boyle J., on behalf of the Chief Justice. The Court reminded the parties of the two options available to them for continuing the case: either a new trial could be held or a judge appointed by the Chief Justice could render judgment on the basis of the records, according to the terms and conditions to be determined by that judge. The applicants again asked for leave to present a preliminary motion. The Court granted the applicants leave to file the preliminary motion no later than January 24, 2023. No hearing date was set at that time;\nJanuary 24, 2023: I held a new hearing management conference during which I reminded the parties that the options given by the Court were either to hold a new trial before a new judge appointed by the Chief Justice, or that a new judge appointed by the Chief Justice render judgment on the basis of the records, according to the terms and conditions to be determined by this judge, if applicable. The applicants claimed that they refused to proceed with either of the options given by the Court or in the manner described in the April 29, 2022, letter, given the time that had elapsed since that date. They also indicated that they were prepared to file the preliminary motion referred to last November.\nV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nThe applicants:\n[15] The applicants do not dispute the power of the Chief Justice of the Court to reassign cases to another judge of the Court. However, the applicants argue that the process put in place by the Court is not fair to the applicants and results in an abuse of process, as this doctrine is known and applied in the context of administrative law.\n[16] According to the applicants, the two options proposed by the Court after the departure of the presiding judge\u2014either a new trial or a judgment rendered on the basis of the records (according to terms and conditions to be determined by a new judge)\u2014result in an abuse of process, given the lack of procedural fairness for the applicants under either option given to the parties. Even if the Court finds that there is no breach of procedural fairness, there would be abuse of process resulting from the judicial delays in these cases for which the applicants are not responsible.\n[17] According to the applicants, since the concept of abuse of process in administrative law is very flexible, it must be applied because it is not limited to the administrative decision maker and must be interpreted broadly. Abuse of process is applicable in various contexts and particularly in these cases.\n[18] The applicants agree that this motion is unusual and that the issues raised by the motion have never been considered by the Court. According to the applicants, the Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the applicants, i.e. to allow the appeals in these cases and vacate the reassessments on the grounds of abuse of process by the Court. According to the applicants, the cases of Mr. Plante and SPE are exceptional cases requiring extraordinary intervention by the Court.\n[19] First of all, the option of holding a new trial would be acceptable in principle to the applicants, but they cannot acquiesce in it. Holding a new trial would tarnish the image of justice because there could be no guarantee that a new trial would ensure procedural fairness, which would result in an abuse of process. The applicants cite the time that has elapsed since 2017, the difficulty of finding certain witnesses, the failing memory of the witnesses as well as the hardship Mr. Plante and SPE would suffer it they had to obtain legal services given the estimated professional fees for representation in a new trial (paragraphs 38 to 39).\n[20] Alternatively, the applicants argue that holding a new trial would infringe Mr. Plante\u2019s rights under section 7 of the Charter. In this case, Mr. Plante\u2019s security and psychological integrity would be compromised by holding a new trial (Mr. Plante\u2019s affidavit, paragraph 40).\n[21] The second option given by the Court, that a judge render judgment on the basis of the record, is also unacceptable to the applicants. The principle that it is the judge who presided over the trial who renders judgment is based on the rule that the parties have the right to be heard. In the event that another judge renders judgment, this rule is not followed and consequently, procedural fairness is not observed. However, the applicants agree that the availability of the audio recordings of the hearing reduces the scope of this argument, but does not completely eliminate it. Also, the records are very extensive. Several documents were introduced in evidence and some documents were produced on computer media.\n[22] In addition, the judge who must rule on the case is bound by all decisions made by the presiding judge during the trial. According to the applicants, the Court cannot order such a mode of operation without consent of the parties.\n[23] For these reasons, the applicants cannot accede to the Court\u2019s request, and ask that the appeals be allowed and the reassessments vacated.\nThe respondent:\n[24] According to the respondent, since the Court is a judicial tribunal, the doctrine of abuse of process in administrative law cannot apply to decisions or orders of the Court relating to its own process. Also, the Court likely lacks jurisdiction to allow appeals and vacate reassessments on the grounds of abuse of process, as this doctrine is known in administrative law. For these above reasons, this motion should be dismissed.\n[25] Even if the doctrine of abuse of process in administrative law were applicable in this case, which the respondent disputes, although the 26-month delay or the eight months since the presiding judge reserved judgment was considerable, the delay was not excessive. The starting point of the delay was either January 20, 2020, (order of the Federal Court of Appeal on the motion for exclusion of evidence), or July 27, 2021, (entry of the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s order in the Court\u2019s docket) and ends in March 2022, when the Court notified the parties of the presiding judge\u2019s departure. Therefore, allowing the appeals and vacating the reassessments on this ground would not be warranted. In this case, the interests of justice require that a decision be rendered by the Court in a trial that has been completed. It is the absence of a decision on the merits that would constitute a denial of justice, and not the contrary.\n[26] Pursuant to the application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication, a judge of the Court appointed by the Chief Justice to continue the applicants\u2019 cases may decide the process to be followed by ensuring that the parties have a fair trial, which could be either to render judgment on the basis of the records or to order that a new trial be held, even without the agreement of the parties (D\u2019Amico v. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785 [D\u2019Amico], at paragraph 44).\n[27] Finally, according to the respondent, the applicants\u2019 argument concerning section 7 of the Charter cannot be accepted, since court orders are not subject to the Charter (section 32 of the Charter; see also RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573 [RWDSU], at paragraphs 34 and 36 and McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at paragraphs 157 and 158). Also, it is well established that economic rights are not covered by section 7 of the Charter, which includes tax assessments (Gratl v. Canada, 2012 FCA 88, at paragraph 8). It therefore follows that the delay in obtaining a decision involving a right not covered by the Charter cannot be protected by the Charter.\n[28] According to the respondent, the following factors weigh in favour of the option of rendering judgment on the record: the evidence is in, the pleadings are closed, the cross-examinations have been completed to the satisfaction of the parties, and the Court not only has access to the transcripts, but to the audio recording of the hearing. Moreover, Mr. Plante\u2019s affidavit documents real hardship if a new trial were ordered.\nVI. DISCUSSION\nTHE MOTION\n[29] This motion is dismissed for the following reasons.\n[30] First, the Court lacks jurisdiction to allow the appeals and vacate the reassessments on the grounds that the Court would be abusing its own processes.\n[31] Also, the concept of abuse of process in administrative law cannot apply to decisions or orders of the Court relating to its own processes, since the Court is a judicial tribunal. However, even if the concept of abuse of process in administrative law were applicable, the Court finds that neither option given to the parties to continue the cases breaches procedural fairness. The Court also finds that the judicial delay in these cases is not excessive.\nJurisdiction of the Court and doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication:\n[32] For the following reasons, neither the powers conferred by statute nor the powers necessarily inferred from the power to constitute a court of justice (by application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication) enable the Court to allow the appeals and vacate the reassessments on the grounds that the Court would be abusing its own processes.\n[33] The applicants did not cite any case law on the application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication that would otherwise give the Court inherent power to remedy an abuse of its own processes by allowing the appeals and vacating the reassessments. At the hearing, both parties indicated that they could not find any decisions dealing with this issue. The reason is quite simple. The Court simply does not have this power.\n[34] The jurisdiction of the Court is determined by the Tax Court of Canada Act (RSC (1985), c. T-2, as amended, at section 12) and is limited to:\n\u201cdetermin[ing] the validity and correctness of the assessment based on the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and the facts giving rise to the taxpayer\u2019s statutory liability\u201d (Ereiser v. Canada, 2013 FCA 20, at paragraph 31).\n[35] Section 171 of the Act sets out the powers of the Court on an appeal of an assessment under the Act:\n\u201cThe Tax Court of Canada may dispose of an appeal by\n(a) dismissing it; or\n(b) allowing it and\n(i) vacating the assessment,\n(ii) varying the assessment, or\n(iii) referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\u201d\n[36] It is also well established in the jurisprudence that the Court does not have jurisdiction to vacate an assessment on the basis of an abuse of power or unfairness that gave rise to making the assessment (Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250, at paragraph 83).\n[37] In Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403 [Main Rehabilitation], at paragraph 6, the Federal Court of Appeal held that it was \u201cplain and obvious that the Tax Court does not have the jurisdiction to set aside an assessment on the basis of an abuse of process at common law or in breach of section 7 of the Charter.\u201d As indicated by the Federal Court of Appeal, this is because the appeal filed under section 169 of the Act challenges the validity of the assessment and not the process by which it is established (at paragraph 8).\n[38] In addition to jurisdiction fixed by statute, the Court, like any other court, possesses all powers determined by the application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication. In R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10 [Cunningham], the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following:\n[19] Likewise in the case of statutory courts, the authority to control the court\u2019s process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law. This Court has affirmed that courts can apply a \u201cdoctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication\u201d when determining the powers of a statutory tribunal:\n. . . the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime. . .\n(ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 51)\nAlthough Bastarache J. was referring to an administrative tribunal, the same rule of jurisdiction, by necessary implication, would apply to statutory courts.\n(Emphasis added)\n[39] The Federal Court of Appeal recently affirmed this principle in High-Crest Enterprises Limited v. Canada, 2017 FCA 88 [High-Crest] (at paragraph 39).\n[40] This jurisdiction by necessary implication allows the Chief Justice of the Court to reassign a case to another judge of the Court when a judge has ceased to hold office (High-Crest, at paragraphs 17 to 40), which the applicants recognized at the hearing and do not dispute.\n[41] As the respondent indicated, pursuant to the application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication, a judge of the Court appointed by the Chief Justice to continue the applicants\u2019 cases may decide the process to be followed by ensuring that the parties have a fair trial, which could be to render judgment on the basis of the records or order that a new trial be held, even without the agreement of the parties (D\u2019Amico, at paragraph 44).\n[42] By application of the doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication, the judges of the Court have the authority to control the Court\u2019s process and oversee the conduct of counsel. This authority is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law (Cunningham, at paragraph 19).\n[43] The Supreme Court of Canada stated the following:\n35 Judges have an inherent and residual discretion to prevent an abuse of the court\u2019s process (. . .)\n[44] In Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 [City of Toronto], the Supreme Court of Canada defined the concept of abuse of process at common law as proceedings unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice and as oppressive treatment and indicated that its primary focus is to preserve the integrity of the adjudicative functions of courts (City of Toronto, at paragraphs 35 and 43). More specifically, the concept of abuse of process at common law was described therein as follows:\n37 (. . .) Goudge J.A. expanded on that concept in the following terms at paras. 55-56:\nThe doctrine of abuse of process engages the inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a way that would be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation before it or would in some other way bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is a flexible doctrine unencumbered by the specific requirements of concepts such as issue estoppel. (See House of Spring Gardens Ltd. v. Waite, [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347, at p. 358, [1990] 2 All E.R. 990 (C.A.).\n(Emphasis added)\n[45] Thus, the Court may take all the measures it deems necessary and appropriate to control the Court\u2019s process when a party abuses it, but not when a party claims that it is the Court itself that abuses its own process. For instance, in Yacyshyn v. Canada (1999), 99 D.T.C. 5133, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that there had been an abuse of process by the Court because the appellant had not met its obligations with respect to examinations for discovery, and accordingly the Court had the power to strike out certain parts of the allegations in the Notice of Appeal (see also Main Rehabilitation, at paragraph 7).\n[46] The Court would also be permitted to terminate litigation in the event that an issue had already been decided beforehand (for example, if there was a res judicata).\n[47] More recently, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed the power of the Court to prevent and control an abuse of its process by awarding costs and expenses against one of the parties (Fournier v. Canada, 2005 FCA 131, at paragraph 11).\n[48] The Court is also allowed to terminate litigation where the evidence in support of the assessment made outside the normal reassessment period was obtained in violation of section 8 of the Charter (Canada v. O\u2019Neill Motors Ltd. [1998] 4 F.C. 180 (C.A.)).\nAbuse of process due to inordinate delay in the administrative context\n[49] The applicants asked the Court to apply the doctrine of abuse of process in the event of inordinate delay in the administrative context with regard to the processes put in place by the Court itself to continue the applicants\u2019 cases, and not in relation to the conduct of the other parties to the dispute. In the context of this motion, the applicants did not raise any abusive or vexatious conduct by the respondent or the CRA, or any other abuse of process on the part of the other party to the dispute. Rather, the applicants cited the time it took the Court to manage the deliberations, which, according to them, would result in an abuse of process due to excessive delay, as this doctrine is applied in an administrative context.\n[50] To support their arguments, the applicants relied on Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44 [Blencoe], in which the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that unreasonable delay causing serious prejudice could constitute an abuse of process. They also cited the recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 [Abrametz], in which the Supreme Court of Canada once again addressed the concept of abuse of process in the event of inordinate delay in the administrative context (at paragraphs 33 to 34).\n[51] According to the Supreme Court of Canada, there are two situations in which a delay may constitute an abuse of process in an administrative context: (i) if the fairness of the hearing is compromised by the delay (where delay impairs a party\u2019s ability to answer a complaint because, for example, memories have faded, essential witnesses are no longer available, or evidence has been lost) (Blencoe, at paragraphs 101 to 102); and (ii) in cases where there is no prejudice to hearing fairness, if significant prejudice has been caused due to inordinate delay (Blencoe, at paragraphs 122 and 132).\n[52] When an abuse of process is noted, the courts must determine the appropriate remedies, which take various forms up to and including a stay of proceedings in the most obvious cases of abuse (Abrametz, at paragraphs 74 to 76; 83 to 85.\n[53] According to the Court, the Court\u2019s power to remedy an abuse of process cannot allow the Court to vacate reassessments and allow appeals on the basis of the time it takes a Court to manage deliberations. In interests of justice, a decision must be rendered on these appeals. As the respondent argued, if the Court were to agree to allow the applicants\u2019 appeals and vacate the reassessments, it would shock society\u2019s sense of fairness and decency, and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice (Abrametz, at paragraph 76 and Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at paragraph 96).\n[54] In addition, the Court is a judicial decision maker and not an administrative decision maker and is not a party to the dispute. Therefore, the concept of abuse of process due to delay in an administrative context is not applicable. The decisions cited by the applicants to support their arguments cannot be applied, because they all refer to the concept of abuse of process in an administrative context (City of Toronto, Blencoe and Abrametz).\n[55] The Court concurs with the comments of the Court in Lassonde v. The Queen, 2003 TCC 715 at paragraphs 133, 134 and 141, upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Appeal (Lassonde v. Canada, 2005 FCA 323). In that case, the Court dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s motion to have his appeal allowed and the assessments vacated for oppression and unreasonable delay by the Minister in making the assessment. The Court distinguished the principles set out in Blencoe and indicated:\n[133] An assessment under the Act is not a complaint or an accusation. It is simply an act determining a taxpayer\u2019s debt under the Act, within a self-assessment system.\n[134] In the issue dealt with in this motion, there is a portion that I feel is administrative law and another that is civil procedure. The administrative law portion is that which goes from the income tax return to the assessment. From the moment when an appeal of the assessment is instituted before this Court, which is a court of justice or civil court, it is no longer administrative law, but civil law.\n(. . .)\n[141] As we have just seen, an assessment cannot be vacated for lack of diligence in processing an assessment. Once proceedings have begun before this Court, it is the responsibility of the Appellant to request that the case be heard.\n(Emphasis added)\n[56] However, even if the Court had held that the concept of abuse of process due to delay in an administrative context was applicable to our Court, the delays incurred in the context of the applicants\u2019 cases do not give rise to the application of this concept, nor to the remedy sought by the applicants. Indeed, the Court found that if it ordered a new trial, the delay incurred in these cases would not affect the fairness of the hearing. The Court also found that the time that elapsed since judgment was reserved on these appeals was not excessive. The particular circumstances of these appeals must be taken into account in this case to assess this delay.\n[57] The applicants submitted that deliberations were not suspended on November 9, 2017, and that they were not responsible for the 26-month delay between November 2017 and January 2020, because the appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal in October 2019 was filed preemptively. According to the applicants, 53 months elapsed between November 2017 when the judge reserved judgment on the cases and the moment the parties were notified of the departure of the presiding judge, i.e. in March 2022.\n[58] The Court cannot accept the way the applicants calculated the delays. First of all, deliberations did not start on November 9, 2017. The presiding judge stated at the end of the hearing of the appeals that she was reserving judgment on these cases, subject to the motion for exclusion of evidence to be brought by the appellants, who are the applicants in this case:\n[translation] \u201c(. . .) thank you, and it behoves me to reserve judgment on this. Not only that, one way or another, I must wait until we proceed with the motion.\u201d (transcripts, November 9, 2017, at page 233, lines 7 to 10).\n[59] At the opening of the trial on Monday, October 30, 2017, the presiding judge expressed her displeasure with the applicants for the way they notified the Court of their intention to bring such a preliminary motion for exclusion of certain evidence, by simply sending the Court Registry a letter on Thursday, October 26, 2017, without following the Court\u2019s rules of procedure. Lengthy discussions continued on the morning of October 30, 2017, on how to proceed. They could either adjourn the hearing of the appeals scheduled for two weeks to allow the applicants to file a formal application, with affidavit and written submissions. Alternatively, they could proceed with the hearing of the appeals, subject to the applicants\u2019 objection to the respondent\u2019s filing the evidence obtained by the CRA in connection with the search, it being understood that this motion would be presented and heard at a time to be determined by the Court, depending on the availability of the parties, after the hearing of the appeals. As the presiding judge indicated:\n[translation] \u201cThis is why it\u2019s very unfortunate, but we\u2019re going about this the wrong way. But as I say, it\u2019s either that or we adjourn everything and come back next year\u201d (transcripts, October 30, 2017, at page 74, lines 7 to 10).\n[60] The applicants agreed at trial that the hearing of the appeals should be held as scheduled and that they would present their motion subsequently. It is therefore highly inappropriate for the applicants to complain about these delays today.\n[61] The presiding judge\u2019s decision on the motion to exclude evidence, heard in February 2019, was rendered on August 29, 2019, and appealed by the applicants in October 2019. The order of the Federal Court of Appeal was made on January 20, 2020, but registered at the Court Registry only at the end of July 2021. It should be noted that the order of the Federal Court of Appeal specified that no exceptional circumstances warranted immediate intervention of the Federal Court of Appeal in the applicants\u2019 cases, contrary to their claims. The Federal Court of Appeal also indicated in the order that it [translation] \u201c(. . .) would be particularly inappropriate in this case to further delay the delivery of the Tax Court of Canada\u2019s (TCC) judgment on the merits, especially since this judgment has been long awaited.\u201d\n[62] Approximately 10 months had elapsed between December 2016 when the appeals were scheduled for hearing and the start of the hearing of the appeals on October 30, 2017. However, the applicants sent a letter to the registry only two days prior to the start of the trial to indicate that they intended to present a preliminary motion for exclusion of evidence.\n[63] In view of the foregoing, the applicants can hardly complain of the time elapsed between November 2017 and January 2020.\n[64] Also, the Court finds that 18 months must be subtracted from the applicants\u2019 calculation of the delay, i.e. the delay between January 2020 (order of the Federal Court of Appeal) and July 2021 (when the order of the Federal Court of Appeal was registered in the Court docket). Between January 2020 and July 2021, the applicants should have contacted the Court when they noticed that the order of the Federal Court of Appeal had not been entered in the Court docket. However, the respondent looked after this at the end of July 2021 in order to enquire about the judgment on the merits of these appeals.\n[65] When all the circumstances are taken into consideration, it is quite astonishing that the applicants maintain that they are not responsible for the delays incurred in their cases.\n[66] Because the presiding judge left the Court eight (8) months after the order of the Federal Court of Appeal was entered in the Court docket, the Court finds that this delay cannot be characterized as inordinate, as understood by the concept of abuse of process in an administrative context.\n[67] In making this assessment, the Court took into account the Ethical Principles for Judges developed by the Canadian Judicial Council. Section 3.B.2 stipulates that reserved judgments should be delivered within six month after hearings, except in special circumstances.\nPROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED FOR THE NEXT STEPS\n[68] As the Federal Court of Appeal indicated in High-Crest, the new judge hearing the case will determine the procedure to be followed:\n[101] Following reassignment, the new judge is in charge of the case. It is for that judge, not the Chief Justice, to receive submissions from the parties concerning how the case should proceed, for example whether the case should be reheard or whether existing material (including transcripts) should be used in whole or in part: D\u2019Amico v. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785, 47 Alta. L.R. (5th) 414; Parmar v. Bayley, 2001 BCSC 1394, 19 C.P.C. (5th) 366.\n[69] To decide on the procedure to be followed, the Court must ensure that the parties get a fair trial that promotes [translation] \u201csound management of the case by applying proper, efficient procedures through fair, simple, proportionate and economical application of the proceedings\u201d (Schwimmer c. Gaudreault-Martel, 2022 QCCQ 1631 [Gaudreault-Martel], at paragraph 52) while respecting the principle of proportionality (Gaudreault-Martel, at paragraph 53) (written submissions of the respondent, at paragraphs 50 to 52). The Court, like any other court, must respect the principles of natural justice and ensure procedural fairness.\n[70] For the following reasons, the Court orders that a judgment on the merits of these appeals be rendered on the basis of the records. If they wish, the parties may submit additional oral and written submissions with respect to the issues in dispute in these appeals. The Court also reserves the right to recall any witness.\n[71] First, the Court finds that holding a new trial would likely be unfair to the applicants, since Mr. Plante stated that he could not afford his counsel\u2019s estimated legal fees for preparing for and conducting a new trial (Mr. Plante\u2019s affidavit, at paragraphs 38 and 39). This finding alone is decisive in ruling out the option of holding a new trial. In addition, the Court took into account that recalling all the witnesses to testify again in a second trial would not be proper or proportionate. Since the Court is not ordering a new trial, it will not examine the applicants\u2019 arguments that Mr. Plante\u2019s rights protected by section 7 of the Charter will be violated by holding a new trial.\n[72] During the hearing of the motion, the applicants acknowledged that they had no complaints about the process followed during the trial held in October and November 2017, since it was a fair process. The applicants also agreed that the examinations and cross-examinations conducted during the hearing of the appeals in 2017 were thorough (transcripts, April 28, 2023, at page 23 (lines 17 to 28) and at page 24 (lines 1 to 11)).\n[73] The Court records are therefore complete, which reduces any unfairness: the evidence is in to the satisfaction of the parties (transcripts, November 3, 2017, at page 182, lines 19 to 21 for the applicants, and transcripts, November 7, 2017, at page 178, lines 9 and 10 for the respondent), and the pleadings are closed. Also, the Court has access to the written and audio transcripts of the hearings, which is a factor that will encourage the Court to render judgment on the basis of the records (D\u2019Amico, at paragraphs 55 and 62).\n[74] According to the applicants, the appeals filed by the applicants require that a judge gauge the credibility of the witnesses because this assessment is essential in deciding the issues in dispute in these cases. The new judge who would render judgment on the basis of the records could not assess the witnesses\u2019 body language. It follows that this mode of operation cannot replace the first trial.\n[75] The applicants referred to Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177:\n59. I should note, however, that even if hearings based on written submissions are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice for some purposes, they will not be satisfactory for all purposes. In particular, I am of the view that where a serious issue of credibility is involved, fundamental justice requires that credibility be determined on the basis of an oral hearing. Appellate courts are well aware of the inherent weakness of written transcripts where questions of credibility are at stake and thus are extremely loath to review the findings of tribunals which have had the benefit of hearing the testimony of witnesses in person: see Stein v. The Ship \u201cKathy K\u201d, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, at pp. 806-08, (per Ritchie J.). I find it difficult to conceive of a situation in which compliance with fundamental justice could be achieved by a tribunal making significant findings of credibility solely on the basis of written submissions.\n(Emphasis added)\n[76] These comments from the Supreme Court of Canada were made in 1985 and do not take into account the availability of audio recordings of the hearings, which are available in this case. Although it is preferable for a judge to see a witness, it is well established that the credibility of witnesses is not assessed solely by evaluating the witnesses\u2019 body language. It can be assessed by examining the witness\u2019s oral testimony (Francis v. The Queen, 2007 TCC 323, at paragraph 15; Nichols v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 334, at paragraph 23; D\u2019Amico, at paragraphs 61 and 62).\n[77] In order to assess the credibility of testimony, the Court may, among other things, consider the following:\ni)inconsistencies or weaknesses in this testimony \u2013 for example, whether the testimony changed during the trial or if it diverges from testimony provided by other witness or differs from the documentary evidence;\nii)prior contradictory statements and inconsistencies;\niii)the motives for which the witness might fabricate evidence or mislead the Court;\niv)the overall sense of the evidence: that is, when the Court applies common sense to the testimony, does it suggest that the evidence is impossible or highly improbable?\n[78] Also, the Court adopts the comments made by the Honourable Mr. Justice Stratas in High-Crest:\n[116] Much also depends on the context in which the cases are decided and the nature of the cases themselves. Cases where the liberty of the subject is at stake, such as criminal cases, cases where there is substantial oral evidence and significant credibility issues such that a rerun of the case might be unfair, and cases where the validity of a public administrative decision is in issue may call for more caution when a Chief Justice is considering whether to reassign.\n(Emphasis added)\n[79] The applicants also noted that the presiding judge had said it was difficult and complicated to get through the documentary evidence. They pointed out that asking another judge to understand all the evidence and render judgment on the basis of the records was a perilous exercise that could lead to injustice for the parties. The Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s argument because a careful review of the transcripts will allow the Court to correctly assess the evidence presented at the hearing held in October and November 2017 and to render judgment on this basis.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 1st day of June 2023.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\"\nLafleur J.\nCITATION:\n2023 TCC 79\nDOCKET:\n2015-1917(IT)G, 2015-1921(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSPE VALEUR ASSURABLE INC. & ROBERT PLANTE AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nOttawa, Canada\nDATE OF HEARING:\nApril 28, 2023\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Dominique Lafleur\nDATE OF ORDER:\nJune 1, 2023\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the appellants:\nGabriel Dumais\nFrancis Fortin\nCounsel for the respondent:\nVlad Zolia\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nDeputy Attorney General of Canada\nOttawa, Canada\n",

Introduction\n[1] The Appellant has instituted an appeal under the informal procedure in respect of an assessment made under the Income Tax Act (ITA) by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister), for the 2018 taxation year. By virtue of this assessment, the Minister imposed a penalty of $5,858 under subsection 227(9) ITA upon alleged late remittances of payroll source deductions for the 2018 year in the total amount of $61,084.96.\n[2] Subsection 227(9) ITA reads as follows:\nWithholding taxes\nPenalty\n(9) Subject to subsection 227(9.5), every person who in a calendar year has failed to remit or pay as and when required by this Act or a regulation an amount deducted or withheld as required by this Act or a regulation or an amount of tax that the person is, by section 116 or by a regulation made under subsection 215(4), required to pay is liable to a penalty of\n(a) subject to paragraph (b), if\n(i) [\u2026],\n(ii) the Receiver General receives that amount\n(A) [\u2026],\n(B) [\u2026], or\n(C) [\u2026], or\n(iii) that amount is not paid or remitted on or before the seventh day after it was due, 10% of that amount; or\n(b) where at the time of the failure a penalty under this subsection was payable by the person in respect of an amount that should have been remitted or paid during the year and the failure was made knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, 20% of that amount.\n[3] The penalty imposed in the present case was 10%.\n[4] The decision of the Minister to impose the penalty is essentially the result of a conflict between the parties over the salaries paid by the Appellant to two employees. The Appellant has determined, at the end of 2018, a final remuneration to each employee for the year. After having completed a trust accounts examination of the Appellant\u2019s payroll for that year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) determined a different salary allocation between the two employees, which resulted in a restatement of the Appellant\u2019s remittances of payroll deductions under the ITA and the applicable regulations. The penalty is based on the Appellant\u2019s late remittances.\n[5] The sole shareholder, director and officer of the Appellant is Mr. Allan Sutton. The Appellant operates a real estate business as a licence real estate corporation, as opposed to a personal real estate corporation. Mr. Sutton is a real estate sales agent and is referred to as the primary source of revenue for the Appellant. Mrs. Angela Sutton, Mr. Sutton\u2019s spouse, is also employed by the Appellant. She is a licensed broker acting as the managing broker for the Appellant\u2019s real estate activities. Her status allows the Appellant to qualify as a licence real estate corporation. With Mrs. Sutton, the Appellant can carry on business without depending on a brokerage firm. Mr. Sutton describes this advantage as a higher standard requiring the corporation to keep trust accounts, to do accounting reports, to file annual reports with the provincial Financial Services Authority. Mr. Sutton adds that with a higher standard comes governance at a much higher level.\n[6] Mr. and Mrs. Sutton are the two employees of the Appellant. For many years, the Appellant, through Mr. and Mrs. Sutton\u2019s arrangement, determines at the end of the year the contribution that each made to the Appellant\u2019s success and revenues for the given year. Mr. Sutton testified that Mrs. Sutton is a key addition to the Appellant\u2019s activities and, without her, the Appellant\u2019s success would certainly be different. She allows him to focus on specific aspects of the Appellant\u2019s business while she is responsible for all other tasks. In addition, she assists him on particular mandates in the year. She may also find referrals. For Mr. Sutton, she is an asset for the corporation and deserves a fair recognition.\n[7] For 2018, the Appellant made payroll deductions remittances based on an estimate salary for each employee. At the end of the year, the two employees carried out their review of the year and determined a salary based on their contributions in the business. Prescribed forms and slips for 2018 were filed by the Appellant on that basis. In summary, Mrs. and Mr. Sutton received a total remuneration of $165,000 and $192,000, respectively.\n[8] By notice of assessment dated February 11, 2020, the Minister assessed the Appellant a late balance payroll deductions remittance for 2018 of $1,745 and a 10% corresponding penalty of $124. This assessment was made following the trust accounts examination by the CRA. The CRA determined, inter alia, a different remuneration allocation between the two employees based from amounts deposited in Mrs. and Mr. Sutton\u2019s personal bank accounts of cheques received from the Appellant.\n[9] A second assessment by notice of assessment dated February 11, 2020, was also made in respect of the Appellant\u2019s 2018 payroll remittances strictly to levy a 10% late remittance penalty in the amount of $5,858. This second penalty relates to a reallocation of the monthly payroll remittances by the CRA that the Appellant should have done on the basis of the new remuneration allocation between the two employees. Only this second assessment is under appeal.\n[10] This appeal is to dispose of a penalty. The Respondent acknowledged at the hearing that the Crown bears the onus for the penalty. This means that if the reallocation of remuneration determined by the Respondent is incorrect or, I should say, is not proved by the Respondent, there is no reason to maintain the penalty.\n[11] The Respondent did not call any witness in support of his position. Counsel for the Respondent confirmed that the only basis for the Minister to make this redetermination of remuneration among the two employees is after the sole review of the banking statements of the Appellant, copies of Appellant\u2019s cheques and to whom the cheques were made payable. Based on this sole review, cheques and banking statements confirmed that the total amount for the remuneration for both employees was deposited in Mr. Sutton\u2019s personal bank account, except for a total amount of $12,675 deposited in Mrs. Sutton\u2019s personal bank account.\n[12] The Court did not hear from any CRA\u2019s officers or employees. During the trust accounts examination by the CRA, the Appellant was not called or asked to explain the reasons for supporting the payment option retained by the Appellant, nor Mrs. Sutton, Mr. Sutton or their accountant.\n[13] For the Court, the procedure followed by the CRA to carry out the examination is not the most convincing. The procedure reflects clearly a selective review, which gives the appearance of a partial examination only of the actual context. This is particularly apparent in the absence of any testimony from the CRA to support their position and of any contact during the trust accounts audit with the interested parties. This is rather problematic in a context where the burden lies with the Respondent.\n[14] Mrs. and Mr. Sutton testified at the hearing. The Court considers both being credible. Both showed a knowledge of the Appellant\u2019s business and were able to explain in reasonable terms the considerations surrounding their decision to fix the remuneration paid by the Appellant.\n[15] Mr. Sutton was the first to testify. In summary, the witness did not deny the amounts paid to them by the Appellant. He exposed how they agree on their remuneration and when they do so. He is signing the Appellant\u2019s cheques. The Court understands that this is a relatively small business and given the volatility of the markets, it can be difficult to predict a fair compensation without knowing what has been achieved by each of them until the end of the year. He explained the reasons why his spouse was receiving a small monthly pay payable to her directly and what was the origin of the amount. Mrs. Sutton also confirmed the same reasons for being a monthly fee that she used to charge other real estate firms in consideration of basic brokerage services.\n[16] He did not deny that both remunerations were in fact deposited through his personal bank account in one single cheque that he signs based on the available cash flow of the Appellant from time to time. He did not confirm that the deposit was his alone. He also confirmed that the procedure could have been different and he could have signed two cheques. He did not think that this was determinant as far as they both agree on the procedure and the final allocation they determine at the end of the year. For him, the deposits in one single account and the right to a fair remuneration were distinct and one was certainly not a pledge of the other.\n[17] Mrs. Sutton testified about on her own understanding of her remuneration. She was relatively brief but clear and truthful. The Court did not believe that her role was marginal, but a real employee to whom remuneration is payable in return of a real performance. She testified that her work performance overall could vary over the years, with each year having to assume her responsibilities as a licence broker.\n[18] Mrs. Sutton explained that for her the fact that her remuneration was deposited in her spouse\u2019s personal bank account was not a concern. She was able to benefit from that money. She made it clear that she consented to this arrangement and gave her authorization that the money be deposited in one single account. Her way to explain the situation was that \u201c\u2026 I was constructively receiving money through our account. So, the account would pay for my personal direct bills, visa, and it would also pay for our share expenses.\u201d\n[19] The cross-examination did not allow the Respondent to demolish the positions expressed by both witnesses. However, it is not excluded that Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-7 filed by the Appellant show a certain discrepancy as for the exact determination of the salary paid to each employee. This is due in part to the fact confirmed by Mrs. Sutton about the percentage of common expenses that she supported in 2018. She confirmed that her share of the common expenses was 11%, not 50%. This confirmation might be false or might be correct. For that reason, the allocation as initially determined between the Appellant and the employees would then be incorrect.\n[20] Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, it remains clear for the Court that the remuneration paid to Mrs. Sutton in 2018 exceeded $12,675. The fact that such remuneration has been in part paid to Mrs. Sutton through Mr. Sutton\u2019s bank account does not preclude the position of Mrs. Sutton and the Appellant that she received the remuneration from the Appellant. Considering that the evidence supports that Mrs. Sutton authorized the amounts be directed into Mr. Sutton\u2019s bank account and she still derived benefit from the deposit to that account, and had an unconditional right to be paid the remuneration, constructive receipt applies.\n[21] Constructive receipt, for purposes of the ITA, has two central factors that allow funds to be \u201creceived\u201d by a taxpayer even if they do not directly have it \u201cin their hands\u201d. Under subsection 5(1) ITA income is salary received by a taxpayer in a year. Case law has noted that the word \u201creceive\u201d means to get or to derive benefit from something, therefore to \u201cenjoy its advantages without necessarily having it in one\u2019s hands\u201d [1]. Moreover, an amount of money is deemed received by an employee when it is available to the employee [2]. An example of this was seen in Blenkarn, where the money to pay the taxpayer\u2019s salary in 1960 was available [to the taxpayer] but he voluntarily chose not to be paid until 1961. The taxpayer was considered to have actually received the money because the payment was held to be \u201creceived\u201d as soon as he had an unconditional right to be paid, which was in 1960.\n[22] In Markman [3], this Court stated that when money is paid by an employer to a third party for the benefit of the taxpayer, the payment constitutes constructive receipt in the hands of the taxpayer. Justice Bowman in Belusic [4], noted that for a finding of constructive receipt one, or both, of the following two conditions must be satisfied:\n(1) The appellant would need to have authorized or in any event acquiesced in the payment; or\n(2) Even in the event he had not authorized or acquiesced in the payment, at least he would have had to be under a legal obligation to make the repayment so that the payment\u2026 had the effect of relieving him of that obligation\n[23] Justice Bowman\u2019s factors for finding constructive receipt have been cited in subsequent cases. More recently this Court in Sherman [5], in citing Morin, stated the theory of constructive receipt is that the payee did not receive the amount in question but need only receive a corresponding benefit. These concepts have been echoed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Cheema [6], citing Innovative Installation [7], held that constructive receipt could apply where a person had a contractual right to receive a payment.\n[24] This Court is of the view that the evidence in this appeal supports that constructive receipt applies with respect to Mrs. Sutton\u2019s remuneration received from the Appellant.\n[25] As mentioned above, although this Court cannot confirm the exact remuneration received by Mrs. Sutton, and indirectly by Mr. Sutton, it remains clear that the remuneration used by the CRA to assess the penalty is incorrect.\n[26] In Simard [8], the Federal Court of Appeal provided insight as to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction regarding the imposition, and ruling of, penalties. Simard was an issue of gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) ITA, however, the Federal Court of Appeal used broad language in commenting on the extent to which this Court can interfere with the imposition of penalties. The Court of Appeal stated:\nThe Minister's decision regarding a penalty may be challenged by appeal to the Tax Court of Canada against the assessment levying it, but where the Court finds that the facts give rise to a penalty it can only confirm its application. As the Minister, the Court has no discretion as to the amount of the penalty, nor does it have any regarding interest.\n[27] In Portland [9], Justice Mogan stated:\nThe obligations to withhold are inflexible and the obligations to remit are equally inflexible. The penalty authorized under subsection 227(9) is fixed by statute, and this Court does not have authority to reduce the penalty or cancel it because it is imposed by Parliament. If the conditions are met which permit the penalty to come into play (a late remittance), then the liability is fixed.\n[28] The role of the Court is to determine whether the penalty was either validly imposed or not. There is no other issue under appeal. And adjusting the quantum of a given penalty would be beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. On that basis, it is determined that the evidence in the present case does not support that the conditions to levy the penalty as determined by the Minister have been established. In fact, the remuneration received by the employees and used by the Minister to assess the penalty is incorrect and necessarily result in an erroneous penalty.\n[29] Based on the foregoing, the facts of this appeal do not give rise to the penalty as determined by the Minister. The Court has no authority in respect of a penalty other than to allow (deny the penalty) or dismiss (confirm the penalty) the appeal. Consequently, the appeal is allowed, without costs.\nSigned at Belleville, Ontario, this 8th day of January 2024.\n\u201cJ.M.

Those companies operate their vehicles in both Canada and the United States of America. In its returns for its reporting periods ended between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016, the Appellant claimed input tax credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) in respect of its activities. The Minister of National Revenue denied those ITCs on the basis that all of the Appellant's supplies were exempt supplies. The Appellant appealed that denial.\nZero-Rated Supplies\n[2] This appeal originally came before me in 2020. The primary issue was one of statutory interpretation of paragraph 2(d) of Part IX of Schedule VI of the Excise Tax Act. That paragraph treats a supply made by a financial institution of a financial service that relates to an insurance policy issued by the institution as a zero-rated supply to the extent that it relates to risks that are ordinarily situated outside Canada.\n[3] In my original decision on this appeal (2020 TCC 132), I conducted a textual, contextual and purposive analysis and concluded that paragraph 2(d) treats the supply of an insurance policy as zero-rated to the extent that the objects of the insurance policy (in this case the insured\u2019s trucks) are ordinarily situated outside Canada.\n[4] The Federal Court of Appeal overturned my decision (2023 FCA 211) and referred the appeal back to me.\n[5] The FCA held that paragraph 2(d) treats the supply of an insurance policy as zero-rated to the extent that the policy insures against the risk of a claim arising from an accident or other insurable event that is ordinarily situated outside Canada. More specifically, the FCA concluded that \u201c[t]o the extent that any insurance policy issued by [the Appellant] covered such risks that were ordinarily situated in the United States, the supply of such a policy would be a zero-rated supply.\u201d[1]\n[6] Having determined how paragraph 2(d) should be interpreted, the FCA then instructed that \u201c[t]he next question is to what extent were the policies issued by [the Appellant], policies that related to risks that were usually situated outside Canada. This determination would be based on the chance or likelihood of an accident occurring in the United States and the potential loss arising from such accident.\u201d[2]\n[7] The FCA was clear that that analysis does not involve looking at each insured vehicle individually, but rather at each insurance policy.[3]\nStill Insufficient Evidence\n[8] As I stated at paragraph 73 of my original decision, \u201c[a]ll of the evidence presented at trial was global evidence. I do not have any specific evidence regarding the individual policies in issue\u2026Without this evidence, it is impossible for me to determine whether the supply of any given policy was partly zero-rated. This lack of evidence is a sufficient basis for me to dismiss the appeals and I do so on that basis.\u201d\n[9] My conclusion on this point has not changed. The appeals are dismissed.\nClarification\n[10] The FCA observed that I had noted at paragraph 81 of my reasons that \u201c[t]here was extensive evidence regarding how the Appellant priced its insurance policies.\u201d The FCA sent the appeal back to me on the basis that \u201c[i]n order to determine to what extent [the Appellant\u2019s] insurance policies covered potential claims arising from accidents that usually occur outside Canada, it would be necessary to examine the evidence that the Tax Court Judge did not consider.\u201d[4]\n[11] It appears that my statement at paragraph 81 may have left the FCA with the wrong impression. Having concluded at paragraph 73 of my reasons that I did not have sufficient evidence regarding the individual policies in issue to determine whether the supply of any given policy was zero-rated, I stated at paragraph 74 that, since \u201cthe parties went to a great deal of effort to set out the factual foundation of this appeal and to apply their understandings of the law to those facts\u2026I feel that it is appropriate to provide some guidance as to how I would have applied section 2 had the appropriate evidence been before me.\u201d [emphasis added]\n[12] The paragraphs that followed, including paragraph 81, described factors that I would have considered.\n[13] At paragraph 81, I stated that there was extensive evidence regarding how the Appellant priced its policies. It would evidently have been clearer if I had stated that there was extensive evidence of the methodology that the Appellant used to price its policies but no evidence of how any given policy was priced.\n[14] Had I had evidence of how each of the Appellant\u2019s policies was priced, based on the FCA\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 2(d), I would now most likely be able to determine to what extent each policy was zero-rated. My understanding is that that pricing is based, in part, on the chance or likelihood of an accident occurring in the United States and the potential loss arising from such accident in respect of a given policy. However, without that evidence I have no choice but to, once again, dismiss the Appellant\u2019s appeal.\nThis Amended Reasons for Judgment is issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated January 18, 2024.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

More specifically the Appellant was denied the deduction of non\u2011capital losses of $2,878,871 in 2010 and non-capital losses of $26,196,711, SR&ED expenditures of $23,229,238 and net capital losses of $347,424 in 2011 - all being or relating to the tax attributes acquired by the Appellant from an unrelated party.\n[2] This is another loss\u2013trading case.\nOverview:\n[3] While the factual details can be overwhelming and appropriate relevant facts will be analysed in more detail in the analyses portions of this decision, a more concise view of the transactions in play are useful from the beginning. I will divide them into two parts to essentially reflect the two main parties involved in these transactions. I will also give a more simplistic bird\u2019s eye view of these transactions and the result they achieved that is the subject matter of this appeal.\nThe Seller\n[4] On the one hand, we have two individuals, a Mr. Tonken and Mr. Mathews, who through several corporate entities were in the business of identifying failed corporations through their contacts in the investment community, inserted themselves into their management and used their expertise to effect steps necessary to essentially clean them for acquisition by other viable companies looking to use their public existence to facilitate the raising of capital or to access their tax losses or other attributes.\n[5] In the case at hand, these gentlemen identified Xillix Biotechnologies Corp. (\u201cXillix\u201d), a widely held public company with no ascertainable controlling shareholder or group of shareholders, as a failed medical imaging company that had a large pool of unused non-capital losses and other tax attributes involved here. It had sought protection under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (\u201cCCAA\u201d) of British Columbia and given the opportunity to develop a reorganization plan by the BC Supreme Court to maximize value for its stakeholders.\n[6] Through Cavalon Capital Partners Ltd (\u201cCavalon\u201d) an agreement dated July 9, 2007 was made with Xillix (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) to invest $4.4 million dollars in Xillix by way of convertible debenture, based on paying $0.055 per dollar of its usable tax losses of $84 million, of which $3.6 million was to pay off its creditors remaining after the sale of its other assets satisfied other secured creditors and $800,000 was to be retained as capital to maintain itself as a publicly traded company with its listing on a stock exchange, including paying salaries to the aforementioned gentlemen, until a sale transaction of its attributes was complete.\n[7] In return, Cavalon would be able to convert 94.5% ($4,160,000) of its debenture into 45% of the voting shares and 100% of a newly created class of non\u2011voting shares so as to give it 80% of the equity in Xillix with the balance of the debenture loan remaining turned into a $240,000 non-interest bearing unsecured demand loan. In addition, the officers and directors of Xillix would resign and be replaced by nominees of Cavalon, i.e. the aforementioned gentlemen and their friendly nominees, and the name of the corporation would be changed from Xillix to Biomerge Industries Ltd. (\u201cBiomerge\u201d) and be delisted from the TSX and relisted to the smaller NEX exchange, a subboard of the TSX Venture exchange that did not have a minimum listing requirement. There was no difference in the underlying rights of the voting and newly created non\u2013voting common shares, other than the vote, so both participated equally via dividends and distribution on any wind-up. The parties understood this was to avoid a change in control to preserve the losses of Xillix.\n[8] Another of the gentlemen\u2019s corporations, which had the ability to borrow funds, and in fact did, to allow the loan to Xillix to be made, Nexia Biotechnologies Inc., bought the shares of Cavalon, which had no other assets other than its rights in the agreement with Xillix, and then amalgamated with Cavalon to form Nexia Biotechnologies Ltd. (\u201cNexia\u201d) and became the successor to Cavalon in the Investment Agreement.\n[9] Before completion of the agreement, the CEO of Xillix died and Xillix was placed into Receivership with Mr. Vermette of PWC, who had acted as Monitor beforehand. The remaining officers and directors of Xillix resigned at such time and in order to continue its corporate existence and meet its securities and other regulatory requirements, as well as have someone sign the necessary documents to complete the agreement and restructuring plan, Messrs. Tonken and Mathews agreed to act as directors and officers before completion thus enabling them to complete the plan.\n[10] The Restructuring plan that gave affect to the above agreement was completed on September 24, 2007, after an amendment dated September 7, 2007 requested by Cavalon, that changed the original Restructuring plan approved by the Court to delete the requirement for Xillix to be first placed then removed from bankruptcy and that amended the terms of the non-voting shares so as to delete their convertibility feature into voting shares. The latter was done to ensure de jure control would not be acquired by the issuance of such shares. The Court approved the Restructuring plan as amended and dispensed with the approval of the then existing shareholders of Xillix on the basis they would have received no payout from the plan. The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that the only chance the original shareholders had in obtaining any value for their investment in Xillix was on a sale of its tax attributes via the completion of the Investment Agreement and restructuring contemplated therein. They had no choice and went along.\n[11] Messrs. Tonken and Mathews then proceeded to market Xillix through the investment community as a cleansed entity no longer carrying on business, having its tax attributes and public company existence as its only assets, and having no other debts or obligations other than to Nexia who now held 45% of the voting shares, 100% of the non-voting common shares and 80% of its total equity and the aforementioned demand promissory note for $240,000.00.\n[12] The above transactions are generally described by the parties in their pleadings and argument as the CCAA Plan transactions and I will refer to them as the CCAA transactions or series.\nThe Buyer:\n[13] On the other hand, we have an Income Trust by the name of Total Energy Services Trust (\u201cTotal\u201d), an Alberta mutual fund trust whose units were listed and traded on the TSX, which conducted its businesses of contract drilling services and the manufacture and rental of equipment to the gas and oil exploration and production companies in western Canada through its direct and indirect subsidiaries; mainly Total Energy Services Limited (\u201cTESL\u201d).\n[14] Due to changes in the Act, which proposed to level the playing field between Income Trust structures and Corporations by imposing additional taxes on Income Trusts through what are generally described as the SIFT Rules in the Act, Total decided it would convert to a corporate structure to: remain competitive from a tax perspective and in its ability to raise funds on the market, retain some of its major investors who threatened to sell their interest if there was no corporate conversion, and address concerns that the new rules would restrict growth by limiting its ability to undertake significant acquisitions. This was noted by the CEO of Total, Mr. Halyk but disputed by the Respondent.\n[15] Lo and behold, Total was introduced to Biomerge through the efforts of intervening investment advisors and, after exploring other possibilities, decided Biomerge was exactly the type of entity it would prefer to merge with using the trust unit for shares exchange method provided by the SIFT Rules, it being a clean corporation with no creditors or active business and with the benefit of having been cleaned through the CCAA Court ordered process, not to mention the fact it had valuable tax attributes in the nature of unused losses and deductions.\n[16] Accordingly, Total entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Biomerge pursuant to which a Plan of Arrangement set out the numerous steps to occur on an effective date that would: amend the Deed of Trust of Total to allow its trust units to be transferred to Biomerge, create articles of continuance for Biomerge (from BC to Alberta) that would provide for a new class of common shares (\u201cNew Common Shares\u201d) that would be exchanged for the trust units and a portion of the existing voting common shares of Biomerge, exchange the 29,050,000 outstanding trust units of Total on a one for one basis to 29,050,000 New Common Shares of Biomerge, provide that the total of 248,941,152 existing common voting shares of Biomerge would be exchanged for $702,293 in cash and 56,730 New Common Shares, cash out the existing 435,647,055 non-voting common shares of Biomerge for $1,695,185, deposit with its solicitors in trust, a sum of cash of $1,247,401 equal to Biomerge\u2019s liabilities in return for a demand promissory note , change the name of Biomerge to Total Energy Services Inc. (\u201cNew Total\u201d) and replace the existing officers and directors of Biomerge with the officers and directors of TESL, the earlier referred to subsidiary of Total.\n[17] It should be noted that the total consideration to be paid to the shareholders of Biomerge through a combination of cash and shares of New Total was $3.9 million negotiated by the parties based on paying $0.052 per dollar on the total of non-capital losses and SR&ED expenditures in the Biomerge tax pool.\n[18] The above arrangements and transactions became effective May 20, 2009 after approval of the Total Plan of Arrangement by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta on May 15, 2009 and New Total commenced trading on the TSX after substituting old Total\u2019s listing for New Total. At this time 99.8% of the equity in New Total belonged to the original trust unit holders of Total and only 0.2% to the then shareholders of Biomerge.\n[19] After May 20, 2009, Total (and its sub-trusts) were wound up pursuant to s.88.1(2) of the Act as result of which the assets of Total Trust, mainly its shares in and debenture loan to its subsidiary, TESL, became the assets of New Total.\n[20] On January 1, 2010, New Total and TESL amalgamated into the Appellant, Total Energy Services Inc. so that the tax pools of New Total and TESL became those of the Appellant, including obviously the tax pools that had belonged to Biomerge traced back to Xillix that were denied by the Minister here.\n[21] Total Trust expended approximately $4.8 million inclusive of the $3.9 million consideration to Biomerge shareholders discussed above and the transaction costs to implement the transactions here.\n[22] This group of transactions are referred to by the parties as the Total Arrangement or Total Conversion transactions and I will henceforth refer to them at the Total Conversion transactions or series.\nBird\u2019s Eye View:\n[23] In my view, the above CCAA transactions and Total Conversion transactions reflect a vendor of inactive but existing shell corporations, with tax losses and securities exchange registrations, marketing and selling such attributes on the open market to a willing and unrelated buyer, who ended up acquiring and using such losses against its income from a business totally different from that of the original corporation, almost entirely for the benefit of new shareholders. The role of this Court will be to determine whether any of such transactions which gave rise to the aforesaid result violates the GAAR.\nGAAR\n[24] Section 245 of the Act is the GAAR. Although I will refer to the specific provisions in more detail during this analysis, there is no dispute that it is well established law that three conditions must be me for the GAAR to apply:\n(1) Was there a tax benefit?\n(2) Was there an avoidance transaction or a series of transactions that included an avoidance transaction that resulted in the tax benefit; and,\n(3) Were any of the avoidance transactions abusive?\n[25] In this case, there is no dispute that we are not dealing with a sole transaction but a series of transactions so my reference to the applicable GAAR provisions will reflect that.\n[26] I will address each of the conditions specifically and set out the position of the parties thereon within that analysis.\n(1) Was there a tax benefit? [27] The Appellant concedes in argument that the use of the Biomerge tax attributes in 2010 and 2011 by the Appellant that resulted in the reduction of tax was a tax benefit and the subject matter of the Minister\u2019s reassessment in this appeal.\n[28] While it is clear this first condition has been met, I believe it is important to note that the Respondent describes the tax benefit as \u201cthe preservation, carry\u2011forward and use of the Biomerge Tax Attributes\u201d in paragraph 27 of its written submissions as well as paragraph 11(uu) of the Reply. As the Appellant\u2019s counsel had pointed out in argument, only the use of these attributes can be considered the tax benefit for the purpose of this appeal. The legislative changes made by Parliament in Budget 2022 to amend the definition of \u201ctax benefit\u201d to include the preservation and carry-forward of tax attributes did not form part of the definition of \u201ctax benefit\u201d applicable to this appeal. The applicable definition reads as follows:\n245(1)\u2026a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act\u2026\n[29] Clearly, this definition contemplates that the tax attributes must have been used as confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in the decisions of Wild v. Canada, 2018 FCA 114 at paragraphs 30-39 and Gladwin Realty Corporation v. Canada 2020 FCA 142 at paragraph 47.\n(2) Was there a series of transactions that included avoidance transactions that resulted in the tax benefit? [30] Section 245(3) defines \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d as a transaction that results in a tax benefit, either by itself or as part of a series of transactions \u201cunless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for a bona fide purpose other than to obtain a tax benefit\u201d. [See Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. V Canada 2005 SCC 54 (\u201cCanada Trustco\u201d) at par 22 and Copthorne Holdings Ltd. V Canada 2011 SCC 63 (\u201cCopthorne\u201d) at par 39]\n[31] A \u201ctransaction\u201d is widely defined to include an arrangement or an event in s.245(1) of the Act.\n[32] It is also established law that the burden is on the taxpayer to refute the Minister\u2019s assumption regarding the primary purpose of the series and of each transaction forming part of the series and that only one transaction in the series must be found to be an avoidance transaction in order to satisfy the requirements of s.245(3) [See Copthorne at par 63 and 64].\n[33] It is agreed that the Court must determine: 1. what transactions make up the relevant series of transactions for the purposes of the GAAR analyses and whether the Tax benefit resulted from such series, and 2. whether every transaction within that series was undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit.\nSeries of transactions that resulted in a Tax Benefit\n[34] As set out in Copthorne at par 43, citing OSFC Holdings Ltd. V Canada, 2001 FCA 260 at paragraph 24, the starting point is the common law series where each transaction is preordained to produce the final result.\n[35] At the beginning of this decision, reference is made to two sets of transactions the parties generally refer to as the CCAA transactions and the Total Conversion transactions. The parties generally agree that these each constitute a series of transactions with few minor exceptions; namely that according to the Appellant, some of the transactions in the CCAA transactions should not be included in that series if it becomes part of a larger series under s.248(10) to be discussed herein. There were other Transactions the parties referred to as the \u201cOther Transactions\u201d which are not necessary to set out in detail here as they are not consequential to the determination of this matter.\n[36] There is no dispute that each of the aforesaid series would only be separate Common Law Series and do not form part of one large Common Law Series so there is no need to reference the Appellant\u2019s argument in this respect although its essentially uses similar arguments with respect to the real dispute.\n[37] The real dispute between the parties centers on the issue of whether the two Common Law Series are joined in their entirely or only partially pursuant to Section 248(10) of the Act, which serves to expand a common law series.\n[38] Section 248(10) provides:\nFor the purposes of this Act, where there is reference to a series of transactions or events, the series shall be deemed to include any related transactions or events completed in contemplation of the series.\n[39] The Respondent takes the position that both common law series are joined in their entirety pursuant to Section 248(10) while the Appellant argues only the transactions that preserved the reporting issuer status and eliminated the claims of creditors should be added and not any of the CCAA transactions that involved preserving the Biomerge Tax attributes including any of the Cavalon\/Nexia\u2019s investment and ownership interest in Biomerge (originally Xillix).\n[40] The Appellant\u2019s arguments are two-fold. First, the Appellant argues that since there is no material judicial consideration of the term \u201crelated\u201d as referenced in the phrase \u201crelated transactions or events\u201d that we must use the basic principles of interpretation to find that the term must have meaning and that the dictionary definitions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and Webster\u2019s Dictionary of the English language which define \u201crelated\u201d means that related transactions must mean that only transactions that are connected in some way, or have a relationship to the Total Conversion transactions should be considered related transactions under S.248(10).\n[41] The Appellant\u2019s position seems to be predicated on their submission that the only reason they entered into the deal with Biomerge was to access a cleansed corporation with reporter issuer status. With all due respect, this position totally ignores the overwhelming evidence that the acquisition of Biomerge tax attributes was, at the very least, a significant portion of the Total Conversion series and one of the reasons for the transactions; putting aside for the moment whether it was the primary reason. The Appellant sought out companies with significant losses, based its price on $0.052 per dollar of tax attributes, required a minimum of at least $70 million dollars in such attributes as a condition of closing, undertook due diligence with respect to their availability for use and negotiated with the principals and representatives of Nexia in relation thereto. Accordingly, any transaction within the CCAA transactions that related to the preservation of the Biomerge Tax attributes was extremely relevant using the Appellant\u2019s own rationale. The preservation of Biomerge tax attributes had great relevance to Total.\n[42] Moreover, the Investment Agreement pursuant to which Cavalon (later Nexia) was to inject $4.4 million dollars into Xillix of which $3.6 million was to be used to \u201ccleanse\u201d it by paying off creditors is the same agreement that provided for the ability to convert such debt to shares that took place pursuant to the Restructuring Plan. I fail to see how these transactions are not related.\n[43] Secondly, the Appellant argues that since the Trust Conversion Rules (SIFT) rules were released 9 months after the September 24, 2007 date when the CCAA transactions were completed there was no way for Biomerge to contemplate being involved in a trust conversion or how conversions would be effected. In earlier argument pertaining to delineating the Common Law Series, the Appellant also made reference to the fact that none of Xillix, Cavalon, Nexia or their principals had any knowledge of Total at the time the CCAA transactions were undertaken or completed.\n[44] In Copthorne, at paragraphs 42-54, the SCC analysed in detail the second condition for applying GAAR and clearly provided material judicial consideration of related transactions or events completed in contemplation of the series per 248(10) of the Act. At paragraph 54 the SCC states:\n[54]\u2026 nothing suggests that the related transaction must be completed in contemplation of a subsequent series. The context of the provision is to expand the definition of a series which is an indication against a narrow interpretation.\n[45] In fact, at paragraph 56 the SCC stated that the language of s.248(10) allows either a prospective or retrospective connection of a related transaction to a common law series.\n[46] In determining whether a related transaction was done in contemplation of another series, the SCC in Copthorne, paragraphs 46-47 stated that:\n[46]\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201cThe Court is only required to consider\u201d whether the series was taken into account when the decision was made to undertake the related transaction in the sense it was done \u201cin relation to\u201d or \u201cbecause of\u201d the series.\n[47] Although the \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cin relation to\u201d test does not require a strong nexus, it does require more than a \u201cmere possibility\u201d or a connection with \u201can extreme degree of remoteness\u201d\u2026\u2026 Each case will be decided on its own facts\u2026. In the end, it will be the \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cin relation to\u201d test that will determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether a related transaction was completed in contemplation of a series of transactions.\n[47] In the case at hand, whether looking at it from a prospective or retrospective manner, it is clear that it is only \u201cbecause of\u201d the CCAA transactions in preserving the tax attributes of Biomerge and placing it in inventory for future sale that Total was able to acquire the tax attributes and it is only \u201cbecause of\u201d these transactions and events that Biomerge was able to sell them on the open market.\n[48] Consequently, I find all the CCAA transactions are part of the Total Conversion common law series in their entirety pursuant to s.248(10). Since the Tax Benefit occurred within the Total Conversion series it also occurred within the expanded series.\n(3) Primary Purpose of Avoidance Transactions [49] As earlier indicated, s.245(3) defines an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d as a transaction that results in a tax benefit, either by itself or as part of a series of transactions, \u201cunless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit.\u201d\n[50] The Minister assumed that the transactions between Xillix and Cavalon, including the initial letter agreements, the January 3, 2007 Letter Agreement accepted by Xillix, the Investment Agreement of Cavalon dated July 9, 2007, as amended and the completion of the transactions pursuant to the Restructuring Plan described in the earlier overview of this decision, was to monetize and ultimately sell the tax attributes of Xillix. The evidence overwhelmingly supports this. Reference to the desire to do so is found in the reports of Mr. Vermette, the PWC monitor and then Receiver appointed for Xillix. The affidavits of Mr. Gannon, the CEO of Xillix during the CCAA proceedings before his death speak to Cavalon\u2019s interest in acquiring Xillix\u2019s tax losses and refer to Cavalon as the \u201cTax Purchaser\u201d. The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that Cavalon was in the business of acquiring failed companies and marketing and selling their attributes, including tax attributes.\n[51] Moreover the Restructuring Plan approved steps that were carried to completion that had only a tax purpose, which include:\n(1) Xillix\u2019s articles were amended to create an unlimited number of non\u2011voting shares with the same economic attributes as the voting common shares, in that they both participated equally as to dividends and rights on distributions but were clearly needed to allow Nexia to convert most of its debenture in a manner to avoid obtaining de jure control. As stated earlier, after the debenture conversion, Nexia ended up with 45% of the voting shares, 100% of the non-voting common shares and 80% of the equity interest in Xillix. Mr. Tonken acknowledged the need to avoid a change in control. Clearly, as in the case of Madison Pacific Properties Inc. V Canada 2023 TCC 180 (\u201cMP Properties\u201d), the logical conclusion is that the creation and issuance of these non-voting shares was to avoid Nexia obtaining de jure control and hence preserve the losses.\n(2) At the request of Cavalon, the initial Investment Agreement and Restructuring plan was amended to remove the convertibility feature in the non-voting common shares into common shares to avoid those shares being treated as voting shares under s.256(8) of the Act and thus avoid de jure control. This event had only a tax purpose.\n[52] In analysing the CCAA transactions it is absolutely clear that the entire purpose of most of the transactions therein was to preserve and monetize the Biomerge tax attributes. Practically speaking, what else do you do with an entity that was an empty shell that had ceased carrying on business and no longer even had a place from which to conduct business with no assets other than its tax attributes and reporting issuer status with registration on the NEX exchange, a small subboard of TSX Ventures? The only evidence of the latter was from Mr. Tonken who testified that a clean public company with reporting issuer status and exchange registration would be worth about $250,000. There was no mention of whether the lower status of the NEX exchange would affect this, but it is clear the primary remaining assets were the $75 million plus level of tax attributes at that time.\n[53] I also agree with the Respondent\u2019s argument that the onus was on the Appellant to show the CCAA transactions had primarily a non-tax purpose and it neither pleaded any material facts in this regard nor made any argument to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption in this regard other than to suggest in argument that the primary purpose of the transactions to complete the \u201ccleansing\u201d portion of the CCAA transactions was to eliminate Biomerge\u2019s liabilities and preserve it as an ongoing concern; totally ignored the remaining transactions that I have found to be avoidance transactions, instead focusing only on the Total Conversion transactions.\n[54] While it is not necessary for me to consider whether any of the Total Conversion transactions would be an avoidance transaction due to the requirement that only one of the transactions in the expanded series of transactions had to be primarily for a non-tax purpose, I believe it would be appropriate to address the arguments of the parties in this regard.\n[55] In essence, the Appellant argues that the Total Conversion transactions were undertaken solely to effect the conversion of the Trust to a corporation to avoid the tax consequences of the SIFT rules earlier discussed and that the tax benefit from the Biomerge attributes were just \u201cgravy\u201d as Mr. Halyk testified. Moreover argues the Appellant, the selection of Biomerge as the conversion candidate is a \u201cchoice\u201d not an avoidance transaction, relying on Spruce Credit Union v. the Queen 2012 TCC 357, confirmed by the FCA 2014 FCA 143 [Spruce].\n[56] That case involved the determination by the Tax Court whether a dividend paid by an entity known as STAB to its members, which consisted of all BC credit unions who are required by law to be members and shareholders thereof, for the purpose of putting them in funds to pay an extraordinary assessment issued by the entity known as CUDIC attracted the GAAR. The Minister took the position that the dividend should be re-characterized as a refund of premiums paid and thus be taxable treating the dividend as an abusive avoidance transaction. STAB was the central credit union under BC legislation that is designated the stabilization authority for and required to supervise credit unions in BC. STAB is itself funded by contributions from credit unions as member premiums. CUDIC was the entity that in BC is required to maintain a deposit insurance fund to protect consumers against losses on their deposits funded by assessments against credit unions which occurred here to satisfy the higher fund thresholds resulting from legislative changes.\n[57] The Court decided this single transaction was not an avoidance transaction and had a clear non-tax purpose. Stab was clearly exercising its duty to stabilize it credit union members and whether the amounts to do so were a dividend or refund the amount of its payment would have been the same.\n[58] At paragraphs 91 to 93 of Spruce, Boyle J. stated:\n[91] In this case, the overall transaction of STAB paying dividend amounts to its member credit unions was clearly done for the purpose of putting the member credit unions in funds to pay the CUDIC assessments and reducing STAB\u2019s deposit protection and stabilization funds to the lesser required level following CUDIC\u2019s extraordinary assessment. This is clearly a bona fide non-tax purpose. An \u201coverall non-tax objective of transferring funds from STAB to CUDIC \u201cis admitted by the Respondent.\n[92] Unlike in Copthorne, in this case no step was inserted or undertaken primarily for the purpose of being able to obtain a desired or preferred tax result.\n[93] The act of choosing or deciding between or among alternative available transactions or structures to accomplish a non-tax purpose, based in whole or in part upon differing tax results of each, is not a transaction. Making a decision cannot be an avoidance transaction.\n[59] This was not a series of transaction case as the Respondent has pointed out in argument and in Spruce only the dividend transaction was in issue and no extra steps were involved. Indeed at paragraph 101 of Spruce, the Court stated:\n[101] overall, I am unable to identify any step or transaction undertaken other than for a primary non-tax purpose. This is in contrast with, for example, Copthorne, where the Appellant had to convert its pre-existing parent subsidiary structure to a sister company structure as a preliminary or intervening separate step in order to position itself to obtain the tax benefit sought. In this case there was no such step or transaction done primarily for that purpose.\n[60] The Appellant did not elaborate further on this issue in argument other than to conclude a choice is not a transaction and so the selection of Biomerge itself cannot be an avoidance transaction. Implied in the Appellant\u2019s position is of course, the Duke of Westminster principle and the ability of taxpayers to make business decisions that result in most favourable tax consequences to them and a caution against interfering with commercial decisions. The Appellant however has staged this argument in the context of arguing there was no primarily tax reasons for any of the Total Trust Conversion transactions.\n[61] Here I believe there is ample evidence to justify the Respondent\u2019s position that the primary purpose of the Conversion Transactions, including the choice of Biomerge, were primarily for a tax purpose and that there are steps or transactions undertaken for a primary a tax purpose.\n[62] Indeed at paragraph 60 of the FCA decision in Spruce, the Court specifically stated that the existence of an alternative transaction is a factor that can be considered even though a comparison between transactions accomplishing equivalent results other than tax is not itself sufficient to establish an avoidance transaction, otherwise the existence of alternative transactions with greater tax consequences would render the Duke of Westminster principle meaningless.\n[63] In paragraph 61, the Federal Court of Appeal went on to acknowledge that the \u201cneed to determine the \u2018primary\u2019 purpose implies that multiple purposes can coexist and that both tax and non-tax purposes can be intertwined.\u201d And in paragraph 62, the Court, relying on the Supreme Court decision in Canada Trustco, stated that \u201cwhere there is an avoidance transaction a Tax Court judge must consider and weigh all the evidence to determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that the transaction was not undertaken or arranged primarily for a non\u2011tax purpose.\u201d\n[64] Accordingly, it is clear that simply saying that a choice is not a transaction and thus not an avoidance transaction is simply not always true and will depend on all the evidence to be weighed.\n[65] In the case at hand, I find that there is overwhelming evidence to support the Respondent\u2019s position that the Total Conversion series as a whole and individual transactions within that series were undertaken primarily for tax purposes \u2013 to access the Biomerge tax attributes in a manner that avoided the application of s.111(5) of the Act. Such evidence includes the following:\n(1) Notwithstanding Mr. Halyk\u2019s testimony that all options were considered and analysed before deciding on selecting Biomerge as the conversion candidate, it is clear from the testimony of Mark Kearl, the CFO, that he was instructed only to consider targets with tax loss attributes and only interviewed this type of candidate.\n(2) The notes of Mr. Kearl put in evidence demonstrate the willingness of the Appellant to \u201cwalk\u201d from the deal if there was not a sufficient level of tax attributes that would make it \u201cworth our while\u201d and in fact the Arrangement Agreement was conditional upon there being a minimum of $70 million in such usable tax attributes.\n(3) The $3.9 million price or total consideration to be given to the Biomerge shareholders was calculated on a price of $0.052 per dollar of the non\u2011capital loss and SR&ED deduction tax attributes available only.\n(4) There is overwhelming evidence the Appellant conducted serious due diligence to confirm the existence, quantity and use of the tax attributes, through independent accountants and their own solicitors. The evidence is that the total closing costs of the transaction, excluding the $3.9 million above, including accounting and legal fees was approximately $900,000.00, a significant amount evidencing their focus on the tax attributes. The volume of due diligence evidence focusing on the tax attributes was huge.\n(5) There was no price allocated to Biomerge\u2019s reporting issuer status and public exchange registration which renders the suggestion that the primary purpose of the transaction was to use a cleansed corporation having such status not credible.\n(6) The evidence of Mr. Tonken was that the cost of acquiring a clean corporation with such issuer status was about $250,000. It begs the question why such a conversion candidate was not pursued or why it did not simply incorporate a new corporation as these options would have accomplished their non-tax purpose if that was the primary purpose.\n(7) There was no evidence given by the Appellant as to why they needed to acquire a public corporation with issuer status when Total already possessed issuer status in the larger provinces and substituted its own public listing status for the new entity resulting from the series, (namely the Appellant), rather than that of Biomerge. There was also no evidence of what value or use they made or would have made of any such Biomerge issuer status. Total was already registered on the more valuable TSX while Biomerge was registered on the lower NEX and no evidence was given to suggest it could not have substituted that TSX registration into a new corporation or other target at less cost.\n(8) Although the Appellant\u2019s concerns with respect to the SIFT rules and the choice to convert Total Trust to a corporation were business reasons, there is no evidence of any urgency to do so out of Mr. Halyk\u2019s stated fear that \u201cthe normal growth\u201d guidelines in those rules would hinder growth. There was no evidence of an acquisition or acquisitions in the works or contemplated that could lead to equity issuances of $50 million in any given year or the doubling of its market capitalization from October 1, 2006, the start of the CCAA transactions to 2010, when the Total Conversion transactions were completed. That would have exposed the Appellant to the consequences of the SIFT distribution tax at an earlier stage than 2011. Frankly, if there was any such concern, it begs the question as to why the Appellant would not have simply bought a public shell company or incorporated a new one earlier.\n[66] Although the above should be sufficient to demonstrate the overall avoidance character of the series in question, it should be noted that unlike Spruce Credit relied upon by the Appellant above, there were indeed steps inserted into an otherwise commercial transaction that I agree were avoidance transactions. These include the step to cash out the Biomerge non-voting shares and the partial cash\u2011out of the voting shares which were exchanged for part-cash and shares in New Total which clearly served to eliminate the bulk of the interest held by the original shareholders of Biomerge, including most of the majority interest indirectly held by Tonken and Mathews through Nexia. This was not just an exchange of shares and trust units but a cash out of most of the prior shareholders\u2019 interest in Biomerge such that they only held 0.2% of the equity interest in New Total while the Total unit holders ended up with 99.8%.\n[67] It is clear that concerns about the application of the SIFT Rules in 2011 were secondary to the primary purpose of this Total Conversion series: the buying and selling of tax attributes.\n[68] As earlier mentioned, the sole purpose of the additional step of creating a new class of non-voting shares by Xillix to issue to Nexia, within the expanded series, was to transfer most of the equity interest in Xillix to Nexia in a manner that avoided Nexia acquiring de jure control. Nexia ended up with 80% of the equity in the publically traded Xillix while at the same time acquiring a large block of voting common shares - 45%-in an otherwise large and disparate body of shareholders, none of whom then controlled Xillix.\n[69] I find that the second condition required for GAAR has been satisfied and will now consider the third condition.\nAbusive Tax Avoidance: Whether the transactions giving rise to the tax benefit were abusive.\n[70] As stated in Deans Knight Income Corp v Canada, 2023 SCC 16 (\u201cDeans Knight\u201d) at paragraph 56, relying on Canada Trustco and Copthorne:\n[56] The third step of the GAAR analysis is frequently the most contentious\u2026 Analyzing whether the transactions are abusive involves first, determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provision and, second, determine whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose\u2026 (emphasis mine)\n[71] As set out in Copthorne, at paragraph 72, abusive tax avoidance exists \u201c(1) where the transaction achieves an outcome the statutory provision was intended to prevent; (2) where the transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provision; or (3) where the transaction circumvents the provisions in a manner that frustrates or defeats its object, spirit or purpose\u201d and these are often intertwined.\n[72] The Respondent takes the position that the transactions were an abuse of s.111(5) dealing with non-capital losses, s.111(4) which parallels s.111(5) for net capital losses, s.37(6.1) which effectively parallels s.111(5) with respect to SR&ED deductions as well as an abuse of the SIFT conversion rules in s.85.1(8) and s.88.1(2) which are the provisions particular to the facts of this case.\n[73] The Appellant takes the position that if the Court determined that the relevant series as expanded included the CCAA transactions, then this case is distinguishable from Deans Knight, for reasons I will address later, that result in no abuse of s.111(5), s.111(4) and s.37(6.1) and there was no policy of the Act at the relevant time that restricted the choice of corporations utilized in carrying out the trust conversion under s.85.1(8) nor was there any general policy at the relevant time that restricted the ability to utilize the tax attributes of a conversion candidate under s.85.1(7) and (8) and 88.1(2) and hence no abuse of the SIFT conversion rules.\n[74] I will first address the purported abuse of s.111(5) and parallel provisions and then that of the SIFT conversion rules.\ns.111(5)and parallel provisions\n[75] While I will restrict my analysis to paragraph 111(5) of the Act, the same will apply to the parallel provisions dealing with net capital losses and SR&ED deductions.\n[76] The first step of the abuse analysis requires determining what the object, spirit and purpose of the provision is.\n[77] There is no need to conduct a detailed analysis to determine the object, spirit and purpose ( the \u201cOSP\u201d) of s.111(5) as the SCC explicitly set this out in their recent decision in Deans Knight at paragraph 113:\n[113]\u2026the object, spirit and purpose of s.111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporation\u2019s identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non-capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s.111(5).\n[78] And at paragraph 118, \u201cIn this case, s.111(5) demonstrates Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business.\u201d\n[79] The second step of the abuse analyses requires me to determine whether the result of the transactions frustrates that OSP.\n[80] I have rendered the word \u201cresult\u201d in bold to make a point. The Appellant has essentially argued in oral and written argument that the SCC test in Deans Knight is not only a \u201cresults\u201d test. In analysing the decisions in Deans Knight, The King V MMV Corporate Partners Inc., 2023 FCA 234 (\u201cMMV\u201d) and MP Properties the Appellant essentially argues that the factual analysis to be undertaken by the Court should mainly focus on determining whether the rights and benefits of the original shareholders were affected in such a manner as to result in \u201cthe functional equivalent of de jure control\u201d and concludes this did not happen as a result of the CCAA transactions. The Appellant appears to be elevating only one aspect of the \u201chow\u201d the Court in Deans Knight arrived at its conclusion, using factors that impacted the rights and benefits of the original shareholders, i.e. rendering their majority vote or de jure control meaningless via a contract to essentially shift the reins to different person, to a subtest within the results test. Nevertheless it couches it in terms so as to suggest that we should treat the factors that achieve this functional equivalency of control, or fail to, as the \u201capproach\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d the Court is directed to follow as the factor to focus on.\n[81] Indeed in paragraphs 215 and 216 of its written submissions, the Appellant argues:\n215. The Respondent will attempt to suggest that the Court should simply compare the results of the series of transactions in issue against the underlying rationale of the Loss Streaming Rules to find abusive tax avoidance, relying upon statements in the recent decisions of MMV and MP Properties in support.\n216. Taking the Respondent\u2019s position to its logical conclusion, the Respondent would be asserting that MMV or MP Properties stand for the proposition that the Respondent is not required to establish, as a question of fact before this Court, the existence of the functional equivalent of an acquisition of de jure control or the existence of other hallmarks of control to find an abuse of the Loss Streaming Rules. Such a position is flawed and not supported by a careful review of Deans Knight, MMV and MP Properties. It is also inconsistent with the Respondent\u2019s burden of proof under the abuse portion of the GAAR analyses.\n[82] Deans Knight was clear that the requirement for finding misuse and abuse is a question of fact that requires consideration of the circumstances as a whole to see if they achieved the outcome Parliament sought to prevent [see par 121 and 122]. In paragraph 122 the Court stated that:\n[122]\u2026the abuse analysis is comparative: it asks courts to assess the transactions at issue in light of the provisions rationale to determine whether the results achieved by the transactions frustrates this rationale...\n[83] It follows that all circumstances must be considered in the context of each case. Deans Knight, MVV, and MP Properties all used this approach. There are no circumstances or facts that must be specifically included or ignored and the Court must determine what weight to give each of them and as a whole in deciding whether the results achieved frustrate the rationale of the provision. It follows that an analysis of any control circumstances is not the only analysis that is relevant, and Deans Knight, MVV and MP Properties all considered a multitude of often differing circumstances.\n[84] What is clear from the wording the SCC used in enunciating the rationale of s.111(5), however, is that the focus is to determine the \u201cresults\u201d of the transactions: whether they achieved an outcome Parliament sought to prevent, and so the Appellant is incorrect in its position above suggesting such is flawed.\n[85] Graham J. in MP Properties at paragraphs 145 to 183, analysed asset changes to the target company, the lack of employees, changes in share structure, changes in the business character (including name change), fundamental changes in shareholdings and board of directors, and whether there was a significant shift in control of the target corporation that initially had the subject losses, as well as who controlled the series of transactions to conclude that the series of transactions fundamentally transformed the Appellant and in doing so frustrated the rationale of s.111(4). Deans Knight also considered factors that determined whether the target corporation had been fundamentally transformed and what shareholder rights and benefits had been obtained by the company who affected the series of transactions including the impact of an agreement that restricted the normal rights of shareholders whether specifically or otherwise.\n[86] The analysis the Court will focus on, adopting the approach of Graham J in MP Properties, will be on comparing the results of the series of transactions in this case and not on comparing its series of transactions to the series of transactions in Deans Knight [see par 141], the approach confirmed by the FCA in MVV [see par 144 of MP].\nResults Analysis\nThe series of transactions evidence the following:\n(1) Changed Business Activity\n[87] Xillix was in the business of medical imaging. This business ceased to operate as the assets of this business were sold off to satisfy its creditors, some during receivership as contemplated in the Plan of Restructuring that occurred during the CCAA transactions. No employees remained other than Messrs. Tonken and Matthews who inserted themselves into management and the leased premises where Xillix had conducted its business was also abandoned such that Xillix became an insolvent shell of a company having only its tax attributes and corporate existence as a public corporation that were marketed for sale.\n[88] Once the Total Conversion series was completed, particularly through the amalgamation of TESL, the main operating subsidiary of the Total group, with Biomerge (then New Total) the business of Total was inserted into Biomerge; namely the business of oil drilling services and equipment for the oil exploration industry described earlier; a completely new and different business.\n(2) Change in Assets and Existing Liabilities\n[89] Not only was there a total change from the type of business Biomerge (originally Xillix) had carried on but there was an insertion of valuable assets as well as the existing liabilities of TESL into Biomerge. Only the tax attributes of Biomerge were utilized by the new entity as even its public reporting issuer status on the NEX was not utilized by the new entity which substituted the Total TSX registration into it.\n(3) Changed Name\n[90] The name of the business was changed several times during the series, from Xillix to Biomerge and eventually to the name of the Appellant.\n(4) Change in Share Structure\n[91] The share structure of Xillix was also substantially changed from voting common shares publicly traded to the introduction of non-voting common shares with the same participation in dividends and distribution on wind\u2011up as the original voting shares but which were issued to Nexia pursuant to the conversion of debt to equity under the Debenture described in the CCAA series for the admitted reason of avoiding an acquisition of de jure control by Nexia to preserve the tax attributes of Xillix.\n[92] The share structure changed again when Biomerge, a BC based corporation, filed articles of continuance in Alberta, where a new class of voting shares displaced the previous share structure of Biomerge to set up the reverse takeover by an exchange transaction utilized to convert Total\u2019s trust units to these new shares of Biomerge.\n(5) Change in Ownership\n[93] There was a near total change, no pun intended, in the ownership of Biomerge. Xillix started off as a widely held public corporation that after insolvency and restructuring transactions, including the issuance of non\u2011voting shares, ended up with an ownership structure that saw 80% of its equity interest owned by a new shareholder, Nexia, who acquired 45% of the voting common shares and 100% of the non-voting shares to avoid de jure control acquisition. Frankly, it is quite clear that had the tax benefit been utilized by Nexia at that time the Minister would have applied GAAR then and I am satisfied would have been successful.\n[94] Share ownership of course changed again after the exchange transaction referred to in the Total Conversion series where the Total trust unit holders ended up with 99.8% of the voting common shares and equity in the resulting Appellant\u2019s existence.\n[95] The ownership result above referenced was mostly due to the fact that part of the transactions included all the non-voting common shares of Biomerge held by Nexia being cashed out as well as the cash consideration given to the voting common shareholders of Biomerge which included Nexia resulting in most of the value of such voting shares being cashed out. It should be noted that any voting shareholder of Biomerge holding less than a block of shares of 4,219 shares were cashed out in full as well.\n[96] Since the original shareholders of Xillix owned 55% of the common shares thereof, it appears certain that the equity interest of those original shareholders was about .1% of the Appellant, but of course the evidence is that this interest was cashed out in later steps.\n(6) Use of the Attributes\n[97] The Appellant, as the successor to Xillix, claimed its tax losses and SR&ED deductions in 2010 and 2011 for the benefit of the almost entirely new and unrelated shareholders of the Appellant.\n(7) Shift in Control\n[98] There was a significant shift in control throughout the expanded series. The evidence is that Xillix\u2019s publicly traded shares were held by a wide and disparate group of shareholders such that no one person or group of persons appears to have held de jure control. Xillix had a board of directors and slate of officers who continued in those roles when Xillix sought and was given creditor protection under the Alberta CCAA until the President of Xillix died before it could complete a restructuring, leading to Xillix being placed into Receivership that triggered the resignation of the remaining slate of officers and directors. While the Receiver held the reins of Xillix under the terms of receivership and thus can be argued to have had the temporary functional equivalence of control under those terms which the Appellant seemed to acknowledge in argument, it would be a stretch to find the terms of receivership and the receivers statutory and fiduciary duties as an avoidance transaction although factually speaking it does demonstrate a lack of continuity of Xillix.\n[99] Notwithstanding the fact they stepped into the roles of officers and directors during the receivership, to ensure the agreed plan of restructuring could proceed under the Investment Agreement and to facilitate those transactions as signing authorities, Mr. Tonken and Mathews and their friendly nominees, Mr. Forrester and Kirkham, were entitled to become and became the new directors and officers of Xillix pursuant to the terms of the Investment agreement; which required the old ones to resign and gave Nexia the right to appoint new officers and directors.\n[100] In my view Nexia acquired the necessary level of control, whether one calls it the functional equivalence of control, de facto control or otherwise, in the following ways:\n(i) It had the contractual right to appoint the officers and directors of Xillix pursuant to the Investment Agreement which, together with the Plan of Restructuring, obligated it to sell the remaining assets of Xillix for the benefit of its shareholders. (ii) I do not agree with the Appellant\u2019s position that the Investment Agreement was terminated once the Restructuring plan was completed and the duties of the receiver ended. Xillix, under amended terms of the Agreement and Restructuring plan, avoided bankruptcy and continued as an entity and was bound by the terms thereof to complete a sale to find value for its shareholders. (iii) Although the original shareholders still held 55% of the voting shares in Xillix, later renamed, such that Nexia did not have de jure control, it is clear they had by economic necessity and an unwritten agreement, agreed to allow Nexia to take the reigns of actual control to finish the transactions that would enable them to realize something on their initial investment. As Mr. Tonken testified, they would have got nothing if they did not go along with the Investment Agreement that immersed Messrs. Tonken and Mathews via Nexia into the mix with an injection of funds that paid off remaining creditors and cleansed the corporation for sale of its tax attributes. It is also clear they did go along as the Nexia slate of officers and directors were not at any time removed until the series of transactions were near an end to make way for the nominees of Total. It was Nexia, through the efforts of Tonken and Matthews, who completed the one stated goal of the Restructuring plan, namely, to realize value for the shareholders through the sale of Xillix\u2019s tax attributes that was of economic importance to such shareholders. (iv) The fact that the BC Supreme Court did not require the approval of the original shareholders of Nexia to approve the plan of restructuring is clear evidence those original shareholders had diminished rights by their loss from economic circumstances. [101] Given the above circumstances, there was zero chance the original shareholders of Xillix would exercise any voting rights to remove a board of directors who had a contractual obligation to realize value from the tax attributes as well as a fiduciary one in their legal requirement to act in the best interest of those shareholders. They went along under economic necessity and were rewarded when their interests were cashed out later. As Tonken alluded to in testimony, they had no choice.\n(8) Control of Transactions\n[102] Having regard to my finding that Nexia had the necessary level of control of Xillix from my comments above, it follows that Nexia had complete control of the transactions in its capacity as the Seller of Biomerge tax attributes.\n[103] On the other hand, it is clear to me that Total had complete control of the transactions found in the Total Conversion series as the Buyer of Biomerge tax attributes and, in my opinion, took overall control of the series from Nexia at this point. It is clear that Nexia loaned Xillix $4.4 million dollars pursuant to its convertible Debenture loan earlier reference based $0.55 for each dollar of tax attributes. Nexia and Total negotiated a price of $0.52 per dollar of those available tax attributes and the evidence showed Nexia would be losing money overall. It is also clear Nexia had borrowed funds on the security of its assets to enable it to make the Debenture loan, which borrowed funds bore an 11% interest rate at the time and was anxious to complete the deal with Total to obtain the liquidity to pay off the borrowed funds and get the shares in Nexia released from escrow, a term of the Nexia\u2019s purchase of Cavalon\u2019s shares from Tonken (spouse) and Mathews in which the purchase price was paid by the issuance of Nexia shares to them.\n[104] As mentioned above, most of the value of the shares Nexia owned in Xillix was paid in cash either through the purchase for cancellation of 100% of the non\u2011voting shares or the bulk of the consideration for those voting shares exchanged for cash and shares in New Total. It was a condition of the Nexia\/Total Agreement that Nexia enter into a Support Agreement to vote its shares in support of the Arrangement Agreement all but making it certain that the vote of the security holders of Xillix required to approve the deal with Total, which required a 2\/3 majority vote of the total voting and non-voting shareholders of Biomerge voting together as a single class, would be assured given that Nexia had 80% of such securities and hence could deliver an 80% vote.\n[105] Given the obvious necessity for Nexia to complete this deal and the fact it contracted to deliver the deal to Total, which would result in the Total unit holders ending up with almost all the issued securities in New Total - 99.8%, as well as require the nominees of Nexia to resign as officers and directors of Biomerge, suggests to me Total took over control of the series of transactions once the Arrangement Agreement was entered into.\n[106] The Appellant\u2019s argument that the deal was still not a certainty since it was also conditional upon no more than 5% of the shareholders of either side dissenting, is simply not credible in the circumstances. As I mentioned earlier, the original shareholders of Xillix went along out of economic necessity with the Restructuring plan as their only hope to realize some value for their investment. Nexia clearly committed to supporting the deal. The likelihood that such original shareholders of Biomerge would scuttle their only hope for some sort of payout is not only highly unlikely but would be inconsistent with their conduct to date. In fact, the evidence is that only 1.6% of the non-Nexia shareholders even cast a vote so the Appellant\u2019s concerns were not only extremely remote but did not materialize.\n[107] Moreover, to address the elephant in the room, it is clear to me that Total had the necessary level of control, in any event, upon entering into the Arrangement Agreement with Nexia as such agreement by it own terms severely restricted the rights of Biomerge shareholders. In subparagraphs 3.2(r) and (s) of that agreement, and in other provisions, Biomerge covenanted not to directly or indirectly permit a number of actions normally requiring the approval of directors and shareholders of a corporation such as making any dividend distribution, amending its constating documents, issuing, pledging, or redeeming any of its shares, reorganizing or liquidating, selling or encumbering any of its assets, acquiring any assets or liabilities and so forth; such that the shareholders and directors of Biomerge were prevented from doing essentially anything that would change it to something other than a shell of a company having tax attributes.\n[108] Frankly, in the real world no board of directors or officers of a corporation would risk a finding of gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties to its shareholders by agreeing to place the profitable business and assets of their corporation into hands and control of an insolvent company. Notwithstanding the ethereal arguments the Courts seem to hear in these type of cases, the terms of agreement between such parties ensure that the Buyer retains \u201ccontrol\u201d, regardless of what nomenclature is given to such term - being de jure, de factor, actual, necessary level of or the functional equivalence of control - to achieve the results of acquiring the tax attributes. Nexia and Total here had all the control they needed to complete their respective transactions.\n[109] At this point I would like to address the Appellant\u2019s arguments that suggest this case is distinguishable from Deans Knight because none of the Biomerge shares were purchased or acquired and because the result of new shareholders owning 99.8% of New Total was the result of the permitted exchange method in s.85.1(8) of the Act (one of the two methods Parliament enacted to permit the conversion of Income Trusts to corporations under the SIFT rules) that resulted in the dilution of the original Biomerge equity interest to the 0.2% level. Fair value was given on the exchange.\n[110] In Deans Knight, the reduction in the original shareholders equity interest was diluted only by using the mechanism of an Initial Public Offering. I see no difference in the result. As the SCC determined in expressing the rationale of s.111(5), the results of the transactions are the focus, not the mechanics that achieved them. In any event, as my colleague pointed out in MP Properties at paragraph 142:\n[142]\u2026the series of transactions in Deans Knight is not the only way that loss trading can be abusive. As I mentioned before, each case must be decided on its own facts.\n[111] Here, like in Deans Knight and MP Properties, the only link between Xillix, prior to the series of transactions, and the Appellant after them, were the tax attributes in issue. The impugned transactions resulted in a total transformation of Xillix \u2013a complete lack of the continuity of its identity- while imbuing a new entity with new shareholders to benefit from its tax attributes \u2013 a result completely contrary to spirit, object and purpose of each of s.111(5) in respect of non-capital losses, s.111(4) in respect of net-capital losses and s.37(6.1) in respect of SR&ED deductions. The Minister was therefore correct in denying the Appellant the losses and deductions in issue in this appeal using the GAAR.\n[112] Looking back at the bird\u2019s eye view of the transactions I referenced at the beginning of this decision, the reality of what happened here is that a willing seller in the business of selling tax attributes of failed companies takes the reins of such a company and markets and sells them to a willing unrelated buyer for use against their income. If these are not the type of transactions Parliament sought to stop by the enactment of the loss streaming rules in s.111(5) and parallel provisions, I don\u2019t know what are. The results speak for themselves.\nAbuse of SIFT Rules\n[113] Having regard to my findings above, it is not necessary for me to determine whether there was an abusive avoidance of the SIFT rules but I would like to comment on some of the arguments and issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s arguments.\n[114] I would like to address the argument of the Appellant at paragraph 173 of its written submissions that there is no policy in the SIFT rules \u201cplacing restrictions on the utilization of corporate tax attributes following a SIFT conversion\u201d and at paragraph 177 where the Appellant suggests that while \u201cthere were detailed rules in subsection 111(5) that dealt with the streaming of losses for corporations there were no such rules or evident policy related to the streaming of losses of trusts\u201d. The context of these arguments is that the Appellant assumed only the Trust Conversion series were relevant to this case, which I disagreed with. However, in paragraph 225 of its argument in the context of assuming the CCAA transaction were included in the relevant series, the Appellant suggests there was no abuse of the loss streaming rules since \u201cTotal did not use the share structure of Biomerge that was put in place under Nexia\u2019s investment in Biomerge\u2026 did not purchase Nexia\u2019s shares of Biomerge\u2026 instead exchanged their trust units for shares in Biomerge with s.85.1(8), diluting the interest of the Predecessor Biomerge Shareholders in Biomerge down in a manner reflective of relative fair market value.\u201d; to suggest \u201cthere can be no factual abuse of the Loss Streaming Rules if the purported avoidance transaction undertaken by Total is not used in the manner contemplated\u201d.\n[115] To the extent the Appellant infers that the use of the conversion rules cannot be an avoidance transaction because the use of those rules may not have abused the purpose of those specific rules, he would be incorrect in my view for a few reasons.\n[116] Firstly, this case cannot be properly characterized as a loss streaming of trusts case. The tax benefit was used by the Appellant, a corporation and hence is subject to the corporate loss streaming rules of s.111(5) of the Act and parallel provisions. In any event, the losses in issue here were not losses of the Trust that were streamed, they were of Xillix via Nexia.\n[117] Secondly, the conversion of the Trust to the corporation of New Total pursuant to s.85.1(7) and (8) and s.88.1(2) of the Act, resulted in the corporation owning the shares of TESL hence creating a parent-subsidiary relationship. It was the subsidiary that operated the main businesses of the group and had the profits against which the losses and deductions in issue were later claimed. New Total itself was essentially Biomerge rebadged with new shareholders but no active business or business assets as a result. It was only the next step in the series, that of amalgamating New Total and TESL to create the Appellant, that inserted the new business and substantial business assets, operations and profits into the mix. There is no evidence New Total could have used the tax attributes at the conversion stage. This was a series of transactions as determined by me earlier, not a single trust to corporate conversion transaction under the SIFT rules.\n[118] Thirdly, such a position would ignore the reach and purpose of GAAR itself. The use of a provision as per one or more of its intended purposes does not mean such use could not be considered an avoidance transaction that abused the rationale of another provision like s.111(5); particularly when the rationale of such provision reflects the foundational principles of Act described in detail in Deans Knight [See paras.84-85] to deny trading in losses between unrelated parties.\n[119] The Conversion Transactions forming part of the relevant series of transactions is part of the whole transactions the Court must consider. Even if the actual Conversion Transactions using the SIFT rules exchange method were found not to be avoidance transactions, which I disagree with in this instance, the remaining avoidance transactions are an abuse of s.111(5). As stated earlier, the Court need only find that one of the transactions in the series was an avoidance transaction. Having found an abuse of s.111(5), the fact there may or may not be an abuse of the SIFT rules does not detract from this finding.\n[120] Fourthly, it must be made clear that technical compliance with any provision of the Act does not serve to prohibit a finding of abusive tax avoidance.\n[121] The SCC in Deans Knight, relying on Copthorne, at paragraphs 71 and 72 stated:\n[71]\u2026 the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s.245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules are among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions\u2026\n[72] This Court in Copthorne largely rejected the argument that where Parliament had drafted detailed provisions, then a taxpayer that has technically complied with these provisions cannot frustrate their rationale (paras.108-11). Simply put, specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse. As with any other provision, GAAR ensures that the rationale behind such provision is not frustrated by abusive tax strategies. (emphasis mine).\n[122] Clearly, if technical compliance with specific anti-avoidance rules cannot circumvent the application of GAAR then neither can technical compliance with other provisions.\n[123] Fifthly, and in any event, I disagree with the Appellant\u2019s assertion in paragraph 190 of its written argument, that \u201cthere was no clear and unambiguous policy restricting the use of a candidate\u2019s tax attributes on a SIFT conversion\u201d.\n[124] As the Respondent has pointed out, Parliament\u2019s stated policy in enacting the SIFT rules was to create a level playing field between income trusts and corporations by creating an additional level of tax at the Trust level. The use of s.85.1(7) and (8) and s.88.1(2) results in what is known as the exchange method Parliament sanctioned as one of the two methods to convert an income trust to a corporation on a tax deferred basis to avoid that new tax. More specifically s.85.1(8) effects a tax free rollover of the trust units to a corporation while the subsequent wind-up of the trust into the Corporation under s.88.1(2) effects the transfer of the Trusts assets and tax attributes to the corporation. To suggest it could be used to acquire the tax attributes of an existing corporation as part of a series of transactions containing avoidance transactions would mean that a corporation used as part of a trust conversion would have a tax advantage no other corporation would have if it acquired losses contrary to s.111(5) or parallel provisions and thus frustrate the goal of creating a \u201clevel playing field\u201d described above.\n[125] The Appellant\u2019s argument that since the wording of the above provisions did not prohibit the acquisition of the candidate corporation\u2019s tax attributes and that since s.256(7)(c) of the Act applies to corporations and not to income trusts in deeming acquisition of control to be acquired in a reverse takeover, then the absence of both such prohibiting language and of such a deeming rule in the context of income trusts must mean such an acquisition could not be an abusive transaction. The Appellant points to the fact it is only subsequent to the introduction of the SIFT rules that s.256(7)(c.1) was enacted applying the deeming of acquisition of control in a reverse takeover involving a trust and hence the absence of any such rule existing at the time of these transactions is further evidence it was not intended to be prohibited.\n[126] Frankly, the fact s.111 was not amended to exclude income trust conversion transactions can be equally argued to mean Parliament did not intend to exclude them. Moreover, as mentioned before, s.111(5) and any parallel provisions apply to a \u201ccorporation\u201d thus any conversion candidate would be caught by the clear wording of the provision. It was simply not necessary for Parliament to have addressed this in the SIFT Conversion rules. The fact it enacted s.256(7)(c.1) to apply the deeming rule to trust conversions serves to clarify the policy as well as provide automatic denial of such losses rather than resorting to the GAAR and thus creates greater certainty for taxpayers. Moreover, as the Respondent has pointed out, subsequent amendments to provisions do not mean the rationale of those provisions is changed [see Deans Knight at par 98] and the Supreme Court in Deans Knight had no difficulty in enunciating it\u2019s rationale for s.111(5) without stating any such exception.\n[127] I find no merit to the Appellant\u2019s arguments and would find that the Appellant\u2019s use of the exchange method in the facts of this case also resulted in an abuse of the rationale of the SIFT rules contrary to the GAAR.\nConclusion\n[128] The appeals are dismissed on the basis of the foregoing.\n[129] Costs are awarded to the Respondent. The parties shall have until March 4, 2024 to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the Respondent shall have a until April 4, 2024 to serve and file written submissions on costs and the Appellant shall have 30 days following the service of the Respondent\u2019s submissions above to file and serve a written response. Any such submission shall not exceed 10 pages in length.

Spiro\nAppearances:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nLalitha Ramachandran\nAndrea Jackett\nAMENDED JUDGMENT\nThe Respondent\u2019s motion to extend time to serve the Reply to February 4, 2021 is granted, without costs.\nThe Appellant\u2019s appeal is allowed, without costs. The redeterminations made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) on March 20, 2020, for the periods July 2015 to June 2016; July 2016 to June 2017; July 2017 to June 2018; July 2018 to June 2019; and July 2019 to June 2020 are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and redetermination on the basis that the Appellant is entitled to 50% of the Canada Child Benefit under subsection 122.61(1.1) of the Income Tax Act in respect of the following 45 months as he was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in respect of his two youngest children in those months: February 2016, March 2016, April 2016, May 2016, June 2016, July 2016, August 2016, September 2016, October 2016, November 2016, December 2016, January 2017, February 2017, March 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\nThis Amended Judgment is issued in substitution of the Judgment dated January 31, 2024.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 21st day of June 2024.\n\u201cDavid E. Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 13\nDate: 20240621\nDocket: 2020-1960(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nLUIGI GINO AUDDINO,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nAMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Gino Auddino, claims 50% of the Canada Child Benefit (the \u201cCCB\u201d) as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d from July 2015 to June 2020 under the provisions of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) disallowed the Appellant\u2019s claim by notices of redetermination dated March 20, 2020. The Appellant challenges those redeterminations.\n[2] The Court heard evidence on June 15, 2023 from the Appellant and his former spouse. Because the Appellant was self\u2011represented, and in light of the amount of evidence dealing with various parenting schedules over a period of five years, I asked the parties to submit written argument. The Court received written argument from the parties in July, September, and October 2023.\n[3] The Appellant has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying entitlement to 50% of the CCB as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for the following months: February 2016, March 2016, April 2016, May 2016, June 2016, July 2016, August 2016, September 2016, October 2016, November 2016, December 2016, January 2017, February 2017, March 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\n[4] The Crown made a preliminary motion before the trial opened to extend the time for service of the Reply. For the following reasons, I granted the motion and proceeded to hear the appeal.\nCrown\u2019s Motion to Extend Time to Serve the Reply\n[5] Subsection 6(2) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (Informal Procedure) provides:\n6(2) Within five days after a reply is filed, the Minister of National Revenue shall serve a copy of it by registered mail addressed to the appellant\u2019s address for service of documents.\n[6] The Minister filed the Reply on January 18, 2021. The Minister was, therefore, required to serve the Reply on the Appellant on or before January 25, 2021. The Minister did not serve the Reply until February 4, 2021, some ten days late.\n[7] Before the hearing, the Appellant told Crown counsel that he planned to raise late service of the Reply as a preliminary issue at trial. In response, the Crown filed and served a motion to extend time to serve the Reply. The motion record included an affidavit from Ms. Elli (Yan) Song, a litigation officer at the Toronto Centre Tax Services Office of the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d).\n[8] On January 19, 2021, the Toronto Centre TSO, which drafted the Reply, sent it to the Sudbury Taxation Centre for mailing by registered mail. I do not know what happened at the Sudbury TC as the Crown offered no evidence from anyone who worked there at the time.\n[9] By way of background, the Court originally scheduled the Appellant\u2019s appeal for hearing on April 6, 2023. The Appellant requested, and the Court granted, an adjournment on the basis that he was required to attend a work\u2011related training program shortly before trial. He told the Court that he was concerned that he would not be able to prepare for the hearing in the short period between the end of the course and the commencement of the hearing. The important point for present purposes is that he expressed no concern about late service of the Reply.\n[10] In her cross-examination of the Appellant on the motion, Crown counsel, Ms. Ramachandran, established that the Appellant suffered no prejudice from the Minister\u2019s delay in serving the Reply in early 2021. Indeed, in requesting that I dismiss the Crown\u2019s motion, the Appellant did not allege any prejudice by the late service of the Reply. He simply argued that this was:\n\u2026 a case of [CRA] failing to do their due diligence and in getting the paperwork to me in the required amount of time.[1]\n[11] In the absence of any prejudice to the Appellant, I granted the Crown\u2019s motion to extend the time for service of the Reply to February 4, 2021.\nIssue\n[12] Few tasks are more frustrating than reading a pleading that does not clearly identify the issue. The Reply states that the issue is \u201cwhether the Minister has properly determined the Appellant\u2019s CCB entitlements\u201d from July 2015 to June 2016; July 2016 to June 2017; July 2017 to June 2018; July 2018 to June 2019; and July 2019 to June 2020. The issue was framed too broadly. Here, the real issue (often called the \u201cdeep issue\u201d) is whether the Appellant was a \u201cshared\u2011custody parent\u201d in respect of his two youngest children in each month from July 2015 to June 2020 and, in particular, whether he resided with the children at least 40% of the time in each of those months.[2]\n[13] No other condition for the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to 50% of the CCB for those 60 months was in issue.\nLaw\n[14] The CCB is a tax-free monthly payment to families to assist them financially in raising children under 18 years of age. A separate benefit is payable for each child. Payments occur over twelve months, beginning in July and ending the following year in June. The amount of the CCB is determined based on a parent\u2019s income, the number of children in respect of whom the benefit is claimed and the age of the children. The CCB phases out with increasing income levels, thereby targeting low and middle-income families.\n[15] The Appellant claims that he was an \u201celigible individual\u201d with respect to his youngest children from July 2015 to June 2020 because he and his former spouse were \u201cshared-custody parents\u201d.\n[16] \u201cShared-custody parent\u201d is defined in section 122.6 of the Act as (emphasis added):\n\u2026 an individual who is one of the two parents of the qualified dependant who\n(a) are not at that time cohabitating spouses or common-law partners of each other,\n(b) reside with the qualified dependant either\n(i) at least 40% of the time in the month in which the particular time occurs, or\n(ii) on an approximately equal basis, and\n(c) primarily fulfil the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant when residing with the qualified dependant, as determined in consideration of prescribed factors.\n[17] The only issue in his appeal is whether the Appellant satisfied the 40% test in the definition of \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each month in issue.\nFacts\n[18] The Appellant is a casino table games dealer. Until March 2020, he worked at a casino in Port Perry, Ontario. He then started work at a casino in Pickering, Ontario. His former spouse, Ms. Marianne Csikai, is employed as an executive assistant in the financial industry.\n[19] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai had three children together. The first was born in August 2003, the second was born in May 2006 and the third was born in September 2008. As the oldest child resided exclusively with Ms. Csikai, the two youngest children are the only ones relevant to the Appellant\u2019s claim as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d.\n[20] The Appellant testified that he and Ms. Csikai entered into a separation agreement on October 12, 2017.[3] That agreement provided an access and parenting schedule for the two youngest children.\n[21] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that their youngest children were at school from 8:45 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. and that, during the school year, the exchange of the children would happen at school pick up and drop off.\n[22] Before February 2016, the Appellant\u2019s work schedule did not permit him to host the children overnight.\nThe Various Schedules\n[23] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai presented various schedules during the hearing:\nRegular schedule as provided in the separation agreement;\nHoliday schedule as provided in the separation agreement;\nAppellant\u2019s actual schedule summarizing his evidence of how the schedules operated; and\nMs. Csikai\u2019s calendar summarizing her evidence of how the schedules operated.\nSchedule from February 1, 2016 to April 10, 2017\n[24] The Appellant testified that the regular schedule, as set out in the separation agreement, was in place as of February 1, 2016 when he was able to host the children overnight. The regular schedule, as described by the Appellant, operated on a two-week rotation:\nOn week one, the Appellant would have the children on the weekend from Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday school drop off and from Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off.\nOn week two, the Appellant would have the children from Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[25] The Appellant testified that in addition to the regular schedule, he had access to the children for Christmas, March Break, Thanksgiving, Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, and birthdays. In the separation agreement, this is described as the holiday schedule.\n[26] The Appellant presented an actual schedule, as he described it, which he prepared for the Court based on the actual combined workings of the regular schedule and the holiday schedule as set out in the separation agreement.\n[27] The actual schedule reflects a summary of the Appellant\u2019s evidence on how the schedules in the separation agreement actually operated. For example, to the extent that the regular schedule and the holiday schedule were inconsistent, the separation agreement provided that the holiday schedule would prevail and that is how it actually worked.\n[28] Ms. Csikai\u2019s evidence with respect to this period is generally consistent with the Appellant\u2019s evidence. In the course of her testimony, she presented a calendar that she prepared before trial to reflect the days that the children were with the Appellant.[4] This was her version of the actual schedule. She explained that as of June 2016 the Appellant was with the two youngest children on alternate weekends and at least one day, and sometimes two days, during the week.\n[29] She explained that in November and December 2016 there was no agreed schedule but she elected to follow the Appellant\u2019s preferred schedule. According to Ms. Csikai, at this time, the two youngest children were with the Appellant on alternate weekends and one day, sometimes two days, during the week.\n[30] Finally, she explained that from February 2017 to April 2017 there was no agreed schedule. The Appellant had the two youngest children one or two days during the week and every other weekend, but much would depend on who actually picked up the children at school.\nSchedule from April 10, 2017 to October 11, 2017\n[31] The Appellant testified that the actual schedule remained in place from February 2016 to the date of the hearing. During cross-examination, Crown counsel showed the Appellant an email he had written to Ms. Csikai, which reflected certain modifications to the schedule.[5] That email refreshed the Appellant\u2019s memory that from April 10, 2017 to the date of the separation agreement on October 12, 2017, the parties modified the schedule to allow the two youngest children to stay with the Appellant on alternate weekends and every Wednesday. Ms. Csikai testified that on April 10, 2017, the Appellant agreed to the \u201cevery Wednesday and every other weekend\u201d schedule that she had been seeking. Ms. Csikai testified that this modified schedule applied until the separation agreement came into effect in October 2017.\nSchedule from October 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020\n[32] After signing the separation agreement, both the Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that, for the most part, they followed the regular schedule reflected in the separation agreement. Ms. Csikai testified that there were days on which the Appellant\u2019s schedule did not allow him to pick up the children. On those days, she would pick them up.\n[33] The holiday schedule in the separation agreement was a different story. The days were the same, but the pick-up times were earlier. For Christmas, Ms. Csikai and the Appellant would decide whether the Appellant would have any additional days with the children. They would then communicate their agreed arrangements by way of a shared application called \u201cOur Family Wizard\u201d.\n[34] Ms. Csikai testified that the allocation of additional days over the holidays depended on the Appellant\u2019s work schedule. As an executive assistant, she had a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule while the Appellant did shift work. The Appellant confirmed that, depending on his schedule, they would negotiate the allocation of additional days. Ms. Csikai testified that she would do her best to accommodate the Appellant\u2019s work schedule and that the Appellant would do his best to accommodate hers.\n[35] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai testified that they followed the March Break schedule set out in the separation agreement. For Thanksgiving and Easter, they also followed the regular schedule (the two-week rotation) set out in the separation agreement.\n[36] The Appellant testified that in December 2017 he messaged Ms. Csikai on \u201cOur Family Wizard\u201d and attached his work schedule over the Christmas holidays.[6] He testified that he had the two youngest children for additional days from December 29th to January 1st.[7]\nAnalysis\n[37] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in each month with respect to his two youngest children from July 2015 to June 2020. In particular, the issue is whether the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month.\n[38] In Reynolds v The Queen,[8] Justice Valerie Miller computed the hours that children spent at school in two ways. In the first calculation, she excluded the hours the children spent at school. In the second calculation, she allocated the hours the children spent at school based on who dropped them off and picked them up. The choice of method suggested by the Court in Reynolds strikes me as eminently reasonable in light of the absence of any legislative mandate as to which method must be adopted.\n[39] The Appellant effectively conceded the months before February 2016 because his schedule before that time precluded him from hosting the children overnight. Those months are not in issue.\n[40] At trial, the Crown conceded that the Appellant was a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in the months of July 2018 and August 2018 and the months of July 2019 and August 2019.[9] Those months are no longer in issue.\n[41] I will divide the remaining period starting February 2016 and ending June 2020 into shorter periods based on the evidence provided at the hearing to determine the Appellant\u2019s eligibility for each month in those periods.\nFebruary 1, 2016 to February 28, 2016\n[42] Ms. Csikai testified that on February 10, 2016, the Appellant agreed to a schedule of one day during the week (Wednesday) and alternate weekends to have the children in his care. She testified that this schedule was in place until the end of February 2016.[10]\n[43] The Appellant testified that the schedule before February 2016 was one weekday and alternate weekends, but that schedule did not continue after February 10, 2016.[11]\n[44] The evidence includes a partial and reconstructed calendar of the Appellant\u2019s work schedule in February 2016 as well as a photograph of a calendar which Ms. Csikai kept contemporaneously and which sets out the days the children spent with the Appellant.[12]\n[45] The calendar evidence shows that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children on five weekdays and over two weekends. Exchanges would occur at school pick up and drop off.[13] The Appellant would pick up the children at 3:10 p.m. and drop them off at 8:45 a.m. each day.\n[46] In February 2016, there were 672 hours in the month (28 x 24). The children were in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children in February 2016:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off.\n[47] Under the method that allocates school hours between the parents, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in February 2016. They resided with Ms. Csikai for 408 hours and with the Appellant for 264 hours.\n[48] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in February 2016. They resided with Ms. Csikai for 324 hours and with the Appellant for 222 hours.\n[49] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in February 2016.\nMarch 1, 2016 to April 10, 2017\n[50] The Appellant testified about the schedule that he and Ms. Csikai used from February 2016 to April 10, 2017.[14] Under that schedule, the Appellant had the two youngest children for alternating weekends and one or two days during the week. Ms. Csikai agreed that the Appellant had the two youngest children in his care during this period on alternating weekends and one or two days per week.[15]\n[51] During his testimony, Ms. Csikai refreshed her memory by using images of her calendar pages for April and October 2016, and January to April 2017.[16] These images, including Ms. Csikai\u2019s contemporaneous notations, confirm that the Appellant had the children in his care on alternating weekends and one or two days per week.\n[52] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that in each month with thirty days during this period, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children for six weekdays and two weekends.\n[53] Based on all of the evidence, this is how a typical thirty-day month during this period would look. The \u201cX\u201d indicates the dates on which the Appellant resided with his two youngest children:\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n[54] A typical thirty-day month has 720 hours (30 x 24). The two youngest children would have been in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children each month during this period:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[55] Under the method that allocates school hours between parents, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in a typical thirty-day month. The Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children for 285 hours and with Ms. Csikai for 435 hours.\n[56] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in a typical thirty-day month. The Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children for 240 hours and with Ms. Csikai for 354 hours.\n[57] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month from March 2016 to April 2017.\nApril 10, 2017 to October 11, 2017\n[58] The Appellant and Ms. Csikai gave evidence that from April 10, 2017 to the date of the separation agreement (October 12, 2017) the two youngest children would spend alternate weekends and every Wednesday with the Appellant.[17] A contemporaneous email from the Appellant to Ms. Csikai confirms this fact.[18]\n[59] In the absence of any evidence that the two youngest children spent any additional time with the Appellant during that period, the Appellant has not demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in any month from April 2017 to October 2017.\nOctober 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020\n[60] The separation agreement set out the schedule that applied from October 12, 2017 to June 20, 2020. As noted above, it provided a regular schedule and a holiday schedule that set out the days on which the Appellant would reside with his two youngest children at various times.\n[61] Although both the Appellant and Ms. Csikai took those schedules seriously, the occasional exception was inevitable. For example, if one of the children became ill, the parent who was then available would pick them up from school, regardless of the schedule.[19]\n[62] In a typical thirty-day month during this period, this is how the schedule would work. The \u201cX\u201d marks the days on which the Appellant resided with his two youngest children:[20]\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n[63] To the extent that the regular schedule was inconsistent with the holiday schedule, the latter prevailed. This is how the holiday schedule modified the regular schedule:\nThe children would reside with the Appellant on December 24th from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.;[21]\nThe Appellant and Ms. Csikai would share the March Break equally;[22]\nThe children would reside with Ms. Csikai on Mother\u2019s Day weekend from Saturday at 7 p.m. to Monday morning school drop off even if the children were then residing with the Appellant in accordance with the regular schedule;[23] and\nThe children would reside with the Appellant on Father\u2019s Day weekend from Saturday at 7 p.m. to Monday morning school drop off even if the children were then residing with Ms. Csikai in accordance with the regular schedule.[24]\n[64] During Christmas holidays, the Appellant and Ms. Csikai would negotiate additional days between them, depending on the Appellant\u2019s work schedule.[25]\n[65] A typical thirty-day month has 720 hours (30 x 24). The two youngest children would have been in school for 126 of those hours (21 x 6). I find that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children each month during this period:\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off;\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Thursday morning school drop off;\nFrom Friday afternoon school pick up to Monday morning school drop off; and\nFrom Wednesday afternoon school pick up to Friday morning school drop off.\n[66] Under the method that allocates school hours between the parents, the Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children 39% of the time in a typical thirty-day month during this period. The children would have resided with Ms. Csikai for 435 hours and with the Appellant for 285 hours.\n[67] Under the method that excludes school hours, the Appellant would have resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time in a typical thirty-day month during this period. The children would have resided with Ms. Csikai for 354 hours and with the Appellant for 240 hours.\n[68] Adopting the latter method, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time each month starting on the date of the separation agreement.\nConclusion\n[69] The Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he resided with his two youngest children at least 40% of the time in each of February 2016, March 2016, April 2016, May 2016, June 2016, July 2016, August 2016, September 2016, October 2016, November 2016, December 2016, January 2017, February 2017, March 2017, November 2017, December 2017, January 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, June 2019, July 2019, August 2019, September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019, January 2020, February 2020, March 2020, April 2020 and May 2020.\n[70] I conclude, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed as the Appellant is entitled to 50% of the CCB as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in each of those 45 months.[26]\nAfterword\n[71] The Crown pleaded that the Minister made the following assumption in determining that the Appellant was not a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for his two youngest children at any time between July 2015 and June 2020 (at paragraph 22 of the Reply):\n(e) during the Subject Periods, the Appellant regularly resided with the Children an average of 37.5% of the time;\n[72] The Reply defines the phrase \u201cSubject Periods\u201d as \u201cJuly 2015 to June 2016, July 2016, to June 2017, July 2017 to June 2018, July 2018 to June 2019 and July 2019 to June 2020.\u201d[27] This is a period of 60 months. What the Minister has assumed, then, is that over that five-year period the Appellant regularly resided with his two youngest children \u201can average of 37.5% of the time\u201d.[28]\n[73] This \u201caveraging\u201d assumption finds no support in the Act. The relevant legislation does not allow the Minister to \u201caverage\u201d the time a parent resides with a child over a period of more than one month for purposes of determining whether the parent meets the 40% test in each month. On the contrary, the Act requires the Minister to consider each month separately for purposes of that test. That is made clear by the definition of \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d in section 122.6 of the Act (emphasis added):\n\u2026 an individual who is one of the two parents of the qualified dependant who\n(a) are not at that time cohabitating spouses or common-law partners of each other,\n(b) reside with the qualified dependant either\n(i) at least 40% of the time in the month in which the particular time occurs, or\n(ii) on an approximately equal basis, and\n(c) primarily fulfil the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant when residing with the qualified dependant, as determined in consideration of prescribed factors.\n[74] Not only does the Minister\u2019s \u201caveraging\u201d method for the 40% test find no support in the statute, it leads to absurd results. For example, assume that the Appellant resided with his two youngest children 40% of the time every other month over a period of 60 months. Also assume that he resided with his two youngest children 35% of the time during each of the months in which he did not reside with them at least 40% of the time.\n[75] According to the Act, the Appellant would have satisfied the 40% test for 30 of those months and would qualify as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each of those months. He would not qualify as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for each of the other 30 months as he would have fallen below the 40% threshold for each of those months.\n[76] But according to the Minister\u2019s \u201caveraging\u201d method, the Appellant would not have qualified as a \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d for any month over that 60\u2011month period because he resided with his two youngest children \u201can average of 37.5% of the time\u201d in the words of assumption (e) at paragraph 22 of the Reply. Incorrect methods lead to incorrect results.\n[77] What is the takeaway for the Minister? Simply put, the Minister cannot deny entitlement to a statutory benefit based on a method of computation that finds no support in the words of the statute.[29]\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated January 31, 2024.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 21st day of June 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] The appellant received in her bank account a series of deposits from her husband at a time when he had an outstanding income tax debt. The Minister of National Revenue assessed her for the non-arm\u2019s length transfer on the basis that those monies should have been paid to the Minister.\nII. Issue\n[2] The issue in this appeal is whether the Minister properly assessed the appellant under section 160 of the Income Tax Act for $82,055.08 received by her from her husband between January 6, 2014 and April 29, 2015 (the \u201cTransfer Period\u201d).\n[3] At the commencement of hearing, the appellant\u2019s counsel advised that they continue to dispute $47,750 of the transfers but would concede the remainder, i.e. $34,305.08.\n[4] The appellant says that the $47,750 amount consisted of shareholder loan repayments, so do not meet the section 160 criteria.\nIII. Legislative framework\n[5] Subsection 160(1) says that where a person directly or indirectly transfers property to their spouse (or another non-arm\u2019s length person) for inadequate consideration, they are jointly and severally liable for the lesser of: (i) the fair market value of the property, minus the consideration, and (ii) the transferor\u2019s tax liability up to and including the year of transfer. The transfer may be made by means of a trust or \u201cby any other means whatever\u201d. [1]\n[6] The provision was designed to prevent a tax debtor from avoiding tax collection by transferring property to a non-arm\u2019s length person without sufficient consideration.[2] It also applies regardless of whether either person was aware of any tax liability at the time of transfer.[3]\nIV. Factual background\n[7] The parties filed a partial agreed statement of facts. The appellant did not attend the hearing and her husband Emil Remtulla testified on both their behalves.\n[8] The appellant is the sole shareholder of Chrisalex Corporation. Mr. Remtulla testified that she provided bookkeeping services for Chrisalex\u2019s clients; Chrisalex in turn paid her management fees which he believed to be about $43,500 in each of 2013 and 2014.\n[9] Mr. Remtulla is an accountant by profession and stated that he handled Chrisalex\u2019s banking and prepared its financial statements as well as both the corporation\u2019s and the appellant\u2019s tax returns. He explained that Chrisalex remunerated the appellant by way of applying the management fees to her shareholder loan account and she would draw from that account as needed. He acknowledged that there was no written agreement evidencing this arrangement between Chrisalex and the appellant.\n[10] From about January 2013 to May 2014, Chrisalex issued ten cheques totalling $47,750 payable to Mr. Remtulla. Copies of two cancelled Chrisalex cheques from March and April 2014 show Mr. Remtulla as the payee and the appellant signing on behalf of the corporation.[4] Copies of ten cheque stubs completed by Mr. Remtulla were tendered as evidence of the ten Chrisalex cheques.[5] The stubs do not have Chrisalex\u2019s name or account number on them but the numbers on two of the stubs match the two cancelled cheques. Mr. Remtulla explained that the remaining records with respect to these cheques were destroyed by several floods in the basement storage area of their building.\n[11] The stubs show that the cheques ranged in denomination from $300 to $13,900.[6] Mr. Remtulla stated that these cheques were loans from the appellant to him by way of her shareholder loan account, i.e. she drew down from the Chrisalex management fees in her shareholder loan account to in turn loan the monies to Mr. Remtulla by way of the corporate cheques. He testified that he used the funds to pay expenses for which the appellant was responsible such as condominium fees, mortgage payments, and property taxes. No evidence was tendered to shed further light on the nature of the expenses.\n[12] He stated that he then repaid the loans in full by depositing funds into her Royal Bank account[7] during the Transfer Period. He explained that with six to eight expense transactions per month, it was impractical to create a promissory note for each loan. He stated that he and the appellant had been married for 30 years so they trusted each other to honour their respective obligations without the need for written agreements.\n[13] It was agreed by the parties that during the Transfer Period, Mr. Remtulla\u2019s outstanding tax liability exceeded $82,050.[8]\nV. Analysis and discussion\n[14] Four criteria[9] must be met in order to apply subsection 160(1):\na. The transferor must be liable to pay tax under the Act at the time of the transfer;\nb. There must be a transfer of property;\nc. The transferee must be a person with whom the transferor was not dealing at arm\u2019s length or to an otherwise designated transferee; and\nd. The fair market value of the property transferred must exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee for the property.\n[15] It is the fourth criterion that is in issue here.\n[16] Based on the available evidence, I accept that the ten Chrisalex cheques totalling $47,750 were issued and made payable to Mr. Remtulla. I also accept that during the Transfer Period, he made deposits to the appellant\u2019s bank account which were connected or related to these cheques. However, I am unable to conclude from Mr. Remtulla\u2019s oral testimony and the limited documentary evidence that the cheques were loans to him from the appellant, and that his deposits to her bank account were in turn repayments to her.\n[17] The arrangement involving the appellant\u2019s management fees being applied to her shareholder loan account is plausible, as she is the sole shareholder of Chrisalex. However, there is a distinct lack of documentary evidence to support the appellant\u2019s assertion that the deposits to her bank account were loan repayments from Mr. Remtulla.\n[18] The contention that the appellant directed her corporation to loan monies to her husband to pay her expenses rather than paying them herself or directing her corporation to pay them, is sufficiently atypical that reliable documentary evidence becomes all the more important.\n[19] Without documentary evidence, it would have been helpful to hear the appellant testify on her own behalf as to the arrangement rather than to hear only Mr. Remtulla\u2019s account. Mr. Remtulla appeared to handle most of Chrisalex\u2019s and the appellant\u2019s financial affairs, but it would have increased the plausibility of the arrangement to hear the appellant\u2019s understanding of it in her own words. I draw an adverse inference from her absence that her testimony would not likely have been helpful to the appellant\u2019s case.\nVI. Conclusion\n[20] The appeal is dismissed with costs.\n[21] The parties shall have until April 2, 2024 to reach an agreement as to costs, failing which the respondent shall file written submissions by May 15, 2024 and the appellant shall file a written response by June 17, 2024. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten pages in length. If the parties do not advise the Court that they\nhave reached an agreement and no submissions are received by these dates, then costs shall be awarded to the respondent in accordance with Tariff B.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 1st day of February 2024.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 14\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-1379(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMARITES PACHECO AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nCalgary, Alberta\nDATE OF HEARING:\nDecember 12, 2022\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 1, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nMatthew Clark\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nDaniel Segal\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nMatthew Clark\nFirm:\nClark Tax Law Calgary, Alberta\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Subsection 160(1), Income Tax Act\n[2] Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd, 2018 FCA 166 at paragraph 3; Eyeball Networks Inc v.

Law and analysis 59\nVIII. The Grant Analysis and Conclusions 60\nI. Pr\u00e9cis [1] These are my reasons on a voir dire to determine whether a remedy is available, and if so what remedy is appropriate, in this proceeding in respect of multiple violations of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights in his related criminal proceedings arising out of CRA\u2019s audit of him and his wife[1].\n[2] In the underlying reassessments in issue, Mr. McCartie is presumed by the Crown to have claimed natural person, sovereign citizen type deductions or non\u2011inclusions to not include, or to significantly reduce, the amount of revenue he reported as taxable and subject to GST\/HST. He was reassessed by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) to deny those deductions and to impose gross negligence penalties.\n[3] Mr. McCartie was also charged criminally with false reporting and evasion under the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d) and with evasion under the Excise Tax Act (\u201cETA\u201d) in respect of these claimed deductions or failures to include in income. His wife was also charged under the ITA with evading taxes. Their criminal cases proceeded together in the British Columbia courts. In a lengthy series of rulings, the BC Provincial Court clearly found that the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights had been violated in multiple respects and on multiple occasions. This included their rights under both section 7 and section 8 of the Charter. The BC Court imposed section 24 Charter remedies in respect of these breaches at several stages of the criminal proceedings. Both CRA Criminal Investigations Division and RCMP police were involved in the events giving rise to the breaches of the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights. In the end, the BC Court stayed the criminal charges because it concluded that, in the circumstances, if there were to be a trial, it would not be possible for the McCarties to receive a fair trial as guaranteed by section 11(d) of the Charter.\n[4] The Charter violations found by the BC Court included breaches of sections 7 and 8 in respect of the search of their home and CRA\u2019s unacceptably negligent loss of its notes and records. The BC Court described the breaches as significant and cumulatively very serious.\n[5] The Charter violations found by the BC Court are not being relitigated in this proceeding, and this Court has not been asked to decide if there were events giving rise to other Charter violations. The only Charter issues in this voir dire are whether a section 24 remedy can be imposed by this Court in respect of Mr. McCartie\u2019s tax appeal for the Charter breaches found by the BC Court in respect of which remedies were already granted in that court and, if so what remedy is appropriate in this Court. This includes possible remedies for breaches of section 8 Charter rights that only exist with respect to criminal proceedings.\n[6] For the reasons that follow, I have decided that section 24 of the Charter permits this Court to impose remedies if appropriate in respect of Charter breaches determined by another court in which a remedy is already being, or has been, imposed in respect of that court\u2019s proceedings. I have concluded this could extend, if appropriate, to breaches of Mr. McCartie\u2019s section 7 and section 11 Charter rights which can only be breached in the context of criminal proceedings.\n[7] I have concluded that, in Mr. McCartie\u2019s particular circumstances, certain evidence will not be able to be used by the respondent in this proceeding for certain purposes, whether by way of tendering it in evidence, using it to impeach credibility, referring to it in any manner that is even implicitly suggestive that an adverse inference might be drawn, or otherwise. The excluded evidence is set out below, and includes evidence subsequently obtained by the respondent as a result of having obtained evidence in breach of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. Nor can the respondent use the transcript in this voir dire or these reasons except, as permitted below, with respect to the evidence of the respondent\u2019s witnesses on the substantive issues alone.\n[8] I do not and cannot address at this voir dire stage whether Mr. McCartie\u2019s alleged under-reporting of his income and revenue in the years in question, was done \u201cknowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d permitting the assessment of penalties, or whether it was a misrepresentation permitting reassessments beyond the normal reassessment period. Those issues have to be left until the hearing resumes on the substantive merits.\nII.

Preliminary Matters\n(i) The subpoena of CRA\u2019s Ms. Sundberg. [9] Prior to the hearing, the appellant sought to issue a subpoena for the lead CRA investigator of the McCarties in the years in question, Kathy Sundberg, who testified against them in the BC Court proceedings. Ms. Sundberg had since retired from CRA and the respondent did not want to disclose her address to the appellant. Following a trial management hearing, the respondent agreed it would subpoena Ms. Sundberg and call her as a witness. Attempts to serve Ms. Sundberg were not successful. Based on the multiple process servers\u2019 reports, I concluded prior to the trial date that Ms. Sundberg was very clearly evading service of the Crown\u2019s subpoena. Accordingly, the Court had arrangements in place for the first day of hearing to promptly and effectively address Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to accept service of the subpoena and to attend Court.\n[10] Prior to the first day of the hearing, the parties reached an agreement that Mr. McCartie would not require Ms. Sundberg to testify if certain agreements and concessions were made with respect to her testimony and evidence before the BC Court and that Alan Jones would testify. Mr. Jones was the Team Leader of the CRA Criminal Investigations unit in Vancouver at the relevant times.[2]\n[11] In these circumstances, and for purposes of this proceeding, I will regard Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evidence in the BC Court, and what that court wrote about it, as the most favourable version of events from the respondent\u2019s point of view and Ms. Sundberg\u2019s, as it has not been the subject of further testimony from her or subject to cross-examination in this Court. I will similarly regard what her team leader Mr. Jones testified to in this proceeding regarding Ms. Sundberg as matters Ms. Sundberg would not disagree with as she has herself chose not to testify. Finally, any of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evidence from the BC Court proceedings can be challenged by Mr. McCartie in this proceeding as is specified in the parties\u2019 agreement, subject of course to issue estoppel, abuse of process and\/or similar constraints.\n(ii) Scope of voir dire evidence. [12] This voir dire is to address the issue of what remedy, if any, should be imposed under section 24 of the Charter in respect of the events and concerns giving rise to several breaches by the respondent of Mr. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights.\n[13] Mr. McCartie is a self-represented litigant. In this appeal the onus\/burden of proof is on the respondent with respect to both the statute-barred years and gross negligence penalty issues.\n[14] In the interest of efficiency of the appeal process as a whole, the parties were agreeable to the Crown witnesses on this voir dire also giving their evidence on the merits and substantive issues in these appeals. In this decision on the voir dire addressing the issue of remedies, and having decided the remedy will include restrictions on evidence the Crown may submit on the substantive merits regarding these issues, I also need to identify what portion, if any, of their testimony in the voir dire can be used in the hearing on the merits. On this basis, all of the Crown witnesses in this proceeding have given evidence in chief, been cross-examined, and have answered my questions regarding their evidence. Any further Crown evidence in this proceeding will require leave.\n[15] In the circumstances of this case, I would not allow Mr. McCartie to testify in this voir dire to the merits and substantive issues in his appeals. His evidence was limited to the Charter issues and evidence. It did not appear wise to allow an unrepresented appellant testify on a voir dire and submit to cross-examination on the substantive aspects of his appeal. The efficiency of the trial process should not be allowed to override the interests of justice and fairness. When his hearing resumes on the merits, Mr. McCartie and his other witnesses will testify, be cross-examined and answer the Court\u2019s questions at that time, once Mr. McCartie knows what Crown evidence is excluded.\n[16] I did allow Mr. McCartie to testify on a limited basis to facts pertaining to the substantive merits sufficient to provide me with the context he thought I needed to have before hearing the Crown witnesses.\n[17] This hearing lasted [7] days over a 3 month period. Written submissions from the parties were scheduled and received thereafter. The respondent later made written submissions in respect of the subsequent January 2023 decision of juge Lafleur of this Court in Bellevue F\u00e9lix, 2023 CCI 5, to which the appellant was also given the opportunity to respond after being provided by the Court with the official English translation of juge Lafleur\u2019s decision.\n(iii) Crown concession re 2009 ITA gross-negligence penalty. [18] At the outset of the hearing, the respondent conceded the issue of the assessment of a gross negligence penalty under the ITA for the year 2009. The appeal in respect of that 2009 ITA penalty is allowed.\nIV. The Charter Breaches [19] There are a number of decisions of the BC Court in the years 2013 to 2015 involving the related tax evasion charges against the McCarties. That court found several breaches of the McCarties\u2019 Charter rights under sections 7 and 8. In the end, the BC Court judge stayed the charges against both McCarties in 2015 on the basis that, if he allowed the trial to continue without access to evidence relating to the date that CRA\u2019s predominant purpose became an investigation of a potential crime, both because of CRA having lost most of the notes taken by the auditor who made notes of almost everything, and the failure of other auditors and\/or investigators to make and\/or keep notes, and because of the McCarties\u2019 lack of access to the tax lead that may have given rise to the involvement of CRA Criminal Investigations because its contents and\/or date might disclose the identity of the informer, would be to deny them to a fair trial and fundamental justice contrary to sections 8 and 11 of the Charter.[3]\n[20] The following BC Court decisions and reasons are relevant to this voir dire in Mr. McCartie\u2019s tax appeal. All of these are decisions of Judge Gouge, and the McCarties were self represented at each of these hearings. There were at least four earlier decisions of the BC Court in the McCarties\u2019 proceedings dealing with, among other things, the McCarties\u2019 disclosure request for CRA\u2019s notes and records, the McCarties\u2019 asserting of their rights to fairness in their trial, and the issue of informer privilege.\n(i) McCartie 2013 BCPC 221 (\u201cMcCartie 2013-1\u201d) (3-day voir dire hearing)\n[21] In the immediately preceding McCarties decision by another judge, the BC Court determined that informer privilege applied to \u201cAny information which might give rise to a risk of disclosure of the identity of an informer in this case\u201d and \u201cthe Crown aknowledges that the informer, while confidential, was not anonymous, and the Crown is aware of his or her identity\u201d.\n[22] Before the BC Court, at this hearing after the trial had commenced, was the issue of whether certain evidence gathered by CRA using its audit power should be admissible since it was asserted by the McCarties that it was obtained by compelled disclosure at a time that the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s inquiries was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution which is contrary to R. v. Jarvis [2002] 3 SCR 757. Central to this issue was the foundational need for the McCarties to establish the date on which the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s inquiries changed from audit to potential criminal prosecution which that court referred to, and as defined as, the Key Date.\n[23] The evidence regarding the Key Date depended primarily on oral evidence of CRA employees. The Crown asserted that \u201cmuch of the evidence that would shed light on the Key Date would, if disclosed to Mr. and Ms. McCartie, give rise to a risk of disclosure of the identity of the informer\u201d. The Crown asked Judge Gouge that hear that evidence in camera.\n[24] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the evidence in the trial prior to the commencement of the voir dire he was then deciding included the following.\n[25] Jason Brown audited both McCarties\u2019 2002 and 2003 years in 2004. Mr. Brown submitted his audit report to his supervisor in March 2005. Reassessments of both years were issued to both taxpayers. Both McCarties appealed the reassessments and were \u201csubstantially successful\u201d resulting in \u201csignificant reduction\u201d to their reassessed taxes and the cancellation of penalties assessed. Prior to March 2005 Mr. Brown had no communication with CRA Criminal Investigations relating to the McCarties.\n[26] In March 2005 Mr. Brown prepared the Penalty Recommendation Report. The penalty report stated that Mr. McCartie knowingly claimed specific business expenses that he knew were false having: i) deducted a single expense twice; ii) deducted expenses incurred in Canada while he was not in the country; and iii) deducted amounts that were not even incurred.\n[27] Judge Gouge noted that, read grammatically, each of these three assertions is an allegation of criminal fraud by Mr. McCartie. Mr. Brown, however, denied that he intended to make such allegations. That penalty report was sent, as a matter of routine, to Criminal Investigations. Per Judge Gouge \u201cThat is because, in most cases, the circumstances which will justify the imposition of the penalty under section 163(2) of the ITA raised at least the possibility of criminal misconduct\u201d\n[28] In the next two months (prior to June 2005) the Assistant-Director of Criminal Investigations and one of her Investigators summoned Mr. Brown to a meeting with them to discuss whether there should be a criminal investigation of the McCarties. It was decided that they did not warrant a criminal investigation due to the amounts involved and the available evidence. Mr. Brown flagged the McCarties\u2019 audit files for follow-up in future years.\n[29] Mr. Brown transferred to Criminal Investigations for a period of six to seven months in 2007 and worked as an Investigator throughout that time. He could not recall if he took the McCarties\u2019 audit files with him to Criminal Investigations, whether he could access them electronically, or whether Criminal Investigations could access audit files electronically.\n[30] At the end of his seven months in Criminal Investigations, Mr. Brown returned to his duties in Audit. His reminder system brought the McCarties\u2019 audit files forward for review. He noted Mr. McCartie had made an assignment in bankruptcy and that his annual personal expenses reported to the trustee in bankruptcy could not have been funded from his income reported to CRA.\n[31] Mr. Brown\u2019s supervisor and Team Leader in Audit also testified. His team conducted a series of audits of the McCarties during the periods 2002 to 2007. His audit team prepared and printed on February 11, 2008 documents, a portion of which had been rubberstamped after printing with the words \u201cADDITIONAL INFORMATION - SEE INVESTIGATIONS - DO NOT PLACE SCREEN 1 IN TAXPAYER\u2019S FILE\u201d. That rubberstamp is kept in the office of Criminal Investigations and used by Criminal Investigations. Judge Gouge wrote that \u201cit appears at least likely that the stamp was applied after the Key Date\u201d. When the judge asked his own question of the witness about when such a stamp would be applied to documents generally by Criminal Investigations, the Crown objected on the basis an answer might reveal the date of the informer tip and assist the McCarties to identify the informer. When Judge Gouge did not allow the objection, the Crown asked for an in camera hearing to determine which questions the McCarties or the judge could put to CRA witnesses in relation to the Key Date.\n[32] In his analysis, Judge Gouge described as \u201cwell settled\u201d that the right to make full answer and defense is an aspect of the right to fundamental justice guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter. He continued that one cannot make a full answer to evidence which one has not heard. He noted that this may be limited by other pressing juridical objectives and that the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the need to protect informer confidentiality outweighs the right to fundamental justice. Judge Gouge concluded that an in camera hearing should be held to determine the Key Date, but that another judge of the BC court should preside at the in camera hearing. Judge Gouge also noted that, while the onus to prove a Charter breach on a balance of probabilities normally falls on the party alleging the breach, in this case the Crown may carry that onus as the facts pertaining to the Key Date are within the exclusive knowledge of the Crown.\n(ii) McCartie 2013 BCPC 289 (\u201cMcCartie 2013-2\u201d) (3-day voir dire hearing)\n[33] A judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia had held that Judge Gouge had erred in deciding that another BC Provincial Court judge should preside at an in camera hearing and determine the Key Date. The matter was sent back to Judge Gouge.\n[34] Judge Gouge wrote in his background paragraphs that the McCarties explained that they were unable to afford counsel and had been refused legal aid. He continued \u201cthey are intelligent, articulate, well educated people, but have no legal training. As a result, the complex procedural issues now under discussion are difficult for them to understand\u201d.\n[35] In deciding what procedure would best accommodate to the greatest extent the McCarties\u2019 right to a fair trial and give them a fair opportunity to present their case for exclusion of alleged evidence compelled after the Key Date, given the state\u2019s interest in protecting the identity of a confidential informer, Judge Gouge concluded:\nAn adversarial hearing in which all of the evidence is presented by the Crown, and in which no one is entitled to cross-examine the Crown witnesses, is not a fair hearing;\nAn adversarial hearing in which one party, who may bear the onus of proof, is excluded while the other party presents all of the material evidence would be an \u201cextremely unfair hearing\u201d.\nThat, if Judge Gouge were to ask questions of the Crown witnesses on behalf of the McCarties, but without any ability to get instructions from them or to review all of the Crown disclosure to them, that process would be \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d.[4]\nThere should be no in camera hearing to determine the Key Date in the course of the trial, unless and until the Crown identifies that information relevant to the confidential informer identity is about to be, or may be revealed. At that time, the hearing of the trial would proceed in camera until the judge decides the risk has passed.\nWhile the trial is heard in camera, the judge would ask questions of counsel and witnesses as he thinks appropriate which may include a \u201csearching cross\u2011examination\u201d of a witness, and\nWhile excluded from any witness\u2019 testimony, the McCarties could offer suggestions to the judge, in the presence of the Crown but not the witness, as to areas of evidence he ought to explore with each witness and suggestions for cross-examination by the judge when the in camera testimony of the Court continued.\n[36] Judge Gouge noted that he was not confident his procedure would result in a fair trial and that he could only assess that later in the trial. If he were to conclude the trial was not fair, it would then be necessary for him to decide whether it should be allowed to proceed, despite the unfairness, or whether a stay of proceedings should be ordered by him.\n[37] He further noted that, as the standard of proof in proving the Key Date was a balance of probabilities, and given that determinations to such a standard rarely depend on who bears the onus, it might never be necessary to decide where the onus lies in this case.\n(iii) McCartie 2014 BCPC 128 (\u201cMcCartie 2014\u201d) (19-day voir dire hearing)\n[38] Judge Gouge begins by noting that, at this stage, he is at 19 days of a voir dire hearing since resuming the trial after McCartie 2013-2 had started and that the voir dire is incomplete. He suspended this voir dire after he asked the parties if it should be suspended to allow him to hear and decide an application by the McCarties for a stay of judicial proceeding filed months earlier after McCartie 2013-2. The grounds advanced for the stay were that the McCarties had been denied a fair opportunity to prove their case on the voir dire as a result of CRA\u2019s loss of the notes prepared by Annette Coles, a CRA auditor, during the CRA audit of the McCarties for 2005 to 2007. The parties all agreed that the stay application should be heard at that time. However, after Mr. McCartie made their submissions, and just before the Crown was to make its submissions, the McCarties said that they had reconsidered, that they wanted to finish calling their witnesses in the Jarvis voir dire and defer further consideration of the stay application until that had been completed. Judge Gouge decided that it was not appropriate to continue hearing a stay application until either:\n1)All of the evidence on the Jarvis voir dire had been heard; or\n2)All of the parties agreed that enough evidence had been heard on the Jarvis voir dire to return to hear and decide the stay application.\n[39] Further evidence\/facts in this decision: Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the evidence heard to that date was as follows.\n[40] CRA has separate departments for civil audits and for Criminal Investigations that have separate offices, separate staff and separate files. When an auditor suspects that a criminal offence has been committed, they are required to report their suspicions to their team leader. If the team leader considers it appropriate, the team leader reports the facts to Criminal Investigations, which then decides whether to launch a criminal investigation. If it decides to launch a criminal investigation, Audit hands over its file to Criminal Investigations and ceases to have any role with the case.\n[41] The evidence of CRA\u2019s note-taking policies was from two auditors involved with the McCarties\u2019 audits\u2014Ms. Coles mentioned above, and David McLachlin, who took over the audits from Ms. Coles (and who also testified in the voir dire I am now deciding). The evidence of these two auditors diverged on this topic. Judge Gouge summarized Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence; it included:\n[12] Two CRA auditors, Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan, gave divergent evidence about CRA\u2019s note-taking and note retention policies. Ms. Coles said that:\na. She took handwritten notes during all meetings of significance, whether with the taxpayer, with other CRA employees or with external sources of information.\nb. Upon her return to her office, she would transpose those notes onto CRA Form T-2020.\nc. In many cases, her notes on Form T-2020 were more extensive than her handwritten notes because she would supplement her handwritten notes with her memory of the meeting.\nd. Form #T-2020 is used to record notes of: (i) substantive information received; (ii) significant oral communications; and (iii) decisions relevant to the audit, which are not otherwise recorded in writing. So, for example, all oral communications with the individuals who are the subject of the audit are recorded on Form #T-2020, but correspondence with those individuals is not because hard copies of the correspondence are maintained in the correspondence file.\ne. As she understood CRA\u2019s policies, she was required to make notes on Form T-2020 whenever she discussed an audit with her team leader or with any employee of the Investigations Department. Those notes would include summaries of the matters discussed, of any decisions taken and of the reasons for the decisions.\nf. Form T-2020 notes were stored on CRA\u2019s computer system.\n[13] Mr. McLachlan said that he would make a note on Form T-2020 whenever he met with his team leader, but that the note would not necessarily record what was said at the meeting - it might simply record that a meeting occurred. Similarly, if he met with staff of the Investigations Department, and the Investigations Department decided not to launch a criminal investigation, he would note the existence, but not necessarily the substance, of the discussion, on Form T-2020. He said that, if the Investigations Department decided to launch a criminal investigation, he would hand over his files (paper and electronic) to the Investigations Department, and would not thereafter have access to the file, with the result that he could not make any further notes on Form T-2020.\n[14] The evidence includes some examples of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s T-2020 notes on the McCartie file. They are consistent with his oral evidence of his note-taking practice; i.e. they provide few or no details of the matters discussed on the occasions which are the subject of the notes.\n[42] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence included:\n[18] Shortly after issuing his notice of reassessment [for the earlier years 2002-2003 in 2005], Mr. Brown was approached by Ms. Karen Etches and Mr. Greg Chan. Ms. Etches was then the Assistant Director of the Investigations Department and Mr. Chan was an investigator who worked under her supervision. Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan met. Mr. Brown described the meeting in the following terms:\n\u2026 they were asking me questions about possibly conducting an investigation, and I told them that this is mostly just personal expenses, and I don\u2019t think that this would warrant a \u2026 full-on investigation. I just felt that it was just a --- that they [Ms. & Mr. McCartie] were just negligent.\nMr. Brown said that, at the conclusion of the meeting, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan expressed a lack of interest in pursuing a criminal investigation of Mr. & Ms. McCartie.\n[19] Mr. Preshaw [respondent counsel] informed me that Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan have no notes of the meeting, and profess to have no recollection of it.\n[20] Mr. Brown denied that he suspected Mr. or Ms. McCartie of fraud or tax evasion. However, three passages in his report to his team leader, Mr. Gordon Lidster, cast some doubt on the assertion.\na. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nThe taxpayers\u2019 records were inadequate for income tax purposes. Furthermore, some of the expense receipts were not even incurred by the taxpayer.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr. Brown characterized that statement as an assumption, rather than an assertion. The document does not support that characterization.\nb. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlong with the egregious amounts of personal expenses being deducted, there were many other problems with the records. Some of the cash expenses were already recorded.\nIn answer to Mr. McCartie\u2019s question during cross-examination, Mr. Brown confirmed that this passage was intended to convey Mr. Brown\u2019s suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie had double-reported, or claimed twice, certain expenses.\nc. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlso, the taxpayer deducted two receipts from the same restaurant bill.\nIn his oral evidence on the Jarvis voir dire, Mr. Brown denied that he intended any of those assertions to be an allegation of criminal fraud.\n[21] Mr. Brown was transferred from the Audit Department to the Investigations Department for a period of about 6 months in mid-2007.\n[22] In November, 2007, Mr. Brown completed and submitted a document, on CRA Form T-133, entitled \u201cTax Lead or Project Information\u201d, the purpose of which was to recommend a further audit of Ms. & Mr. McCartie, in relation to their tax returns for the years 2005 - 2006. In that document, Mr. Brown said:\nGeodiscovery Interactive Inc is owned by Annie McCartie although day-to-day operations are performed by Annie\u2019s spouse, Colin.\nAnnie and Colin reported a total income of $28,035 from April 1005 to December 31, 2006. However, according to income and expense statements provided to trustee, they have personal expenditures of between $4000 and $5000 per month, or between $84,000 and $105,000 from April, 2005 to December 31, 2006.\nThe only known source of revenue is Annie\u2019s company, Geodiscovery Interactive Inc in 2006. Geodiscovery reported $145,000 in subcontracts on gross sales of $165,000, and no T4A\u2019s issued. Was this $145,000 paid to Colin? Between Colin and Annie, they only reported gross income of $1635 in 2006.\nColin and Annie were previously audited and reassessed for a large amount of expenses that were deducted.[5] In 2004, Colin declared bankruptcy and was absolved of his tax debt.\nIn June, 2007 (outside audit period) the McCarties sold their house for $365,000 and purchased a new house for $540,000. Where\u2019s all this money coming from?\nPossible net worth.\n[23] At the conclusion of Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence, I was left in some doubt about the reliability of his evidence. I found it difficult to reconcile his assertion that he did not suspect Mr. & Ms. McCartie of tax evasion with the documents quoted in paragraphs 20 and 22. That, in turn, led me to doubt his assertion that Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan disclaimed any interest in a criminal investigation.\n[24] Mr. Brown was asked no questions about notes, note-taking or Form T-2020. Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that they asked no questions on that subject because Mr. Brown\u2019s T-2020 notes were not disclosed to them until after Mr. Brown had given his evidence and been excused. I asked him no questions about note-taking because I first learned about Form T-2020 from Ms. Coles, who gave evidence after Mr. Brown. If Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence of CRA\u2019s note-taking policies is correct, Mr. Brown ought to have made detailed notes, in Form T-2020, of his meeting with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan. Some of his T-2020 notes have since been disclosed by the Crown and tendered in evidence. However, the notes disclosed do not include notes from the period after he issued his notice of re-assessment, and so do not span the period in which he met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, and later with Ms. Coles. No notes of those meetings have been disclosed.\n(Emphasis added)\n[43] Mr. Brown\u2019s T-133 Tax Lead was first assigned to auditor Ian Chabot. After making a request to the McCarties for documents related to 2005 to 2007, Mr. Chabot fell ill which is when Ms. Coles became the auditor for the McCarties. Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Ms. Coles evidence included:\n[26] Mr. Chabot fell ill later that summer, and Ms. Annette Coles, another CRA auditor, was assigned to replace him on August 14, 2008. Ms. Coles does not recall whether she met with Mr. Chabot when she assumed conduct of the file. She agrees that, in the normal course, she would meet with the preceding auditor on assuming conduct of an audit, so as to be briefed about what had been done and what remained to be done to complete the audit assignment. However, she believes that she may not have done so in this case because Mr. Chabot was unwell. She is simply uncertain about whether the meeting occurred or not.\n[27] Ms. Coles said that, if she had met with Mr. Chabot, she would have entered her notes of the meeting on Form T-2020.\n[28] Ms. Coles met with Mr. Brown at an early stage of her audit of the McCartie file. She said that she would have made detailed notes of that meeting on Form T-2020.\n[29] At some point in the chronology, CRA received an informer tip in relation to Mr. & Ms. McCartie.[6] Such tips are routed to the Investigations Department. Sometimes, such tips are referred by the Investigations Department to the Audit Department. That was done in relation to Ms. & Mr. McCartie. When first assigned to the file, Ms. Coles attended at the office of the Investigations Department and reviewed the informer tip. She said that she did not discuss the tip with anyone in the Investigations Department, and that she had no other communication with the Investigations Department (in relation to Ms. or Mr. McCartie) until after the McCartie file had been formally referred to the Investigations Department by Mr. McLachlan (see paragraph 43, below).\n[30] On August 25, 2008, Mr. McCartie sent a letter, entitled \u201cNotice of Facts\u201d, to Ms. Coles. Although the document is confusing, it would be reasonable for the reader to infer from it that Mr. McCartie espoused the theory that \u201cnatural persons\u201d (however defined) are not liable to pay income tax. That theory is promoted by a number of people to whom CRA employees commonly refer as \u201ctax protesters\u201d. Ms. Coles said that: (i) after she read the letter, she probably reviewed it with her team leader, Mr. Lidster, at a meeting; and (ii) they both probably concluded that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were tax protesters. If the meeting occurred, she would have recorded the fact of the meeting, the substance of the discussion, and the conclusion reached in a T-2020 note. However, she does not recall the meeting.\n[31] I pause for a necessary digression. The \u201cnatural person\u201d theory is complete nonsense. It has no basis in law. It is not even remotely arguable. It is important to make that clear because some people have been persuaded by it that they are not liable to pay tax, and have suffered as a result.\n[32] Ms. Coles, accompanied by another CRA auditor, Mr. Lecznar, met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie in November, 2008. At the meeting, Mr. & Ms. McCartie provided copies of some of the documents which Ms. Coles wanted to see. Among those were some cancelled cheques with the names of the payees blanked out. Mr. & Ms. McCartie declined to provide the names of the payees or unredacted copies of the cheques. Mr. Lecznar and Ms. Coles each took handwritten notes at the meeting. After the meeting, Mr. Lecznar gave his notes to Ms. Coles and Ms. Coles used them, along with her own, to prepare her T-2020 notes of the meeting. She put the handwritten notes in the file.\n[33] In December, 2008, Ms. Coles met with Mr. Lidster. They decided to exercise CRA\u2019s statutory power to issue notices to certain financial institutions to require those institutions to provide copies of financial records pertaining to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Among the documents sought were unredacted copies of the cheques produced by Mr. & Ms. McCartie at their meeting with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar. Ms. Coles said that she would have made T-2020 notes of her meeting with Mr. Lidster, recording the decision to issue notices to the financial institutions and the reasons for that decision.\n[34] Ms. Coles was transferred to other duties early in 2009. As a result, it was necessary for another auditor to be assigned to the McCartie file. Mr. McLachlan was chosen for that assignment. Because Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan belonged to different teams, a meeting or discussion between the two team leaders was necessary to effect the transfer. If Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence about CRA\u2019 record-keeping policies is correct, there ought to have been a T-2020 note of that communication. No such note has been produced.\n[35] Ms. Coles believes that she met with Mr. McLachlan in or about April, 2009 to acquaint him with the file. She has little recollection of the meeting. She believes that she told him of her suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were tax protesters. She gave Mr. McLachlan her file, including all handwritten and typed notes and all of her T-2020 notes (in electronic form). She did not make a T-2020 note of her meeting with Mr. McLachlan - she expected that he would do that.\n[36] Ms. Coles said that, when she transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan:\na. She had received responses from some, but not all, of the financial institutions.\nb. The audit was incomplete.\nc. She thought that Mr. & Ms. McCartie might have underreported gross business revenues, but, in her view, that did not necessarily mean that they had underreported net income or evaded tax, because she did not know what business expenses had been incurred to generate those business revenues.\nd. She saw no need to refer the file to the Investigations Department.\n[37] After the initiation of this prosecution, Ms. Coles was asked to produce her notes, including her T-2020 notes. She has looked for them, but cannot find them. The last time she saw them was when she handed the file to Mr. McLachlan. As noted below, the evidence provides very little information about how the notes came to be lost. Mr. Preshaw says that the answer to that question may never be known.\n[44] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s evidence included:\n[38] Mr. McLachlan\u2019s team leader, then Mr. Rick Gill, asked him to take on the McCartie audit. Mr. McLachlan does not recall whether he met with Mr. Lidster. He recalls meeting with Ms. Coles, but does not recall what occurred or was discussed at the meeting. He does not recall whether he made notes of the meeting. It was not his view that he was expected or required to make T-2020 notes of the meeting. He recalls that he subsequently met with his team leaders (initially Mr. Gill and latterly Ms. Sally Biggar), but does not recall how many times he met with them about the McCartie audit, nor what was discussed on each occasion. He did not make T-2020 notes of those meetings.\n[39] Mr. McLachlan was busy with other matters, and so unable to give attention to the McCartie audit for some months after receiving the file from Ms. Coles. He thinks that he began work on the file in June, 2009. The only information which he received was: (i) that contained in Ms. Coles\u2019 file; (ii) responses received from financial institutions during the period April - September, 2009 in response to the requests sent out by Ms. Coles in December, 2008. From that material, he concluded that there were \u201cvast discrepancies\u201d between the income reported by Mr. & Ms. McCartie for the years in question and the information provided by the financial institutions.\n[40] Mr. McLachlan had no communication with Mr. or Ms. McCartie on any matter of substance, asked them for no information and received none from them.\n[41] On March 2, 2010, Mr. McLachlan prepared a \u201cPenalty Recommendation Report\u201d, recommending the imposition of a penalty on Mr. McCartie under section 163(2) of the Income Tax Act. In the Penalty Recommendation Report, Mr. McLachlan said (bold print in the original document):\n[Mr. McCartie] is claiming that he is a \u201cNatural Person\u201d and has failed to report any income from his personal business operations. He has failed to report net business income of $404,458.39 for the period 2005-01-01 to 2007-12-31.\n\u2026\n[Mr. McCartie] failed to provide any documents for his personal business operations. He did provide some information for his wife\u2019s corporation (operating as CGM Multimedia). [Mr. McCartie] provided information from the corporation blackened all references to Mr. McCartie and to his bank account information. Mr. McCartie\u2019s name was blackened from the cheques and his endorsement was blackened from the back of the cheques. All references to his name on the invoices he issued to the corporation were also blackened out.\nBank requirements were issued to determine the business operations of [Mr. McCartie] and confirmed the recipients of the funds.\nIt is instructive to compare Mr. McLachlan\u2019s conclusions, as expressed in the Penalty Recommendation Report, with those of Ms. Coles, as noted in paragraph 36, above. Essentially, the two auditors were working from the same information. Mr. McLachlan had a complete set of responses from the financial institutions, but there was no suggestion in the evidence that those records were different in kind from the partial responses received by Ms. Coles before April, 2009, or that the additional responses received after April provided the missing information about Mr. McCartie\u2019s business expenses. As noted below, Mr. McLaclan was prepared to recommend a criminal investigation on the basis of the information he had. Ms. Coles said that she was not.\n[42] Mr. McLachlan reviewed the Penalty Recommendation Report with his team leader, Ms. Sally Biggar, on March 4, 2010. Ms. Biggar approved the report on that day.\n[43] Once a Penalty Recommendation Report is approved, a copy is sent to the Investigations Department as a matter of routine. That was done in this case. On March 4, 2010, Ms. Biggar signed a document entitled \u201cReferral to Enforcement Division\u201d, in which the following allegation was made (bold print in the original document):\nThe taxpayers have failed to report over $525,000.00 in Income Tax revenue and almost $30,000 in GST. Colin McCartie has been claiming that he is a Natural Person and has failed to report any of the income he received from 2005 to 2007.\n[44] Sometime after March 4, 2010, staff of the Investigations Department came to Mr. McLachlan\u2019s office with a search warrant and seized his file. That seemed to him to be an unusual procedure. In the ordinary case, if a file was to be referred to the Investigations Department, the file would simply be handed over without a warrant.\n[45] The McCarties asked Judge Gouge to compel a number of CRA witnesses to testify in the Jarvis voir dire along with one Justice lawyer. The CRA witnesses requested were those involved in CRA\u2019s Project Fable, a Canada-wide program of targeted prosecutions of Canadians CRA believed to be tax protesters. They could provide evidence whether, and if so when, the McCarties became targets of Project Fable. The Justice lawyer was requested to provide evidence regarding a letter he sent to the McCarties in 2013 about the lost audit notes (including the ones Ms. Coles knew she had written). The Justice lawyer wrote \u201cWe understand that T2020 notes are ordinarily kept during the course of an audit. We have made inquiries in this regard. Unfortunately, we understand that due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases, the T2020 entries were not retained in this matter. We understand that you have all available T-2020 Notes\/Memo for File notes that have been retained\u201d.\n(iv) McCartie 2015 BCPC 066 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-1\u201d) (2-day voir dire hearing)[7]\n[46] In his opening summary of the \u201clong and complex procedure history\u201d of the prosecution of the McCarties, J. Gouge included that Crown counsel had informed the Court that the evidence obtained by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers from the McCarties\u2019 banks \u201cis crucial to the Crown case\u201d. Judge Gouge\u2019s full summary is attached to these reasons as Appendix A. This hearing addressed Ms. Coles missing audit notes (the \u201cColes Notes\u201d) in the context of the request to have the previous Justice lawyer testify regarding his letter to the McCarties that the Coles Notes were not retained following, and as a result of, a digitisation conversion of records by CRA.\n[47] Judge Gouge wrote:\n[4] Ms. Coles said that she had been instructed by her superiors to make notes, in every audit, of the substance of all meetings with her team leaders and with representatives of the Investigations Department, and to record in those notes the substance of the discussion and of any decisions or conclusions reached at the meeting. She understood that the preparation and retention of those notes was one of the duties of her employment. Notes of that kind are admissible in evidence pursuant to section 26 of the Canada Evidence Act RSC 1985, c C-5, which provides:\n\u2026\n[5] Ms. Coles acknowledged that her recollection of her meetings with other CRA employees was vague. Her notes may have contained a record of comments made by other CRA employees respecting suspicion of tax evasion on the part of Mr. or Ms. McCartie or the intentions of those other CRA employees respecting prosecution for such an offence. Of course, one could not say that with confidence without first seeing the notes. I observe that, at common law, an out-of-court statement by a person of that person\u2019s motivation or intention is admissible as evidence of that person\u2019s motivation or intention, if such motivation or intention is a fact in issue and the statement is tendered by a party adverse in interest. Such out-of-court statements by other CRA employees could be proven by Ms. Coles\u2019 notes.\n[6] Mr. McFadgen\u2019s point, as I understand it, is that the intentions or motivations of CRA\u2019s staff are not facts in issue in the prosecution, but only on the application by Mr. & Ms. McCartie to exclude the bank records from evidence. The nub of his submission is that the Crown\u2019s duty to preserve and disclose evidence is limited to evidence bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence, and does not extend to evidence bearing on an alleged infringement of a Charter right. Mr. McFadgen referred me to no authority in which such a limitation is expressly stated, and I am not aware of any.\n[7] I do not think that the Crown\u2019s duty to preserve and disclose evidence should be limited as proposed by Mr. McFadgen. It seems to me unreasonable to suggest that evidence which may assist the accused to prove an infringement of a Charter right, and so to support an application for a judicial stay of the prosecution, is less important or less worthy of preservation than evidence which may assist the accused to establish a substantive defence to the charge or to impugn the credibility of Crown witnesses. I observe that the duty to preserve evidence was described in Regina vs La as a logical extension of the duty to disclose established by Regina vs Stinchcombe. It is well-settled that the disclosure obligation is not confined to documents which would be admissible in evidence, but extends to documents, like witness statements, which might be useful to the defence in other ways. To take another example, a police recording of an interrogation of the accused must be disclosed because it may assist the accused to challenge the voluntariness of any statements made by the accused or to establish an infringement of his Charter rights during the interrogation.\n[8] However, I think it important to acknowledge that the Crown\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence relevant to infringements of Charter rights is subject to the same limitations as the Crown\u2019s obligation to preserve evidence relevant to the substantive elements of the offence. For example, in Regina vs La at paragraph 21, Sopinka, J said:\nThe police cannot be expected to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the future. In addition, even the loss of relevant evidence will not result in a breach of the duty to disclose if the conduct of the police is reasonable. But as the relevance of the evidence increases, so does the degree of care for its preservation that is expected of the police.\nI have not yet heard submissions on the question whether it would be reasonable to expect CRA to preserve Ms. Coles\u2019 notes in this case.\n\u2026\n[10] Mr. McFadgen says that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes are not \u201c\u2026 fruits of the investigation \u2026\u201d because they are not records of information obtained from others, but rather records of CRA\u2019s internal proceedings. Ms. Coles describes her notes as including both types of information. However, the purpose for which they are presently sought is to assist in determining the state of mind of CRA staff at the relevant times.\n[11] It is difficult to answer the question without seeing the notes. In light of Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence, it is reasonable to infer that the notes might contain one or more of the following:\na. references to information obtained by CRA from outside sources which might reasonably lead the reader to conclude that Mr. or Ms. McCartie had committed an offence of tax evasion;\nb. notes of oral statements by CRA employees to the effect that they had, or had not, reached such a conclusion, firmly or tentatively;\nc. expressions of intention by CRA employees in relation to possible prosecution of Mr. or Ms. McCartie.\nReferences of the first kind might support an inference that, as at the date of the meeting recorded in the note, CRA intended to prosecute, because any reasonable person in possession of such information would form that intention. Notes of the second or third kind might be direct evidence of such an intention. References of the first kind might be properly described as \u201c\u2026 fruits of the investigation \u2026\u201d. Notes of the second or third kind would not.\nTHE THIRD QUESTION\n[12] In Regina vs La at paragraph 20, Sopinka, J said:\nThe right of disclosure would be a hollow one if the Crown were not required to preserve evidence that is known to be relevant. Yet despite the best efforts of the Crown to preserve evidence, owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost. The principle in Stinchcombe (No. 2), supra, recognizes this unfortunate fact. Where the Crown's explanation satisfies the trial judge that the evidence has not been destroyed or lost owing to unacceptable negligence, the duty to disclose has not been breached. Where the Crown is unable to satisfy the judge in this regard, it has failed to meet its disclosure obligations, and there has accordingly been a breach of s. 7 of the Charter. Such a failure may also suggest that an abuse of process has occurred, but that is a separate question. It is not necessary that an accused establish abuse of process for the Crown to have failed to meet its s. 7 obligation to disclose.\nThat passage seems to me to place on the Crown the onus of proving how the missing documents came to be lost. In the absence of any admissible evidence on the point, the court is bound to infer that they were lost deliberately or by unacceptable negligence.\n[Emphasis added]\n(v) McCartie 2015 BCPC 69 (McCartie 2015-2) [48] This was an application by the McCarties for a judicial stay of their prosecution on the basis that, in their particular prevailing circumstances, it was impossible for them to have a fair trial as they are entitled to under section 11(d) of the Charter.\n[49] Judge Gouge\u2019s summary of the issues, prevailing circumstances and questions, are attached, along with his summary of evidence, as Appendix B.\n[50] Judge Gouge decided the application on the basis that the McCarties had the onus to prove the facts they alleged and most importantly that CRA\u2019s predominant purpose in December 2008 was to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution when they made the December 2008 Request For Information (\u201cRFI\u201d) from the McCarties\u2019 banks, following a November 2008 meeting with the McCarties.\n[51] He went on to summarize the McCarties\u2019 hypotheses that:\n[15] Ms. Coles said that, when she issued the demands to the banks, she had no interest in a criminal investigation. She said that her job was to conduct civil audits of tax returns, and that was what she did in relation to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Mr. & Ms. McCartie tell me that they do not challenge Ms. Coles\u2019 veracity. However, they do advance the following hypothesis:\na. In 2005, Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan formed the opinion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were guilty of tax evasion, but that CRA lacked the evidence to support a prosecution.\nb. Mr. Brown recommended a further audit in 2007 for the purpose of gathering the necessary evidence.\nc. Ms. Coles was the unwitting tool of the Investigations Department, and was used by the Investigations Department to procure the evidence from the banks.\n[52] Judge Gouge went on to a detailed summary of Ms. Coles\u2019 evidence regarding her notes involving the McCarties\u2019 audit and her interactions with Criminal Investigations and with Mr. McLachlan. Ms. Coles followed her normal note-taking practice throughout the McCarties\u2019 audits, she entered her T2020 notes of the McCarties audit on CRA\u2019s computer system, and she gave her handwritten notes to Mr. McLachlan when she transferred the file to him in 2009. She believes that she may not have met with her predecessor Mr. Chabot when she assumed conduct of the audits from him, as would have been her practice. If they did meet, she would have entered her notes of the meeting on a T2020 also. Ms. Coles met with Mr. Brown at an early stage of her McCartie audit and made detailed notes of that meeting on a T2020. Ms. Coles attended at Criminal Investigations when she was first assigned to the file to review the informer tip, that she said she did not discuss it with anyone in Criminal Investigations and did not have any other communications with Criminal Investigations regarding the McCarties until after Mr. McLachlan formally referred their file to Criminal Investigations. Upon receipt of Mr. McCartie\u2019s letter of August 2008 espousing a natural person tax exemptions theory, she probably reviewed it with her Team Leader at a meeting, and, if so, she would have recorded the substance of their discussion and the conclusion reached in the T2020. Following a November 2008 meeting of the McCarties with Ms. Coles and her colleague Mr. Lecznar, Mr. Lecznar gave Ms. Coles his handwritten notes of the meeting which she used along with her own to write notes to prepare her T2020. These handwritten notes are among the Coles\u2019 Notes that CRA has lost. Ms. Coles also prepared the T2020 of her meeting with her Audit colleague, Mr. Lidster, at which they decided to issue requirements to the McCarties\u2019 bankers. Ms. Coles did not prepare a T2020 following her April 2009 meeting with Mr. McLachlan to acquaint him with the McCarties\u2019 files as responsibility had been reassigned to him when she was transferred to other duties in late 2009 and she expected Mr. McLachlan would do that.\n[53] When Ms. Coles was asked to produce her notes, including her T2020 notes, she looked for them but could not find them. She last saw them when she handed her file to Mr. McLachlan. Some of her handwritten notes relating to the McCarties\u2019 audit have been produced but none of her T2020 notes. Judge Gouge was informed by counsel appearing on the application that they had been \u201clost\u201d.\n[54] Judge Gouge summarized the evidence regarding the loss of the Coles Notes and other CRA notes as follows:\n[32] In a letter to Mr. & Ms. McCartie dated August 15, 2103, Mr. Gibson, then Crown counsel, said:\nWe understand that T2020 notes are ordinarily kept during the course of an audit. We have made enquiries in this regard. Unfortunately, we understand that, due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases, the T2020 entries were not retained in this matter. We understand that you have all available T2020 notes\/Memo For File notes that have been retained.\nIn a letter to Mr. Preshaw (who succeeded Mr. Gibson as Crown counsel) dated July 18, 2014, Mr. Gibson said:\nI now understand that the McCarties interpreted my correspondence as confirmation that further notes did exist, were not disclosed, and were lost through the database design. I do not know if this was the case. I cannot verify what notes were originally created by CRA. My primary concern, upon drafting the letter, was to indicate that there were no further materials to provide and to advise the McCarties of the possibility that notes may have been deleted. Questions as to whether notes were actually lost should be directed to the relevant CRA employees.\nMs. Coles was quite clear in her evidence that she did make T-2020 notes of the McCartie audit. Mr. McFadgen was equally clear in his assertion at the hearing before me that they have been lost. The source of Mr. Gibson\u2019s assertion that the notes were lost \u201c\u2026 due to design issues of the relevant CRA databases \u2026\u201d has not been identified. No other information has been provided to assist in determining how or when the notes came to be lost.\n[55] Judge Gouge went on to address documents that CRA might be expected to have created but may never have existed, and their relevance to the stay application he was deciding. Neither the Assistant Director of Criminal Investigations Ms. Etches, nor Investigator Chan had yet testified. The Crown advised that neither of them had any recollection of their meeting with Auditor Brown in 2005 and that \u201cno notes of that meeting exist\u201d. All parties asked that the stay application not await further testimony of Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, and the Court proceeded on that basis in fairness to the accused McCarties. The McCarties\u2019 assertion on the stay application was that the failure to make notes of that meeting by Etches, Chan and Brown impairs the McCarties\u2019 ability to effectively cross-examine any of Brown, Etches or Chan as to their intentions and motives, and this has the effect of denying them their right to a fair trial.\n[56] In his reasons, Judge Gouge emphasised that appropriate pre-trial disclosure is essential to a fair trial, and that a failure to make such disclosure may render the trial unfair. He framed the questions he was deciding on this application as \u201cwhether, in light of what CRA did, or did not do, in relation to making and retaining notes, the trial upon which I am now engaged is as fair as it could reasonably be expected to be. If the answer to that question is \u201cno\u201d, then Mr. and Ms. McCartie are denied their right to a fair trial. Such a conclusion does not necessary imply a finding of misconduct on the part of CRA\u201d.\n[57] Judge Gouge wrote of Ms. Coles and her notes as follows:\n[43] I accept, as do Mr. & Ms. McCartie, that Ms. Coles was a truthful witness, who did her best to recount accurately the events in which she participated. It necessarily follows that her intention or motivation was solely to conduct a civil audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns. That fact does not preclude the possibility that she was used by others to gather evidence for a prosecution. The present question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that her lost notes would assist in proving that fact. I think that there is.\n[44] In paragraph 6, above, I quote certain passages from Mr. Brown\u2019s contemporaneous notes which cast doubt on his assertion that, in 2005, he suspected Mr. & Ms. McCartie of gross negligence in the preparation of their returns, but not of fraud. In paragraph 10, I quote his recommendation to initiate the second audit, in the course of which CRA obtained the bank records. In my view, that document is consistent only with a suspicion on the part of Mr. Brown that Mr. & Ms. McCartie were guilty of tax fraud. Mr. Brown and Ms. Coles met at the inception of her audit. She has now no independent recollection of that meeting. It is reasonably probable that, at the meeting, Mr. Brown told her what he had discovered in the course of his earlier audit and what conclusions he had reached. If he had done so, Ms. Coles, in accordance with her usual practice, would have recorded those remarks in her T-2020 notes. It would be instructive to compare: (i) what Mr. Brown said in his 2005 notes (quoted in paragraph 6 above); (ii) what Mr. Brown said in his 2007 recommendation (quoted in paragraph 10, above); (iii) what Mr. Brown said to Ms. Coles (which would have been recorded in Ms. Coles lost notes); and (iv) Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence at this trial.\n[45] Ms. Coles attended at the offices of the Investigations Department at the inception of her audit to review the informer tip. She says that she did not speak with anyone in the Investigations Department about the file. Of course, that cannot be literally true - someone in the Investigations Department must have pulled the tip from the file and given it to her to review. Some words must have been exchanged. Ms. Coles\u2019 memory of the event is, understandably, vague. It would be unreasonable to exclude the possibility that a discussion took place which was recorded in the lost notes. Accepting, as I do, Ms. Coles\u2019 honesty, there may well have been something in that discussion which would be of assistance to the defence, although Ms. Coles attributed no significance to it at the time.\n[46] Ms. Coles met with her team leader, Mr. Lidster, after she and Mr. Leczner met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie and before Ms. Coles issued her statutory demands to the banks. The purpose of the meeting was to seek Mr. Lidster\u2019s authorization to issue the demands. Ms. Coles\u2019 lost notes contained a record of that meeting. It is possible that Mr. Lidster made comments similar to those quoted in paragraph 10. If so, they would be capable of supporting an inference that Mr. Lidster suspected Mr. & Ms. McCarty of fraud. That, in turn, might support an inference that Mr. Lidster was interested in a prosecution when he authorized the demands to be issued to the banks.\n[47] I conclude that there is a real possibility that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes would have been of assistance to the defence and that the Crown has not discharged its onus of proving that they were not lost by unacceptable negligence. It follows from those two conclusions that there has been an infringement of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. In R vs Carosella @ paragraph 37, Justice Sopinka said:\nThe right to disclosure of material which meets the Stinchcombe threshold is one of the components of the right to make full answer and defence which in turn is a principle of fundamental justice embraced by s. 7 of the Charter. Breach of that obligation is a breach of the accused's constitutional rights without the requirement of an additional showing of prejudice. To paraphrase Lamer C.J. in Tran, the breach of this principle of fundamental justice is in itself prejudicial. The requirement to show additional prejudice or actual prejudice relates to the remedy to be fashioned pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.\n[48] In this case, the Crown has offered no explanation for the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes. There is no basis upon which I could conclude that they were not lost by unacceptable negligence. Accordingly, I must conclude that there has been a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 7 of the Charter.\n(Emphasis added)\n[58] Judge Gouge wrote of the absence of note taking by all other than Ms. Coles, and their impact on the fairness of the trial to the McCarties, as follows:\n[49] Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that the omission by Mr. Brown, Mr. Lidster, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes of their communications is a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under sections 7 and 11 of the Charter. During argument, the parties characterized this issue as raising the question whether those individuals had a duty to make notes in the circumstances pertaining. Mr. & Mrs. McCartie also complained of the failure of Mr. McLachlan to make notes. However, I consider that to be of no significance because the question is CRA\u2019s motive or intention in December, 2008, when notices were delivered to compel disclosure of the bank documents, and Mr. McLachlan had no role in the case until the spring of 2009.\n[50] Mr. & Ms. McCartie say that the duty to make notes arises from two sources:\na. They say that there is a legal duty, of general application, on police officers to make notes, and the same duty should apply to CRA investigators.\nb. They refer to many entries in CRA policy manuals and training materials, which instruct CRA investigators to make and retain detailed notes.\n[51] In support of the first proposition, they rely on Wood vs Schaeffer 2013 SCC 71 (CanLII), [2013] 3 SCR 1053. However, I note that Wood vs Schaeffer was concerned with the application of a particular Ontario regulation, having the force of statute, which expressly imposed specific obligations on Ontario police officers to make notes in specific circumstances. I was referred to no statute which imposes a similar obligation on CRA staff. In the absence of such a statute, I think that the legal position was correctly stated in Regina vs Davidoff 2013 ABQB 244; i.e. note-taking is a prudent and responsible police practice, but not a legal obligation.\n[52] I do consider CRA\u2019s policies and training manuals to be of significance. I discuss that issue in paragraphs 60 - 61, below. However, they do not create legal duties: Hewko vs British Columbia 2006 BCSC 1638; [2006] BCJ #2877 @ paragraphs 313 \u2013 318.\n[53] I conclude that the CRA staff were under no legal obligation to make notes.\nTRIAL FAIRNESS\n[54] Having addressed the application on the basis advanced by the parties, I return to my own view of the matter. To my mind, there are two questions:\na. Does the absence of contemporaneous notes materially impair the fairness of this trial?\nb. If so, is it reasonable to expect that CRA would have prepared and preserved such notes?\nI think that the first question is mandated by section 11(d) of the Charter and the second question by Thomson Newspapers @ paragraphs 170 \u2013 178. If the answer to each question is \u201cyes\u201d, there has been an infringement of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter right to a fair trial.\n[55] These are different questions from the question whether CRA staff had a legal duty to take notes. As I have said, I do not think that they did. I find nothing in section 11(d) to support the inference that an unfair trial constitutes a denial of the Charter right only where the unfairness results from a breach of a legal duty by a government agent. Section 11(d) simply says that an accused person is entitled to a fair trial. If the trial is unfair, having regard to the principle that it need only be as fair reasonably possible, the right to a fair trial is infringed. There may be cases in which a fair trial is precluded by some unfortunate accident which is the fault of no one. In such a case, it may be that an unfair trial cannot be allowed to proceed, subject always to the balancing of public and private interests described in Thomson Newspapers. In this case, if it would have been reasonable to expect Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes, and they did not, and the result is an unfair trial, the consequence may be that the trial cannot proceed.\n\u2026\n[57] In order to assess the effect of the lost and missing notes on trial fairness, it is necessary to consider the formidable task which Mr. & Ms. McCartie face on the Jarvis issue. They carry the onus of proving, in 2015, the states of mind of three hostile witnesses (Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan) in 2005 \u2013 2007. If the question were whether a witness performed some physical act 10 years ago, one might hope to find an independent witness to the event or some physical evidence that the act occurred. In some cases, the state of mind of a witness can be proven by reference to actions taken or omitted by the witness. For example, a person who is angry with another rarely seeks the company of the other. In this case, it is difficult to imagine how the state of mind of Ms. Etches, Mr. Brown or Mr. Chan could be proven except by leading evidence of words which they uttered. The Crown asserts, and the defence accepts for the purpose of this application, that they have no present recollection of what they said in 2005. Even assuming that they would be completely candid when cross-examined, it would not be possible to prove their state of mind because they don\u2019t remember what they said. The only avenue of cross-examination open to Mr. & Ms. McCartie would be to put to the witnesses the proposition that, in 2005, they suspected Mr. & Ms. McCartie of tax evasion and launched the second audit in search of evidence to prove it. It seems safe to assume that the witnesses would deny any such intention. There would be no further question which the cross-examiner could usefully ask.\n[58] By contrast, if notes had been made, the notes might well offer ammunition to the cross-examiner. By way of example, I refer to the documents authored by Mr. Brown (paragraphs 6, 10, above).\n[59] Of course, one cannot say whether the notes would have been helpful to the defence unless one has seen the notes. In that circumstance, the question is whether there is a real possibility that they would have been: Regina vs Carosella @ paragraphs 30 \u2013 36. I conclude that such a real possibility exists in this case, and so conclude that the first of my two questions should be answered in the affirmative.\n[60] The next question is whether it would be reasonable to expect Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make and retain notes of their communications. Two items of evidence cause me to answer that question in the affirmative.\na. Ms. Coles did, as a matter of routine. There was nothing in her evidence to indicate that she found the practice to be burdensome or impractical. If she had attended the 2005 meeting, rather than Mr. Brown, she would have made a detailed T-2020 note of the meeting, including the substance of the discussion, the decision taken and the reasons for the decision. Nothing in the evidence supports the conclusion that it would have been more difficult for Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches or Mr. Chan to do so.\nb. CRA\u2019s policy and training manuals contain many instructions to CRA staff to make and retain detailed notes. To take only the most apposite of many examples, CRA\u2019s training manual for investigators recommends that the investigator interview the auditor after reviewing the auditor\u2019s file and before deciding to proceed with an investigation. In relation to that interview, the manual states:\nTake notes of the interview. It is imperative that notes be taken during the interview or as soon after as possible. Those notes should be as accurate as possible. They can be handwritten or typed. However, your handwritten notes must be retained for future reference. They could possible (sic) be called into question during the trial.\nIt seems to me that it cannot be unreasonable to expect CRA investigators to comply with the instructions of their management on the point in question.\n[61] I hasten to say that, in my view, the reasonableness of an expectation that an investigator take and retain notes is highly fact-specific. For example, very different factors would require consideration in the case of a police officer conducting a traffic stop or executing a search warrant at a crack house.\n[62] Having answered both of my questions in the affirmative, I conclude that Mr. & Ms. McCartie have been denied their right to a fair trial.\n(Emphasis added)\n[59] See also the close of paragraph 68 dealing with costs and whether these were extraordinary circumstances wherein Judge Gouge repeats that this was not a case of misconduct on the part of CRA. \u201cIt has failed to discharge its onus of proof in relation to the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes, but there is no evidence from which I could infer deliberate destruction of those notes, or culpable negligence causing their loss. The omission of Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan to make notes was not culpable\u2014they were under no obligation to make them. The omission to make and keep them has prevented Mr. and Mrs. McCartie from exercising their rights to a fair trial, but that does not render their omission culpable. I do not consider this an exceptional case in which the omission to make notes rises to the level of an abuse of process\u201d.\n(Emphasis added)\n[60] Judge Gouge went on to conclude that the appropriate remedy in the McCarties\u2019 particular circumstances was not to stay the proceedings at that time, but to restrict what evidence the Crown could rely on:\n[66] The only alternative remedy suggested by Mr. McFadgen is the possibility that, when assessing the credibility of Mr. Brown, Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, I should take into account the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes and the omission of the others to make notes. In my view, that remedy would be inadequate to address the prejudice to Mr. & Ms. McCartie. They carry the onus of proving CRA\u2019s motive and intentions. That onus can be discharged only by affirmative evidence. An adverse inference may assist in corroborating or reinforcing affirmative evidence, but is not a substitute for affirmative evidence. For that reason, it has been held that \u201c\u2026an adverse inference will not be drawn where the effect of drawing such an inference is to reverse the onus of proof \u2026\u201d: McIlvenna vs Viebeg 2012 BCSC 218; [2012] BCJ #292 @ paragraph 70. At present, the only affirmative evidence of CRA\u2019s motive and intentions consists of: (i) Mr. Brown\u2019s notes, quoted in paragraphs 6, 10, above; and (ii) the notable circumstance that Mr. Brown proposed the second audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns, in the course of which the bank documents were procured, within a month or so of his return to the Audit Department from the Investigations Department. Coupled with an adverse inference, that evidence might support a conclusion that the hypothesis advanced by Mr. & Ms. McCartie is correct, but it is not a strong case for the defence. By comparison, if Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan had kept notes, and if they had expressed themselves in a manner similar to Mr. Brown, the notes might have presented a compelling case for the McCartie hypothesis.\n[67] However, I do not think that a judicial stay of the prosecution is necessary. The prejudice to Mr. & Ms. McCartie can be remedied by excluding from evidence all documents procured by CRA by the exercise of its statutory powers during the second audit. If the Crown can prove its case without those documents, it should do so.\n\u2026\n[69] All documents procured by CRA by the exercise of its statutory powers during the second audit (conducted by Ms. Coles and Mr. McLachlan) will be excluded from evidence.\n(Emphasis added)\n(vi) McCartie 2015 BCPC 233 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-3\u201d) [61] In this application Judge Gouge was deciding whether Ms. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights were infringed during a search of the McCarties\u2019 home by CRA Criminal Investigations agents and the RCMP in August of 2010. Ms. McCartie was at home with their daughter; Mr. McCartie was not present at the time of the search. If so, the application was also asking to exclude from evidence the documents seized by CRA during that search. Judge Gouge stated at the outset that he would refrain from commenting on whether the conduct of the CRA investigator is deserving of criticism because those issues had not been fully argued.\n[62] The pertinent evidence was from Investigator Sundberg who was in charge of the search, and Mr. Stenchman, an Investigator who was assisting her, as well as RCMP Constable Reynolds. To the extent their testimony differed, Judge Gouge accepted Mr. Stenchman\u2019s testimony.\n[63] Investigator Sundberg applied for and was granted a warrant to search the McCarties\u2019 Nanaimo home on August 30, 2010. The following morning at 9:00 a.m. Ms. Sundberg attended the McCarties\u2019 home accompanied by Mr. Stenchman, Constable Reynolds, eight other CRA Investigators, and one other RCMP Officer. (In his testimony in this voir dire before me, Mr. Jones, head of Criminal Investigations in Vancouver, said he was among those present throughout.)\n[64] Ms. Sundberg went to the front door accompanied by Mr. Stenchman and Constable Reynolds in uniform. Ms. Sundberg had a copy of the search warrant in her hand, and the original search warrant under her arm.\n[65] Upon answering the door with the security latch on, Ms. Sundberg informed Ms. McCartie she had a warrant and demanded Ms. McCartie open the door. Ms. McCartie asked for the warrant. Ms. Sundberg did not give it to her but replied by asserting that Ms. McCartie was obliged to open the door and that, if she did, Ms. Sundberg will enter the house and go over the warrant with her. Ms. McCartie said she was going to call a lawyer and closed the door. About a minute later, Ms. McCartie opened the door again with the security latch in place. Constable Reynolds told her that Ms. Sundberg had a warrant and that Ms. McCartie was obliged to open the door. Constable Reynolds told her that he had authority to break down the door, and that he would do so unless she opened it immediately. Ms. McCartie closed the door again.\n[66] A few minutes later Ms. McCartie unlatched and opened her front door. Accompanied by her daughter, she stepped outside of the house and again asked for the warrant. Ms. Sundberg\u2019s reply was that if Ms. McCartie would go in to the house with her, she would go over the warrant with her. Ms. McCartie declined that invitation. Ms. McCartie then walked with her daughter to their vehicle and drove off. The door was left at least somewhat opened; Judge Gouge does not suggest whether this was intentional or an oversight. There is no suggestion in his reasons that it could have been considered an invitation to enter without showing her the search warrant.\n[67] Both RCMP officers then entered the house to satisfy themselves there were no threats to the investigators\u2019 safety. The CRA Criminal Investigations\u2019 investigators then entered and search the house and seized a number of documents.\n[68] Judge Gouge then considered the requirements of section 29(1) of the Criminal Code which provides:\n\u201cIt is the duty of everyone who executes a process or warrant to have it with him, where it is feasible to do so, and to produce it when requested to do so\u201d\n\u00ab Quiconque ex\u00e9cute un acte judiciaire ou un mandat est tenu de l\u2019avoir sur soi, si la chose est possible, et de le produire lorsque demande lui en est faite \u00bb\n[69] When asked by Judge Gouge why she did not give Ms. McCartie the copy of the warrant in her hand when asked, Ms. Sundberg\u2019s reasons included that she wanted to offer Ms. McCartie the chance to go over the warrant after she was inside the house to induce Ms. McCartie to let her inside the house. That is \u201cshe wanted to use the document as a lever to induce Ms. McCartie first, to open the door and allow Sundberg to enter, second, to identify herself, and, third, to engage in a discussion of the warrant with Ms. Sundberg\u201d. In the circumstances Judge Gouge also wrote \u201cunless and until shown a copy of the warrant Ms. McCartie was under no obligation to open the door\u201d nor to identify herself. He also wrote \u201cMs. McCartie was under no obligation to speak with Ms. Sundberg. Indeed, as a person under investigation, she was wise to decline that invitation.\u201d Ms. Sundberg also said that in her opinion she was not obliged to produce the warrant or give Ms. McCartie a copy until she had executed the warrant, which would not be until she crossed the threshold, which she had not yet done when asked by Ms. McCartie.[8]\n[70] Judge Gouge found that none of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s explanations rendered it impracticable for her to have given Ms. McCartie a copy when she first asked for it. He also gave very short shrift to the Crown\u2019s more technical arguments that to produce it did not mean to provide a copy, that the RCMP had not yet ensured that entering the house was safe, and the possibility that evidence was being destroyed as they spoke outside the home.\n[71] Judge Gouge wrote about the failures of Ms. Sundberg and Constable Reynolds:\n[18] There was a simple, easy and harmless mode of production available to Ms. Sundberg which would not require Ms. McCartie to open her house to strangers. I conclude that such was the mode of production required by the statute in the circumstances.\n[19] Mr. McFadgen cited no authority in support of his third point, and I have found none which discusses when a warrant may be said to have been \u201cexecuted\u201d. None of the dictionaries which I have consulted offer enlightenment.\n[20] In Bohn at paragraph 31, Justice Ryan quoted the following passage with approval:\nThe reason for the requirement that an officer executing the warrant have it available for production, is to allow the occupant of the searched premises to know: (1) why the search is being carried out, so as to enable the occupant to properly assess his or her legal position; and (2) that there is, at least, a colour of authority for the search and that forcible resistance is improper. This last rationale also plays a role in the second procedural requirement for a valid search, that the peace officers announce themselves before entering the premises to be searched.\nThose objectives would be rendered entirely moot if the occupant is not entitled to see the warrant before the searchers cross the threshold. Once the searchers enter the home, the violation of privacy has already occurred and the opportunity to resist an unauthorized intrusion has passed. The purpose of section 29(1) is to entitle the occupant of a house to satisfy herself as to the searcher\u2019s legal authority to enter the house before the occupant is obliged to allow the searcher to enter. The section is perfectly clear. The occupant is not required to accept the searcher\u2019s assertion that she has a warrant and a right to enter. The occupant is entitled to demand production of the warrant, as Ms. McCartie did.\n[21] Section 29(1) imposes a production obligation on a class of persons; i.e. those who execute warrants. That, in itself, does not tell us when such persons must produce the warrant. The time is determined by the final phrase of section 29(1); i.e. \u201c\u2026 when requested to do so\u201d. Ms. Sundberg was plainly a person who executed a warrant. While she was in the course of doing so, Ms. McCartie asked her to produce the warrant. Applying the plain words of the section, Ms. Sundberg was obliged to do so when the request was made. I do not say that a person executing a warrant must always respond instantly to a request for production. Circumstances may render it impracticable to do so. However, the person must comply with the request as soon as it is practicable to do so. In this case, as noted above, it would have been perfectly practicable for Ms. Sundberg to do so immediately upon Ms. McCartie\u2019s first request.\n[22] I conclude that, in this case, Ms. Sundberg failed to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code.\n(Emphasis added)\n[72] Judge Gouge went on to conclude that this was a breach of Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights:\n[23] Section 8 of the Charter provides:\nEveryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\nAs noted above, in Bohn, Justice Ryan said at paragraph 34:\nFailure to produce the warrant on request, without good reason, is in my view, a significant breach of s. 8.\nI am bound to follow that direction unless it has subsequently been overruled by the Supreme Court of Canada. In R vs Patrick 2007 ABCA 308; [2007] AJ No. 1130; [2008] 1 WWR 600; 227 CCC (3d) 525, Justice Ritter said at paragraph 49:\nI do not agree with the analysis in Bohn that failure to comply with s. 29 of the Criminal Code necessarily creates a s. 8 Charter breach. What is protected are unreasonable searches, which depends the reasonableness of the police's grounds after authorization by a judicial officer, rather than procedural niceties.\nJustice Ritter\u2019s judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada: 2009 SCC 17 (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 579. However, the point under discussion here is not mentioned in the Supreme Court of Canada judgment. The basis of the majority judgment was stated by Justice Binnie in the following terms at paragraph 73:\n\u2026 I agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal majority in this case that the appellant had abandoned his privacy interest in the contents of the garbage bags gathered up by the police when he placed them in the garbage alcove open to the laneway ready for collection. The taking by the police did not constitute a search and seizure within the scope of s. 8, and the evidence (as well as the fruits of the search warrant obtained in reliance on such evidence) was properly admissible.\nThat being so, I cannot conclude that, in Patrick, the Supreme Court of Canada overruled Bohn, and I am bound to apply Bohn in this case. I note also that Bohn was followed, on this point, in R vs Fan 2013 BCSC 1406; [2013] BCJ No. 1710 at paragraphs 70 - 74, and that Fan is also an authority binding upon me.\n[24] Accordingly, I am bound to conclude that Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code infringed Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 8 of the Charter, unless the evidence discloses a \u201cgood reason\u201d for that failure. In paragraph 12, above, I identified the reasons given by Ms. Sundberg. In paragraphs 13 - 21, I explained why those were not good reasons. I do not think that they justify her failure to comply with section 29(1).\n[25] As no good reason has been established for Ms. Sundberg\u2019s failure to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code, it follows that her conduct infringed Ms. McCartie\u2019s rights under section 8 of the Charter.\n[73] While the Tax Court is not so strictly bound by the BC Court of Appeal, I will not, and have not been asked to, revisit Judge Gouge\u2019s finding of a breach of Ms. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights for any reason. The principals of judicial comity, deference and common sense apply here. As the home was also Mr. McCartie\u2019s home, and housed his property, I accept that his section 8 Charter rights against unreasonable search or seizure were also breached by this squad of CRA Criminal Investigations and RCMP that morning. I was not asked to do otherwise.\n[74] As noted below in McCartie 2015-4, Judge Gouge found that the execution of the search warrant was also a breach of Mr. McCartie\u2019s section 8 Charter rights. Also, as noted below in McCartie 2015-4, Judge Gouge quashed the search warrant itself, further rendering the search and seizure to be unlawful and a section 8 Charter breach.\n(vii) McCartie 2015 BCPC 254 (\u201cMcCartie 2015-4\u201d) [75] In this decision, Judge Gouge was dealing with the McCarties\u2019 request for an order excluding certain documents seized from their home under the authority of the search warrant described above. This is the search and seizure found by Judge Gouge in McCartie 2015-3 to have been unreasonable. The exclusion of the seized documents is the remedy that the McCarties both sought as appropriate and just under section 24 of the Charter for the breach of their Charter rights under section 8. Judge Gouge begins by pointing out, very correctly, that he is deciding this in the context of the McCarties\u2019 criminal trial and that the legal principals governing the exclusion of evidence in criminal proceedings differ in some respects from those applicable in civil proceedings for the collection of taxes and civil penalties from the McCarties. He is clear that he expresses no opinion in relation to the admissibility of evidence in any civil proceeding in this Court.\n[76] In his Background, Judge Gouge wrote:\n[4] On a previous application, Mr. & Ms. McCartie sought a judicial stay of this prosecution, on the ground that CRA had infringed their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms by exercising CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers to compel Mr. & Ms. McCartie to disclose information to CRA at a time when CRA\u2019s predominant purpose was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution: R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757. In order to decide that application, it would be necessary to determine the date on which CRA\u2019s predominant objective changed from a civil audit to a criminal prosecution. I was unable to determine that date because: (i) some of CRA\u2019s internal documents have been lost; (ii) some CRA employees omitted to create other documents, which they would normally have prepared and which would have provided insight into CRA\u2019s motives and objectives from time to time. As a result, the Charter breach alleged by Mr. & Ms. McCartie was not proven. However, I concluded that, unless an appropriate remedy were granted, the loss of some CRA documents, and the omission to create others, would result in a breach of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s right (under section 11(d) of the Charter) to a fair trial. In order to prevent that Charter breach, I ordered that the documents procured by CRA during its audit be excluded from evidence: R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No.636.\n[5] It should be noted that I did not conclude that the loss of some CRA documents, or the omission to create other CRA documents, was a breach of the Charter. Rather, I concluded that: (i) those events would result in an unfair trial unless the evidence procured during the audit were excluded from the trial; and (ii) an accused person has a right to a fair trial whether or not the impediment to a fair trial arises from Crown misconduct. The order which I made was a prophylactic against an imminent Charter breach, rather than a remedy for a Charter breach which had previously occurred.[9]\n[6] Mr. & Ms. McCartie then applied to quash the search warrant, on the ground that much of the evidence described in the information to obtain (\u201cthe ITO\u201d) had been procured by CRA during the civil audit. On the hearing of that application, Mr. McFadgen, for the Crown, very properly conceded that all of the evidence procured during the civil audit should be redacted from the ITO, and that the question on the application was whether a search warrant could properly have been issued on the basis of the redacted ITO. Mr. McFadgen and Mr. & Ms. McCarty were able to agree on the appropriate redactions, and presented me with a redacted ITO for consideration. It was immediately apparent that no search warrant could properly have been issued on the basis of the redacted ITO, and I quashed the warrant for that reason.[10]\n[7] Ms. McCartie then applied for a declaration that CRA had infringed her Charter rights because, when CRA investigators attended at the McCartie home to execute the warrant, they refused her request for production of the warrant before they entered her home. I concluded that Ms. McCartie\u2019s complaint was well-founded, and granted the declaration which she sought: R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 233. Mr. Jones, for the Crown, concedes that Mr. McCartie is entitled to the same declaration because, although he was not at home at the time of the search, his Charter-protected privacy rights in his home were infringed by the refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request.\n[8] Two breaches of section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms have been established:\na. The consequence of my decision to quash the search warrant is that the search of the McCartie home was not authorized by law. A search which is not authorized by law is an unreasonable search: R vs Klimchuk 1991 CanLII 3958 (BC CA), [1991] BCJ No. 2872; 67 CCC (3d) 385.\nb. The refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request for production of the search warrant before the investigators entered the house was, itself, a breach of section 8: R vs Bohn [2000] BCJ No. 867; 2000 BCCA 239; 145 CCC (3d) 320.\nThe question on the present application is whether the appropriate remedy for those breaches is to exclude from evidence the documents seized by CRA during the search.\n(Emphasis added)\n[77] Note there is not a published decision, nor was I provided with the transcript of Judge Gouge\u2019s decision to quash the search warrant. Therefore I am left uninformed of the reasons the Crown \"very properly conceded that all of the evidence provided procured during the civil audit should be redacted\" from the Information To Obtain (\u201cITO\u201d) for the search warrant was because of the unresolved Key Date issue, which prevented the Crown from establishing that the evidence was properly collected. Given Judge Gouge\u2019s very serious remedy of quashing the search warrant, I infer that there were significant concerns, including potentially from his in camera hearing on the informer tip and the Key Date, with accepting that the evidence to date established that CRA Criminal Investigations had not yet started looking for evidence for prosecution.\n[78] Section 24(2) of the Charter requires exclusion of evidence obtained in breach of one\u2019s Charter rights if it established that, having regard to all the circumstances, its admission in court proceedings, would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\n[79] Judge Gouge described the principles governing such a determination as follows:\n[10] The governing principles were summarized in R vs Grant 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] 2 SCR 353 @ paragraphs 67 \u2013 71 (underlining added):\nThe words of s. 24(2) capture its purpose: to maintain the good repute of the administration of justice. The term \"administration of justice\" is often used to indicate the processes by which those who break the law are investigated, charged and tried. More broadly, however, the term embraces maintaining the rule of law and upholding Charter rights in the justice system as a whole.\nThe phrase \"bring the administration of justice into disrepute\" must be understood in the long-term sense of maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system. Exclusion of evidence resulting in an acquittal may provoke immediate criticism. But s. 24(2) does not focus on immediate reaction to the individual case. Rather, it looks to whether the overall repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term, will be adversely affected by admission of the evidence. The inquiry is objective. It asks whether a reasonable person, informed of all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the Charter, would conclude that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\nSection 24(2)'s focus is not only long-term, but prospective. The fact of the Charter breach means damage has already been done to the administration of justice. Section 24(2) starts from that proposition and seeks to ensure that evidence obtained through that breach does not do further damage to the repute of the justice system.\nFinally, s. 24(2)'s focus is societal. Section 24(2) is not aimed at punishing the police or providing compensation to the accused, but rather at systemic concerns. The s. 24(2) focus is on the broad impact of admission of the evidence on the long-term repute of the justice system.\n(Emphasis added)\nA review of the authorities suggests that whether the admission of evidence obtained in breach of the Charter would bring the administration of justice into disrepute engages three avenues of inquiry, each rooted in the public interests engaged by s. 24(2), viewed in a long-term, forward-looking and societal perspective. When faced with an application for exclusion under s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society's confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct (admission may send the message the justice system condones serious state misconduct), (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights count for little), and (3) society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. The court's role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. (Underlined by Judge Gouge)\n[80] Judge Gouge went on to consider these three lines of inquiry:\nThe Three Lines of Enquiry\nThe Seriousness of CRA\u2019s Conduct\n[11] In Grant at paragraphs 72 - 75, Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Charron said:\nThe first line of inquiry relevant to the s. 24(2) analysis requires a court to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct. The more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to the Charter violation, the greater the need for the courts to dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence to the rule of law.\n\u2026\nState conduct resulting in Charter violations varies in seriousness. At one end of the spectrum, admission of evidence obtained through inadvertent or minor violations of the Charter may minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law. At the other end of the spectrum, admitting evidence obtained through a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights will inevitably have a negative effect on the public confidence in the rule of law, and risk bringing the administration of justice into disrepute.\n\u2026\n\"Good faith\" on the part of the police will also reduce the need for the court to disassociate itself from the police conduct. However, ignorance of Charter standards must not be rewarded or encouraged and negligence or wilful blindness cannot be equated with good faith \u2026.\n[12] Mr. Jones and Mr. McFadgen urge me to conclude that the CRA investigators proceeded in good faith; i.e. in the belief that they had a valid warrant and that they were not obliged to produce the warrant until they had executed it by crossing the threshold of the McCartie home. \u201cGood faith\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d are polar ends of a spectrum. In placing particular police conduct in that spectrum, it is necessary to consider whether a police officer\u2019s belief that she was acting lawfully was reasonable: R vs Caron 2011 BCCA 56; [2011] BCJ No. 200; 269 CCC (3d) 15 @ paragraphs 38 - 42.\n[13] I accept that this was not a case in which the CRA investigators who executed the search warrant deliberately disregarded Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s Charter rights. The investigators honestly believed that they were entitled to proceed as they did.\n[14] I think that the individual CRA investigators\u2019 belief that the warrant was valid was a reasonable belief. The individual investigators had no reason to doubt the validity of the warrant.\n[15] However, that factor is somewhat attenuated by the Jarvis issue.\n[16] In this case, there is evidence capable of supporting the inference that CRA used its audit powers to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. I discussed the evidence which supports that inference in two previous decisions in this case: R vs McCartie 2014 BCPC 128; [2014] BCJ No. 1227; R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No. 636.\n[17] The question whether, in this case, CRA deliberately used its audit powers to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution cannot be answered because relevant documents have been lost and others which would have been created in the ordinary course of CRA\u2019s business were not created in this case. CRA has not explained the loss of the documents or the omission to create others. For a more detailed exposition of that point, see R vs McCartie 2015 BCPC 69; [2015] BCJ No. 636 @ paragraphs 4 - 32. When I asked Mr. McFadgen for an explanation during the course of that hearing, he replied that \u201c\u2026 the explanation is that the notes were lost\u201d. I have been provided with no information about the efforts, if any, which CRA has made to investigate how records came to be lost or why others, which would normally have been prepared, were not prepared in this case. CRA\u2019s reticence on the issue of the missing documents renders it difficult to assess its corporate good (or bad) faith. I find that regrettable, because a candid explanation from CRA might have done much to encourage public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the system.\n[18] I do not think that the individual investigators\u2019 refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s demand for production of the warrant was reasonable. The investigators\u2019 position was \u201clet us in and we will show you the warrant\u201d. That position was plainly unreasonable. The obvious purpose of section 29(1) of the Criminal Code is to empower the homeowner to demand to see the legal authority for the search before allowing anyone to enter her home.\n[19] I would not describe either of the two Charter breaches in issue as \u201cinadvertent or minor\u201d. Overall, I would assess the state of mind of the individual investigators who executed the search warrant in this case as being toward the \u201cgood faith\u201d end of the spectrum, but not far from the centre.\nThe Impact of the Breach on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused\n[20] CRA conducted a search of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s home which was not authorized by law. During the search of the home, CRA seized, and subsequently searched, Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s computers. In R vs Morelli 2010 SCC 8 (CanLII), [2010] 1 SCR 253 @ paragraph 105, Justice Fish said that \u201c\u2026 it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer \u2026\u201d. I think it necessary to acknowledge that there are a number of types of bodily searches, commonly conducted by police officers, which are more intrusive than a search of a home or personal computer. With that acknowledged, a search of a person\u2019s home or personal computer is a very serious matter.\n[81] Judge Gouge included passages from R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627, including:\n[21] Mr. McFadgen urged me to take into account the following observation of Justice Reilly in R vs Dial Drug Stores Limited 2003 CanLII 23014 (ON SC), [2003] OJ No. 754; 63 OR (2d) 529:\nWith respect to the consequences related to s. 8 of the Charter, McKinlay Transport, supra, makes it clear that taxpayers have very little privacy interest in the materials and records that they are obliged to keep under the [Income Tax Act] and that they are obliged to produce during an audit.\nHowever, it is important to note that the judgment in R. McKinlay Transport 1990 CanLII 137 (SCC), [1990] 1 SCR 627, to which Justice Reilly referred, was not concerned with a criminal investigation, but rather with CRA\u2019s powers to compel production of documents in the exercise of its civil audit powers. At paragraphs 32 - 34 of McKinlay Transport, Justice Wilson said (underlining added):\nAt the beginning of my analysis I noted that the Income Tax Act was based on the principle of self-reporting and self-assessment. The Act could have provided that each taxpayer submit all his or her records to the Minister and his officials so that they might make the calculations necessary for determining each person's taxable income. The legislation does not so provide, no doubt because it would be extremely expensive and cumbersome to operate such a system. However, a self-reporting system has its drawbacks. Chief among these is that it depends for its success upon the taxpayers' honesty and integrity in preparing their returns. While most taxpayers undoubtedly respect and comply with the system, the facts of life are that certain persons will attempt to take advantage of the system and avoid their full tax liability.\nAccordingly, the Minister of National Revenue must be given broad powers in supervising this regulatory scheme to audit taxpayers' returns and inspect all records which may be relevant to the preparation of these returns. The Minister must be capable of exercising these powers whether or not he has reasonable grounds for believing that a particular taxpayer has breached the Act. Often it will be impossible to determine from the face of the return whether any impropriety has occurred in its preparation. A spot check or a system of random monitoring may be the only way in which the integrity of the tax system can be maintained. If this is the case, and I believe that it is, then it is evident that the Hunter criteria are ill-suited to determine whether a seizure under s. 231(3) of the Income Tax Act is reasonable. The regulatory nature of the legislation and the scheme enacted require otherwise. The need for random monitoring is incompatible with the requirement in Hunter that the person seeking authorization for a search or seizure have reasonable and probable grounds, established under oath, to believe that an offence has been committed. If this Hunter criterion is inapplicable, then so too must the remaining Hunter criteria since they all depend for their vitality upon the need to establish reasonable and probable grounds. For example, there is no need for an impartial arbiter capable of acting judicially since his central role under Hunter is to ensure that the person seeking the authorization has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a particular offence has been committed, that there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the authorization will turn up something relating to that particular offence, and that the authorization only goes so far as to allow the seizure of documents relevant to that particular offence.\nThis is not to say that any and all forms of search and seizure under the Income Tax Act are valid. The state interest in monitoring compliance with the legislation must be weighed against an individual's privacy interest. The greater the intrusion into the privacy interests of an individual, the more likely it will be that safeguards akin to those in Hunter will be required. Thus, when the tax officials seek entry onto the private property of an individual to conduct a search or seizure, the intrusion is much greater than a mere demand for production of documents. (Emphasis added). The reason for this is that, while a taxpayer may have little expectation of privacy in relation to his business records relevant to the determination of his tax liability, he has a significant privacy interest in the inviolability of his home. (underlined by Judge Gouge)\nTwo conclusions flow from this passage:\na. Different legal principles apply, and different public-policy issues arise, when CRA is pursuing a criminal investigation than when it is conducting a civil audit.\nb. Even when CRA is conducting a civil audit, different legal principles apply, and different public-policy issues arise, when CRA seeks to enter a private dwelling without the consent of the occupier.\n(Emphasis added)\nI conclude that Justice Reilly\u2019s comments in Dial Drug Stores are of limited, if any, application where CRA is conducting a criminal investigation, or where it seeks to enter a private dwelling without the consent of the occupier.\n[82] McKinlay was only concerned with seizure in civil tax collection proceedings. In the McCarties\u2019 case, the issue arises, as is often the case, in both their tax evasion investigation and civil tax and penalties audit. These were so intertwined by CRA that Criminal Investigations took over the audits and issued the reassessments. It can be noted that the Crown has the burden of proof in both tax evasion and civil penalties proceedings, albeit to different standards, as compared with the burden of proof with respect to the correctness of the amount of tax in dispute in this Court. (The Crown also has the burden in this proceeding on the statute-barred years.)\n[83] It can also be noted that the BC Court found two section 8 Charter breaches; section 8 Charter breaches, unlike sections 7 and 11, are not limited to criminal and penal proceedings.\n[84] Judge Gouge went on to consider the fact that Mr. McCartie\u2019s business records were also stored at their home and wrote:\n[22] Mr. McFadgen points out that the CRA investigators had received information to the effect that Mr. McCartie carried on business from his home. He relies on R vs Roy 2010 BCCA 448; [2010] BCJ No. 1999; 261 CCC (3d) 62 in support of the proposition that a person who carries on business from his home has a lesser expectation of privacy in his home than a person who uses his home solely as a residence. I accept that proposition in relation to home businesses which invite the public to attend at the home for the purpose of transacting business: R vs Contant 2008 QCCA 2514; 253 CCC (3d) 259. However, there is no indication in the evidence that Mr. or Ms. McCartie did so. There are many home businesses which do not invite their customers, or other members of the public, to attend at the residence. Mr. McCartie\u2019s business may have been one of those. In such circumstances, I do not think that the home\/business owner is entitled to any lesser expectation of privacy than anyone else.\n[23] The refusal of Ms. McCartie\u2019s request for production of the warrant had a less serious impact on the privacy rights of Mr. & Ms. McCartie [than the warrantless search and seizure at their home]. However, a Charter breach of that kind was described as \u201csignificant\u201d in Bohn @ paragraph 34. I observe that it has had a material impact on Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s sense of personal security. Simply put, they feel less safe in their home than they did before the search. That is an interest which the Charter seeks to protect.\n(Emphasis added)\n[85] Judge Gouge\u2019s overall assessment was:\n[24] Overall, I would assess the impact of the two Charter breaches in question as, cumulatively, very serious.\n(Emphasis added)\n[86] I believe Canadian taxpayers and benefit recipients can, understandably, be expected to have heightened concerns about their privacy in their own home when CRA and RCMP breached their obligation to produce a copy of the warrant and literally threaten to break down their front door. The fact the search warrant was obtained on the basis of information that should not have been in CRA\u2019s ITO for the warrant can only be expected to add to Canadians\u2019 concerns.\n[87] With respect to the third consideration, Judge Gouge noted:\nSociety\u2019s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits\n[25] This issue is particularly difficult where the offence alleged is tax evasion. Most Canadians accurately report their income and expenses, and voluntarily pay the tax which they owe. They do that because they believe that the overwhelming majority of their fellow citizens do the same. Canadians have observed the very grave consequences which have ensued in some other countries, in which the citizens have lost confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration. Once that confidence is lost, tax evasion becomes commonplace (because individual citizens\u2019 willingness to pay their fair share depends largely on their belief that others do the same), government revenues fall dramatically and a fiscal crisis ensues. Canada has avoided such consequences, at least in part, because most Canadians are confident that both the tax system and its enforcement are fair and reasonable. The maintenance of that public confidence depends on two factors:\na. CRA must diligently and vigorously pursue tax evaders. Public confidence in the fairness of the system depends, in part, on public confidence that those who do not pay their fair share will be identified, relentlessly pursued and appropriately sanctioned.\nb. CRA must proceed fairly and lawfully in its dealings with taxpayers, including those suspected of tax evasion. One cannot maintain public confidence in the fairness of a system if those charged with enforcement of the system conduct themselves unlawfully or unfairly. (Emphasis added)\nThe question is whether, in this case, a greater risk to public confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration would arise from: (i) excluding the evidence, with the attendant risk that the public will perceive that an evader escaped appropriate sanctions; or (ii) admitting the evidence, with the attendant risk that the public will perceive that the court is unwilling to require CRA to comply with applicable laws, designed to protect individual rights from government intrusion.\n[26] At paragraph 83 of Grant, Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Charron said that the \u201c\u2026 importance of the evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case is another factor that may be considered in this line of enquiry\u201d (underlining added). Mr. McFadgen and Mr. Jones inform me that the evidence seized from the McCartie home is of critical importance to the Crown\u2019s case, and that an order for the exclusion of that evidence will probably put an end to this prosecution. Mr. & Ms. McCartie agree that the evidence is very important. It seems to me that this is a knife which cuts two ways. I have in mind that the objective of the enquiry is to reach a result which fosters public confidence in the process. On the one hand, the fact that the evidence is strongly incriminating would cause public concern that its exclusion might allow tax evaders to escape punishment. On the other hand, the significance of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s privacy interest is directly proportional to the importance of the documents seized from them.\n(Emphasis added)\n[88] Judge Gouge\u2019s conclusion is:\nConclusion on the Three Lines of Enquiry\n[27] After careful reflection, I think that receipt of the evidence seized under the search warrant would pose a greater risk of injury to public confidence in the administration of justice and the fairness of the tax system than its exclusion. Applying Grant, I must therefore exclude the evidence.\n[28] Ms. Sundberg, CRA\u2019s lead investigator in this case, acknowledged that, without the documents procured during the audit process, she would have had no reasonable grounds upon which to apply for a search warrant, and would not have done so. If it were proven that CRA procured the audit documents in breach of the constraint imposed by Jarvis, it would be necessary to consider whether the principle of derivative use immunity would support exclusion of the documents seized under the search warrant: R vs RJS 1995 CanLII 121 (SCC), [1995] 1 SCR 451 @ paragraphs 160 - 204. Unless Mr. & Ms. McCartie can prove that CRA misused its audit powers, the question of derivative use immunity does not arise. The loss of CRA\u2019s internal documents, and the omission to create others, is a material impediment to the presentation of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s case on the issue of derivative use immunity.\n[29] By its unexplained and unjustified conduct in relation to its internal documents, CRA has materially impaired Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s ability to defend the charges made against them. The right to a fair trial is both guaranteed by section 11(d) the Charter and fundamental to the preservation of public confidence in the fairness of the justice system: R vs Collins 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 SCR 265 @ paragraph 36. A fair trial of tax evasion cases is also fundamental to the preservation of public confidence in the fairness of the tax system and its administration.\n[30] Neither a judicial stay of the prosecution nor an order to exclude evidence should be granted if a lesser remedy would suffice to ensure a fair trial: R vs O\u2019Connor [1995] 4 SCR 651 @ pages 465-466; R vs Bjelland 2009 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2009] 2 SCR 651 @ paragraph 19. In this case, a judicial stay of the prosecution is not necessary for that purpose, but an order for exclusion of the evidence seized under the authority of the search warrant is.\nDisposition\n[31] The documents seized under the authority of the search warrant will be excluded from evidence at this trial.\nV. Summary of the BC Court\u2019s Charter breach findings and remedies [89] In summary Judge Gouge found one section 7 breach and two section 8 breaches, as well as a section 11 breach if he allowed the trial to continue and not stay the proceeding. His remedies for the sections 7 and 8 breaches were to exclude evidence from the home and the computers and to exclude evidence from CRA\u2019s second audit.\n[90] In McCartie 2015-2 the BC Court found that CRA\u2019s failures to make notes, and to retain the notes that were made, denied the McCarties the right to a fair trial. A fair hearing is enshrined in section 11 of the Charter. The BC Court also found that the McCarties\u2019 rights under section 7 of the Charter had been breached by CRA\u2019s unacceptably negligent loss of the Coles Notes.[11] The remedy imposed by the BC Court was to exclude from evidence all documents procured by CRA exercising its statutory power as part of the second audit \u2014 i.e. the audit giving rise to the reassessments in dispute in this Court.\n[91] In McCartie 2015-3 and 2015-4 the BC Court found that the failure by the CRA Investigators to comply with section 29(1) of the Criminal Code regarding the production of a copy of a search warrant when asked was a significant breach of section 8 of the Charter regarding unreasonable search or seizure.\n[92] In McCartie 2015-4 the BC Court threw out the search warrant for the search of the McCarties\u2019 home as the ITO could not support the search warrant being issued without the evidence obtained by CRA during the second audit. The resulting warrantless search was another breach of the McCarties\u2019 section 8 Charter rights. The BC Court completed its detailed Grant analysis for both of these section 8 breaches which it described as cumulatively very serious breaches. The section 24 remedy imposed in the BC Court\u2019s proceeding for these two section 8 breaches was to exclude from evidence in that proceeding evidence seized from their home.\nVI. This Voir Dire Proceeding Witness testimony\n[93] Mr. McCartie was the only witness for the appellant in this hearing. As stated above, he only testified to, and was cross-examined on, facts relevant to this stage of the proceeding, and not on the substantive issues applicable to the several penalties assessed under the ITA and GST\/HST provisions, the statute-barred years, or the substantive tax issues.\n[94] The respondent called three witnesses from CRA. The Auditor Ms. Coles, the Auditor Mr. McLachlan to whom the audit file was transferred in 2009, and Mr. Alan Jones, the Team Leader heading Criminal Investigations in Vancouver at the time. Their testimony covered both the evidentiary and procedural aspects of the voir dire, and, as described above, the respondent\u2019s witnesses\u2019 evidence on the substantive merits of the penalties assessed and in dispute in this appeal, along with the substantive tax issues including the statute-barred years. The respondent also called Dr. Angelina Loo, an orthodontist who was one of the persons to whom Mr. McCartie provided services for which he billed and was paid. Virtually all of Dr. Loo\u2019s evidence pertained to the substantive merits of this appeal.\n[95] As noted by Judge Gouge, Mr. McLachlan\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the issues before the BC Court, as he took over the audit in 2009. Similarly, it is of little direct relevance in this voir dire.\n[96] It should also be noted that Mr. Brown, the auditor who completed the earlier audit of the McCarties, transferred to Criminal Investigations, and then returned to Audit from Criminal Investigations to recommend the audits in question leading to the referral to Criminal Investigations, did not testify. As I wrote above with respect to Ms. Sundberg, I will regard Mr. Brown\u2019s evidence in the BC Court and what that court wrote about it, as the most favorable version of events from the respondent\u2019s point of view and from Mr. Brown\u2019s. I also accept Judge Gouge\u2019s assessment of his testimony and I share his doubts about it.\n(i) Mr. McCartie\u2019s evidence [97] Mr. McCartie described the first audit of 2002 and 2003 by Mr. Brown. He noted that Mr. Brown\u2019s penalty report was approved by his Team Leader Mr. Lidster. The McCarties filed objections to the 2002-2003 reassessments, which were largely allowed. Penalties were withdrawn and most of the denied expenses, hundred of thousands of dollars, were allowed by CRA Appeals.\n[98] Mr. McCartie explained that Mr. Brown\u2019s audit led to liens being placed upon their home, even before the reassessments were issued, which in turn led to his bankruptcy.\n[99] Mr. Brown recommended the second audit on November 21, 2007, which is almost immediately upon returning to Audit from Criminal Investigations. Mr. Brown\u2019s T134[12] was accepted by Criminal Investigations for \u201cfull scale\u201d Investigation by Ms. Sundberg.\n[100] During the second audit, at a November 27, 2008 meeting with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar, the McCarties were asked by Mr. Lecznar about their beliefs regarding natural persons and their beliefs about paying income tax. These questions made Mr. McCartie uncomfortable and suspicious of Mr. Lecznar\u2019s motives and purposes for asking such questions as they did not seem consistent with an audit verification of income, expenses, deductions etc., but were about his personal thinking, opinion and belief. He found Mr. Lecznar\u2019s questions were more focussed on an intention to not pay taxes.\n[101] Mr. McCartie said that he and his wife felt compelled to provide some cancelled cheques and invoices (that his wife had partially redacted) at the audit meeting. While asked for, they were also told that they would be compelled by written requirements to if they didn\u2019t provide them. The questionnaire they were asked to fill out also went beyond questions about the records required to be kept under the ITA and GST legislation.\n[102] In December 2008 Ms. Coles and her Team Leader Mr. Lidster met to issue the bank requirements.\n[103] There was a letter to Ms. Coles called a Statement of Facts that purported to be from Mr. McCartie. Mr. McCartie denies sending it, does not know who did, and was unaware of it prior to its production on discovery in the BC Court proceedings. I have no reason at this stage not to believe that, having heard from all of the respondent\u2019s witnesses. If it turns out Mr. McCartie did send it or authorize it to be sent, it would be a voluntary document and there will be no reason for its exclusion on Charter grounds. Its provenance and its relevance can be ultimately determined at the trial stage. For purposes of this voir dire, I accept his explanation.\n[104] Mr. McCartie acknowledged in cross-examination that a Mr. Ho of Paradigm Education attended one of the McCarties\u2019 meetings with Ms. Coles and Mr. Lecznar. Ms. McCartie invited Mr. Ho to observe the meeting and he did not participate. This is not relevant to the Charter issues. Suffice it to say CRA believed both McCarties were de-taxers making natural person claims, and that was based in part on Mr. McCartie having attended some Paradigm seminars, and a Paradigm official attending the one audit meeting as described. In addition, Mr. McCartie signed a $4,800 contract for services to be provided by Mr. Ho or by Paradigm (though Mr. McCartie says it should have only said Mr. Ho) as educator to tutor Mr. McCartie on the Charter and the Bill of Rights. This is one of the documents that were seized by CRA when the McCarties\u2019 home was searched.\n[105] Mr. McCartie testified that Ms. McCartie let Criminal Investigations and RCMP in the house before she left on the day they searched the McCarties\u2019 home. However, Mr. McCartie was not present at that time. He said he wasn\u2019t sure and did not know for certain. Judge Gouge\u2019s decisions do not mention this and it would have been relevant to what he was deciding. I conclude Mr. McCartie is wrong on this point and I accept that Ms. McCartie left the home before the RCMP and CRA chose to enter after she and her daughter left.\n[106] I do have some credibility concerns with Mr. McCartie saying that his tutoring by Mr. Ho was separate from Mr. Ho\u2019s role at Paradigm. I note this even though the courses are not relevant at this stage. I do not have credibility concerns on matters that are relevant at this stage.\n[107] I also have some reliability concerns that on several occasions Mr. McCartie was very categorical and certain about some things that, when presented with evidence to the contrary, he had to acknowledge he should have been less certain about than he had been.\n[108] The issue of Mr. Ho not Paradigm being the tutor under contract as educator is not one that Mr. McCartie would back down from, even when faced with questions from me and in cross-examination asking why his contract with Mr. Ho referred to Paradigm a number of times, and each page of the contract was printed on Paradigm letterhead with Paradigm footers and described their standard payment plans as a percentage of the tax savings.\n(ii) Annette Coles\u2019 evidence [109] Ms. Coles has a CPA designation and is a team leader in Audit at CRA. She had been an auditor in the years in question, having started at CRA as an auditor in 2005. Ms. Coles has never worked in Criminal Investigations.\n[110] Ms. Coles testified that she issued the Requests for Information \u201cRFIs\u201d to the financial institutions since that is the normal step to follow when unable to obtain all of the information from taxpayers directly.\n[111] She had no involvement in the decision to refer the audit file to Criminal Investigations, and no involvement with what was referred to Criminal Investigations or what documents Audit made available to Criminal Investigations.\n[112] Ms. Coles transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan when she was transferred within Audit from General Income Tax Audit to GST Refunds Return Audits. At the time she transferred the file to Mr. McLachlan she had not come to any conclusion regarding the audit as it was still very much in the information gathering stages. She had not used or relied on any banking information and records to come to any decision or conclusion about Mr. McCartie\u2019s income.\n[113] Ms. Coles confirmed that the lost Coles\u2019 Notes would have included her detailed chronology of the steps she took and the events that occurred in the course of the audits she was attending to.\n(iii) Mr. McLachlan\u2019s evidence [114] Mr. McLachlan has been with CRA for over 30 years as an Excise Tax auditor throughout, which included some responsibilities as a generalist in Tax and in GST Audit. He did not complete the CGA program he started in the 1970s.\n[115] Mr. McLachlan confirmed that the audit files were transferred to him in 2009. He said that he can not recall why the McCarties were selected for audit. As part of the McCarties\u2019 audits that he took over from Ms. Coles, he reviewed Mr. Brown\u2019s earlier audit of 2002-2003. He started work on it around June of 2009 a few months after it was transferred to him. He worked about 200 hours on the file before the March 2010 referral by him and his team leader to Criminal Investigations. After completing his review of Ms. Coles\u2019 file at that time, he came to \u201can inconclusive conclusion\u201d as there were many items in the bankruptcy that CRA could not explain. He never contacted or dealt with Mr. McCartie during the audit. He processed the file as transferred to him by Ms. Coles along with any records received from the banks to the RFIs that were received thereafter. He said that he does not particularly recall why the audit was transferred to Criminal Investigations even though he was the person who recommended to his team leader that it be transferred to Criminal Investigations.\n[116] Mr. McLachlan said he does not know what documents were taken from the searching and seizure of his desk. He was working from home at that stage. He said he does not know why his desk was searched. He said this was the only time in his CRA career that he had a search of his desk or anything seized from his files.\n[117] Mr. McLachlan does not recall if the Laurentian and ResMor bank records were received in response to an RFI sent by Ms. Coles. He testified that they could have been seized from Ms. McCartie\u2019s computer at the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. Mr. McLachlan said he did not rely on them as part of his audits. He did not think they were relevant so they did not go in the audit file, but would have remained at his desk awaiting shredding at the completion of the audits but for the seizure. He testified documents received from taxpayers or others that an auditor does not think are relevant (even if a taxpayer does) do not get placed in the audit file but are kept separately \u201con hold\u201d and shredded at the conclusion of the audit. CRA audit procedures required that anything relevant to the assessment in the audit be inserted in the Audit package, and nothing more. The relevance of documents for these purposes is determined by the auditor who may find to be irrelevant documents that are provided by or on behalf of a taxpayer who believes they are relevant. It should have been described in the T-2020. Mr. McLachlan\u2019s working papers and summaries of unreported income, allow for expenses and GST payable on those expenses. They were based entirely on the RFIs and documents received in response to them. His summaries were forwarded to Criminal Investigations along with anything Ms. Coles may have prepared when she worked the file.\n[118] The only expenses Mr. McLachlan allowed in his audit work were those documented by cheques drawn on the CIBC account, and not any that might have been payed otherwise or by cheque on another of the McCarties\u2019 banks to which CRA had issued RFIs. Mr. McLachlan agreed that Mr. McCartie was correct that this was \u201can incomplete audit\u201d and CRA had not accounted for expenses to the full extend audit procedures provided for.\n(iv) Angelina Loo\u2019s evidence [119] Dr. Loo is an orthodontist. She met Mr. McCartie when they both attended the same \u201ccourse\u201d on natural persons. Sometime after that, Dr. Loo hired Mr. McCartie to design her practice\u2019s website for a fixed fee.\n[120] Dr. Loo was later contacted by Ms. Sundberg of Criminal Investigations to obtain copies of the invoice she received for that work along with her cheque by which she paid it. Dr. Loo provided these. Other evidence confirms that these were used by Criminal Investigations in its investigation prior to the assessments in question being issued by Criminal Investigations.\n[121] I see no reason on these facts to consider excluding the documents obtained by CRA from Dr. Loo from being relied on by the respondent in this proceeding.\n(v) Alan Jones\u2019 evidence [122] Mr. Jones is a CPA and has worked at CRA for over 20 years. In the period in question, he was the team leader of Criminal Investigations in Vancouver. He had been in Criminal Investigations since 2002 and was its team leader since 2005. Mr. Jones explained that in about 75% of cases, an investigation starts with a referral from Audit.\n[123] He was the team leader for the McCarties\u2019 audits and Ms. Sundberg was the lead investigator. He would have reviewed all of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s working papers and any reports she would have prepared. He gave Ms. Sundberg guidance on the investigation. He had regular meetings with her regarding the investigation\u2019s direction and progress.\n[124] All six of the senior Investigators reported to him and he oversaw their work and all of their investigations. He was involved in reviewing all of their work including primary reports, ITOs, search warrants, audit reports and prosecution reports. He reviewed everything that came in to Ms. Sundberg\u2019s possession, the whole audit file and all documents from production orders.\n[125] Mr. Jones testified that Audit had only reviewed Mr. McCartie\u2019s 2005 to 2007 years and that, after it was referred to Criminal Investigations, Criminal Investigations expanded their investigation audit to add 2008 and 2009.\n[126] Mr. Jones confirmed that Criminal Investigations had Mr. Brown\u2019s initial audit file of 2002-2003 and reviewed it. It is not entirely clear how, when or why it first came into Criminal Investigations\u2019 possession. He also confirmed that during the period Mr. Brown was in Criminal Investigations, being after he completed the initial audit of the McCarties and before he returned to Audit from Criminal Investigations and recommended the audits in question, Mr. Brown reported to Mr. Jones as his team leader as one of his Investigators.\n[127] Mr. Jones was present at the McCarties\u2019 home for the execution of the search warrant and throughout the search. He said that he does not recall if he was present for the search of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s desk.\n[128] With respect to the search and seizure at the McCarties\u2019 home, Mr. Jones testified that he and his whole Criminal Investigations\u2019 team of six or seven Investigators attended the execution of the search. They were supplemented by some Auditors and perhaps some Collections staff. Mr. Jones did not suggest that Ms. McCartie let the RCMP or the CRA into their home. He is clear that she opened the door and left the premises altogether, and only at that time did their search begin. He confirmed that he knew Ms. McCartie was not given the search warrant when she asked, or at all, but that a copy was left on the McCarties\u2019 dining room table at the end of the day.\n[129] This Court had the benefit of Mr. Jones\u2019 testimony on behalf of the Crown. Mr. Jones did not say he was at anytime unaware of the Criminal Code\u2019s requirement to provide a taxpayer a copy of the search warrant when asked. He did not say that his Criminal Investigations unit Investigators were not appropriately trained on executing search warrants, including that requirement. Mr. Jones did not defend or try to explain away what his two Investigators, Ms. Sundberg and Mr. Stenchman, did and didn\u2019t do when first executing the search warrant prior to the search of the home being conducted. He did not say his Investigators were following RCMP Constable Reynold\u2019s lead. Mr. Jones said that he was unaware of, and did not see or hear, what happened at the door even though he was at the property. I infer from this that, in fact, Mr. Jones and all of his Investigators present at the McCarties\u2019s home were aware of the requirements.\n[130] This testimony, that Judge Gouge did not have, leads me to conclude that the section 8 Charter breach of conducting the search without complying with the Criminal Code requirement that Ms. McCartie be given a copy of the search warrant when she asked for it was more severe and more deliberate, and on the opposite side of the centre line between good faith and bad faith, than Judge Gouge \u201caccepted\u201d in McCartie 2015-4.\n[131] Mr. Jones was clear in his testimony that none of the documents seized from the home assisted Ms. Sundberg with the assessments of tax as the only information used for the tax assessments came from the bank records received from the banks in compliance with the RFIs and production orders issued by CRA to the banks. Documents seized from the home were relied on to assess the penalties and to open the statute-barred years, along with the information from Ms. Sundberg\u2019s interviews with Dr. Loo and other third parties.\nVII. Law and analysis [132] This Court can, if appropriate, impose a section 24 Charter remedy in respect of the identified Charter breaches, including breaches under sections 8 and 11 regarding the BC criminal proceedings.\n[133] This is supported by the wording of section 24 itself. This is also supported by O\u2019Neill Motors Limited, 1998 CanLII 9070 (FCA), Donovan [2000] 4 FC 373, Warawa 2003 TCC 756 (affirmed 2005 FCA 34) and Canada v. Jurchison, 2001 FCA 126.\n[134] Cases such as Romanuk 2013 FCA 133, Piersanti 2014 FCA 243, Bauer 2018 FCA 62, Brooks 2019 TCC 47 (affirmed 2019 FCA 293) and SPE Valeur 2019 TCC 174, holding that a taxpayer cannot complain in the Tax Court of a section 8 or section 11 breach, are cases where no criminal proceeding had occurred in which the breach was raised and the breach determined to have occurred.\n[135] For example, in Warawa J.A. Sharlow was dealing with an appeal from J. Beaubier\u2019s decision in this Court that involved somewhat similar facts to this case. Mr. Warawa had been found in his related criminal proceeding to have had his Charter rights breached leading to the criminal trial not proceeding. Neither Justice Sharlow nor Justice Beaubier\u2019s reasons suggest a section 24 remedy could not be granted in this Court for the section 7 breach.\n[136] It is clear that this Court must reweigh the factors and the appropriate relief, if any, for Charter breaches under section 8 or 11 in a related criminal proceeding.\n[137] The parties do not disagree with this, although the respondent maintains that Mr. McCartie obtained a full remedy in the BC Court and no further remedy is warranted in this civil Tax Court proceeding. At times it did appear that the respondent did want to disagree in oral argument, but resiled when questioned.\n[138] Section 24 of the Charter requires that a Grant-type analysis be conducted. As described by Judge Gouge in McCartie 2015-4 above, a court must conduct a Grant analysis to determine what remedy, if any, is appropriate under section 24 of the Charter in respect of identified Charter breaches. This is required whether or not the breaches occurred in the proceeding considering the remedy. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Reilly 2021 SCC 38 has more recently described the Grant analysis considerations and weighing.\n[139] The parties do not disagree with how Judge Gouge approached and applied the Grant analysis in the BC Court proceedings. While the respondent Crown may not have agreed with the result of Judge Gouge\u2019s application, no appeal was taken.\n[140] The weighing of competing interests in a criminal proceeding for tax evasion may be different than in a civil tax proceeding involving the same circumstances, as regards the quantum of tax, the reopening of statute-barred years, and even the gross negligence penalties for tax offences under the ITA.\nVIII. The Grant Analysis and Conclusions [141] This is not a case in which the Grant analysis is easy or straightforward. Canadians rightly expect fellow taxpayers to pay their taxes and for there to be consequences for those who choose not to. Canadians also rightly expect law enforcement officers executing search warrants or collecting evidence to support an investigation of potential criminal wrongdoing, to be knowledgeable of, and to respect, at least the basic straightforward rules applicable when doing so.\n[142] I agree with Judge Gouge\u2019s considerations, his weighing of the competing considerations, and with the remedy he chose to impose in his court. The question that I must decide is what if any remedy should be imposed in this Tax Court proceeding.\n[143] In conducting the Grant analysis in this Court, I am mindful of the fact that the amounts in dispute in the Court are composed of three separate issues. These are the substantive issues to be ultimately decided in this proceeding:\n1) the amount of tax that should be paid and interest thereon;\n2)whether the statute-barred years are subject to being reopened after the normal reassessment period under the ITA, which requires the respondent show that a taxpayer has made a misrepresentation attributable to carelessness, neglect or wilful default, or has committed fraud; and\n3) the gross negligence penalties and whether the threshold for them applying has been met under the ITA, which requires the respondent show that the taxpayer has made a false statement in a return knowingly (including being wilfully blind) or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[144] With respect to the first issue, the quantum of the taxes owing, I think Canadians\u2019 expectations that their fellow Canadians pay their taxes owing as required by the ITA and HST legislation, weigh much more heavily in this Court and may be less easily displaced by other considerations in proceedings in this Court. I believe that is the case as I weigh the Grant factors in this tax appeal.\n[145] In the circumstances I conclude that the only evidence that the respondent should be precluded from relying on in this Court to establish the amount of tax (income tax, GST or HST) owing by Mr. McCartie is the evidence, if any, first collected from the search and seizure of the McCarties\u2019 home. This is not to suggest such is always or generally expected to be the case in respect of an unlawful search of a home as part of a parallel, related tax evasion proceeding. I find that the particular circumstances of the search of the McCarties\u2019 home in this case, combined with the existence of several other Charter breaches in this case, when weighed appropriately, lead to this being the appropriate section 24 remedy in Mr. McCartie\u2019s case. I also find it appropriate that the respondent\u2019s assumptions of fact when reassessing set out in its reply not have the benefit of being presumed to be correct and to subject the taxpayer to an initial burden to demolish them on a prima facie basis, to the extent that Hickman Motors principle remains.\n[146] A consideration of the Grant factors leads me to a similar conclusion with respect to the issue of the respondent\u2019s ability to maintain its assessments of otherwise statute-barred years, that it has reassessed after the normal assessment period had expired. The ITA allows such reassessments in circumstances where a taxpayer has made a misrepresentation in their tax return due to carelessness or neglect. The tax consequences of such an assessment being permitted to be made is that the taxpayer is assessed for the taxes, and interest thereon, on the amount that they should have reported correctly in their return. Those are the amounts Canadians are expected to pay, and that Canadians expect their fellow Canadians to pay. This weighing of the Grant factors again leads me to the conclusion that only the evidence first collected by the respondent from the search of the McCarties\u2019 home should be excluded in this Tax Court proceeding given the particular circumstances of the search of the McCarties\u2019 home and the existence of the other Charter breaches. The respondent has the burden of proof with respect to reassessing statute-barred years under the ITA or any comparable GST or HST requirement.\n[147] Given the state of the evidence on the voir dire, and in particular the absence of Ms. Sundberg\u2019s testimony, I am not deciding the issue at this time of what evidence, if any, was first obtained during the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. This issue can be dealt with if a dispute arises as this tax appeal moves forward.\n[148] Although the audit of Mr. McCartie\u2019s 2008 and 2009 years was initiated by Criminal Investigations, I do not think that, on the facts in question in this case and weighing the Grant considerations, it would be an appropriate remedy to allow Mr. McCartie\u2019s appeal of those two years.\n[149] Miss Sundberg, her Team Leader Mr. Jones, and all of their colleagues who prepared for and attended the search of the McCarties\u2019 home, failed to properly execute the search. The same is true of Corporal Reynolds and perhaps his RCMP colleague in attendance. While I defer to Judge Gouge who heard testimony from Ms. Sundberg and Corporal Reynolds as regards these two not intentionally failing to comply with the requirements to properly execute a search warrant, or threatening to break down a door instead of providing a copy of the search warrant when asked as required, I have great difficulty believing the entire Criminal Investigation\u2019s unit in Vancouver, including its Team Leader Mr. Jones, could have been unaware of such a requirement and prepared the Criminal Investigation\u2019s unit accordingly for this attendance and for execution of search warrants generally. While I did not hear from Ms. Sundberg or Sergent Corporal Reynolds, I did hear from Mr. Jones.\n[150] Penalties under the ITA and GST\/HST legislation are penalties, intended to punish Canadians for their choice to not comply with the statutory requirements of our tax legislation intentionally or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence. They clearly do not engage sections 8 and 11 of the Charter, and therefore civil penalty proceedings under our tax legislation can not, on their own, result in breaches of those two Charter sections, resulting in a remedy therefor under section 24. However, this is not such a case. In Mr. McCartie\u2019s case the BC Court has properly found these two sections of the Charter were breached. Judge Gouge imposed a section 24 remedy in the BC Court proceeding. The question in this Court is whether any further section 24 remedies are appropriate in this Court for all of the Charter breaches against Mr. McCartie found by the BC Court to have occurred \u2014 including sections 8 and 11. That requires a separate weighing of the Grant factors by this Court in respect of the civil penalties than in respect of the quantum of tax and reassessing after normal reassessment period.\n[151] While I agree with Judge Gouge\u2019s Grant analysis, he found that Ms. Sundberg and the RCMP actions were unintentional and bona fides. I accept that. However, I believe that Canadian taxpayers might strongly doubt that as they reasonably expect CRA\u2019s law enforcement officers and RCMP officers executing search warrants, especially on an individual\u2019s home, to be familiar with the basic aspects of execution and to be properly trained in such matters. I base this on decades of experience in dealing with Canadian taxpayers of all sorts from across this country\u2014French, English and those Canadians who need the use of translators in other languages, from those Canadians who only access social benefits from CRA, employees who receive paycheques, small and medium businesses and their owners, through to Canada\u2019s major financial institutions, big pharma and Canadians who own them and who are prosperous. I would expect the majority of Canadian taxpayers, if asked, would make it very clear that they would have trouble accepting that CRA Criminal Investigators executing search warrants were unaware of taxpayers\u2019 rights to a copy of the search warrant as required by the Criminal Code provision authorizing search warrants. It would bring the Canadian judicial system including this Court, and including CRA\u2019s administration and enforcement of the ITA, into disrepute to think that, even if not done in bad faith, CRA\u2019s officials and RCMP enforcing search warrants are not appropriately trained on such a basic and necessary right of all Canadians to fundamentally coexist and together fund the operation of this country and distribute its social programs and its fiscal and economic programs.\n[152] All Canadians challenging a CRA decision must engage with CRA. An objection to CRA is required before taxpayers can appeal to this Court. Many Canadians do go on to initiate proceedings in this Court. The Tax Court deals with alleged detaxers\u2019 tax and penalty obligations very often, relatively consistently and effectively, and in published decisions. The Federal Court of Appeal does so as well. Canadians know this. Similarly, CRA appears readily able to identify and pursue alleged detaxers in accordance with the ITA and the Criminal Code without breaching taxpayers\u2019 Charter rights. I do not believe this will be eroded in any material way if this Court finds that Mr. McCartie is entitled to a remedy in this Court as a result of the breaches of his and his family\u2019s Charter rights by CRA and the RCMP assisting it.\n[153] On the other hand, it is not often that a taxpayer brings to the attention of this Court, and has very convincing evidence to show, that CRA investigators blatantly breached their Charter rights on multiple occasions in this pursuit, even when searching their homes with the RCMP at CRA\u2019s side, and despite a clear and straightforward provision of the Criminal Code\u2019s warrant provisions. In such circumstances, confronted with this, I believe it is necessary that I recognize the importance that this Court clearly impose consequences in the form of section 24 remedies to avoid Canadians losing faith in their Canadian justice system\u2019s commitment and obligation to ensure that our shared tax burden is both lawfully shared by taxpayers, and lawfully administered and collected by our revenue authorities in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation and all other applicable law. This can be expected to help keep cases such as this rare and exceptional.\n[154] Transfers of CRA staff between Audit and Investigations are understandable. However, Canadians might expect there to be an ethical wall to prevent Investigators being involved in investigations into taxpayers they had previously been involved with in Audit or any other department, and certainly to prevent Auditors who had been in Investigations from initiating an audit or taking audit measures in respect of taxpayers they had previously investigated or had previously audited before being in Investigations. This case demonstrates how this can erode the Canadian public\u2019s confidence in CRA and law enforcement, and the public\u2019s credibility of the testimony in our courts of law enforcement officers. This would be particularly problematic in our taxation system which is built and dependent upon a self-assessment regime.\n[155] I find that the appropriate section 24 remedy in this Court with respect to income tax, GST and HST penalties is that the respondent not be allowed to rely on any evidence collected from the second audit or collected from the search of the McCarties\u2019 home. These are the same such remedies as Judge Gouge determined to be appropriate with respect to the penal proceedings.\n[156] I am satisfied that these remedies under section 24 of the Charter constitute the satisfactory and appropriate remedies in respect of the events complained of that were related to, and gave rise to, the Charter breaches, without the need to consider the Canadian Bill of Rights due process right to the enjoyment of property and its right to the principles of fundamental justice, or to the principles of procedural fairness in Canadian courts.\n[157] The Appellant is entitled to costs on this hearing.\n[158] The parties shall have 30 days from the date hereof to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the parties shall have a further 30 days to file written submissions on costs. Each party will have a further 15 days thereafter to file any responding submissions. Any such submissions shall not exceed 15 pages in length initially, and 10 pages for responding submissions. If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received from the appellant, costs shall be awarded in the amount set out in the Tariff to the Rules of the Tax Court of Canada (General Procedure).\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of February 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 16\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2016-2716(IT)G , 2016-2717(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCOLIN MCCARTIE AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nVancouver, British Columbia\nDATE OF HEARING:\nSeptember 20 to 23, 2021 and October 13 to 15, 2021\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Patrick Boyle\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 6, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nFor the Appellant:\nThe Appellant himself\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nEric Brown\nJamie Hansen\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nFran\u00e7ois Daigle Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\nAPPENDIX A - McCartie 2015-1\nBACKGROUND\n[1] This prosecution has a long and complex procedural history. For detailed summary, the reader may refer to a decision which I rendered on May 29, 2014: R vs McCartie 2014 BCPC 128; [2014] BCJ #1227. In brief:\na. Mr. & Ms. McCartie are charged with tax evasion.\nb. Some of the evidence which the Crown proposes to tender against them was obtained by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) from Mr.& Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers under the Income Tax Act. Crown counsel inform me that that evidence is crucial to the Crown\u2019s case.\nc. Relying on R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757, Mr. and Ms. McCartie seek to exclude that evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained from them by compelled disclosure under CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers at a time when the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s enquiries was to obtain evidence for use in a criminal prosecution. In order to rule on that issue, it would be necessary for me to determine the date upon which the predominant purpose of CRA\u2019s enquiries changed from a civil audit to a criminal investigation (\u201cthe Key Date\u201d).\nd. The first CRA audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie was conducted by Mr. Brown, in 2004 \u2013 2005. After he issued his audit report, Ms. Karen Etches of CRA\u2019s Investigations Department asked to meet with Mr. Brown to discuss the audit. The sole function of the Investigations Department is to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Brown met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, another member of the Investigations Department. No decision to prosecute was taken at that time. However, Mr. Brown recommended a second audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Ms. Annette Coles was assigned to conduct that audit. In the course of that duty, Ms. Coles exercised CRA\u2019s statutory power to compel Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers to disclose the documents in question.\ne. Ms. Coles\u2019 practice was to make detailed notes of her meetings with other CRA staff. She believes that she followed that practice in this case. It is reasonable to think that her notes might shed light on the intentions and purposes of other CRA staff with whom she met during the course of her audit, and so might assist in determining the Key Date. However, her notes have been lost.\nf. Mr. Gibson, who was Crown counsel at an early stage of this prosecution, informed Mr. & Ms. McCartie by letter that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes appear to have been lost as a result of a computer malfunction, and that no further information on that subject is available.\ng. Mr. & Ms. McCartie submit that the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes impairs their ability to establish the Key Date (the onus of proof of which lies upon them)[13], and so impairs their ability to make full answer and defence. They seek a judicial stay of proceedings, relying on Regina vs La 1997 CanLII 309 (SCC), [1997] 2 SCR 680. In considering that issue, I must decide whether it should be inferred that Ms. Coles\u2019 notes were lost as a result of \u201c\u2026 an unacceptable degree of negligent conduct \u2026.\u201d on the part of CRA: R vs La @ paragraph 22. The very brief statement in Mr. Gibson\u2019s letter is insufficient to allow me to decide that question.\nh. Mr. Preshaw, who succeeded Mr. Gibson as Crown counsel, undertook to call any Crown witnesses whom the court considers to be necessary on this issue. I am obliged to decide whether the Crown must call Mr. Gibson to identify his sources of information and to elaborate upon the statement in his letter.\nAPPENDIX B - McCartie 2015-2\nTHE ISSUE\n[1] Mr. & Ms. McCartie are charged with tax evasion. On this application, they seek a judicial stay of the prosecution, on the ground that, in the circumstances prevailing, it is not possible to provide them with a fair trial, to which they are entitled by section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms.\n[2] The following are the pertinent circumstances:\na. The Crown\u2019s case depends upon certain documents procured by Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) from Mr. & Ms. McCartie and their bankers by the exercise of CRA\u2019s statutory audit powers.\nb. Mr. & Ms. McCartie assert that, at the time that the statutory audit powers were exercised, CRA\u2019s primary objective was to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. If that assertion is proven, the documents in question ought to be excluded from evidence: R vs Jarvis 2002 SCC 73 (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 757.\nc. Mr. & Ms. McCartie carry the onus of proving the motives and intentions of certain members of CRA\u2019s staff.[14] They can discharge that onus only by successful cross-examinations of those individuals.\nc. Ms. Coles, the CRA auditor who exercised CRA\u2019s statutory powers to procure the documents, made notes of her meetings with other CRA staff and with Mr. & Ms. McCartie. Those notes might shed light on the motives and intentions of other CRA staff at relevant times. The notes have been lost.\nd. Other CRA staff did not make notes of certain key meetings. If they had, the notes might shed light on the motives and intentions of those who attended the meetings.\n[3] The questions are whether the loss of Ms. Coles\u2019 notes and the omission by other CRA staff to make notes materially affect the fairness of the trial and, if so, what remedy ought to be granted.\nTHE EVIDENCE THUS FAR\n[4] Two separate CRA departments were involved in the matter: (i) the Audit Department, which conducts audits to determine the civil liability of taxpayers; and (ii) the Investigations Department, which conducts criminal investigations of tax evasion and directs prosecutions for such offences. The Investigations Department was formerly known as the Enforcement Department.\n[5] In July, 2004, Mr. Jason Brown was working as an auditor in the Audit Department. He was assigned to audit the tax returns of Mr. & Ms. McCartie for the years 2002 and 2003. He disallowed certain business expenses which they had deducted from gross income and issued a notice of re-assessment. He also imposed penalties under section 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, which provides:\n\u2026\nWhen Mr. Brown imposed the penalty, he prepared a penalty report for inclusion in the Audit Department file.\n[6] In his oral evidence, Mr. Brown denied that he suspected Mr. or Ms. McCartie of fraud or tax evasion. However, three passages in his penalty report cast some doubt on his evidence.\na. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nThe taxpayers\u2019 records were inadequate for income tax purposes. Furthermore, some of the expense receipts were not even incurred by the taxpayer.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr. Brown characterized that statement as an assumption, rather than an assertion. The document does not support that characterization.\n(Emphasis added)\nb. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlong with the egregious amounts of personal expenses being deducted, there were many other problems with the records. Some of the cash expenses were already recorded.\nIn answer to Mr. McCartie\u2019s question during cross-examination, Mr. Brown confirmed that this passage was intended to convey Mr. Brown\u2019s suspicion that Mr. & Ms. McCartie had double-reported, or claimed twice, certain expenses.\nc. In his report, Mr. Brown said:\nAlso, the taxpayer deducted two receipts from the same restaurant bill.\n[7] Mr. Brown completed his audit in March 2005. About two months later, he was approached by Ms. Etches, who was then the Assistant Director of the Investigations Department. Ms. Etches asked Mr. Brown to meet with her to discuss Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s file. Mr. Brown believes that it is the practice of the Investigations Department to review all penalty reports, and that it was his penalty report which brought Mr. & Ms. McCartie to Ms. Etches\u2019 attention. Mr. Brown met with Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan, another staff member in the Investigations Department. In his oral evidence, Mr. Brown described the meeting in the following terms:\n\u2026 [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] were asking me questions about possibly conducting an investigation and I told them that this is mostly just personal expenses and unsupported expenses, and I don\u2019t think that this would warrant a -- a full-on investigation. I just felt that it was just a -- that [Mr. & Ms. McCartie] were just negligent.\n* * *\nAnd then [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] said okay, and I guess they decided not to go forth with it.\n* * *\n\u2026 [Ms. Etches and Mr. Chan] said right there in the -- in the interview, they said \u201cOkay, well, we really thought it was just a bigger issue than it really is\u201d.\n[8] No documentary record of the meeting has been disclosed, and it may be that none ever existed.\n[9] Mr. Brown was transferred to the Enforcement Department for the period from February to September, 2007. He returned to work in the Audit Department in September or October, 2007.\n[10] In November, 2007, Mr. Brown completed and submitted a document, on CRA Form T-133, entitled \u201cTax Lead or Project Information\u201d, the purpose of which was to recommend a further audit of Ms. & Mr. McCartie, in relation to their tax returns for the years 2005 - 2006. In that document, Mr. Brown said:\nGeodiscovery Interactive Inc is owned by Annie McCartie although day-to-day operations are performed by Annie\u2019s spouse, Colin.\nAnnie and Colin reported a total income of $28,035 from April 2005 to December 31, 2006. However, according to income and expense statements provided to trustee, they have personal expenditures of between $4000 and $5000 per month, or between $84,000 and $105,000 from April, 2005 to December 31, 2006.\nThe only known source of revenue is Annie\u2019s company, Geodiscovery Interactive Inc in 2006. Geodiscovery reported $145,000 in subcontracts on gross sales of $165,000, and no T4A\u2019s issued. Was this $145,000 paid to Colin? Between Colin and Annie, they only reported gross income of $1635 in 2006.\nColin and Annie were previously audited and reassessed for a large amount of expenses that were deducted. In 2004, Colin declared bankruptcy and was absolved of his tax debt.\nIn June, 2007 (outside audit period) the McCarties sold their house for $365,000 and purchased a new house for $540,000. Where\u2019s all this money coming from?\nPossible net worth.\n[11] As a result of that document, Mr. Ian Chabot, an auditor in the Audit Department, was assigned to conduct an audit of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s tax returns for the years 2005 \u2013 2007. Mr. Chabot fell ill before making any significant progress in the audit, and Ms. Annette Coles was assigned to replace him.\n[12] Ms. Coles, accompanied by another CRA auditor, Mr. Lecznar, met with Mr. & Ms. McCartie in November, 2008. As a result of information provided by Mr. & Ms. McCartie at that meeting, Ms. Coles exercised CRA\u2019s statutory powers to require Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bankers to produce to her copies of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s bank records. The bankers provided her with the copies demanded, as they were obliged to do. Mr. Gibson, who was Crown counsel at the inception of this prosecution, informed me that those documents are essential to the Crown\u2019s case. Statutory demands were issued to the banks in December, 2008 and the documents were provided to CRA in January \u2013 February, 2009.\n[13] Ms. Coles was re-assigned in or about March, 2009, and was replaced as the auditor of Mr. & Ms. McCartie\u2019s returns by Mr. McLachlan. Mr. McLachlan reviewed the bank documents, and formed the conclusion that they would support a prosecution for tax evasion. He made that recommendation, which was accepted. On the basis of that recommendation, the Investigations Department launched a criminal investigation, obtained a search warrant and seized Mr. McLachlan\u2019s file (which contained the bank records). This prosecution ensued.\n[1] In McCartie v. HMQ, 2018 TCC 185, Justice Bocock decided at the first phase of a Rule 58 motion that these issues were best left to the trial judge.\n[2] It would have been preferable had the parties communicated their agreement to the Court in advance so that the measures in place regarding Ms. Sundberg\u2019s evasion and non\u2011appearance for that morning could have been stepped down.\n[3] Judge Gouge had read the tax lead documents and would have been fully aware of their date and contexts, and perhaps their identity. Informer privilege precluded the McCarties having this information.\n[4] The possibility of amicus curiae was also considered, but was found to be precluded by valid precedent.\n[5] Note Mr. Brown omits that those reassessments had been largely vacated on objection to CRA Appeals.\n[6] This is separate and distinct from Mr. Brown's T-133 Tax Lead.\n[7] The term voir dire hearing is used by me to identify the BC Court\u2019s voir dires and related procedural applications, separate from the trial days upon which some of the evidence is drawn by Judge Gouge.\n[8] Note Ms. Sundberg knew that crossing the threshold would constitute executing the warrant.\n[9] It is important to note that Judge Gouge appears to be misremembering or somewhat inexact in his paragraph 5 regarding his earlier decision in McCartie 2015-2. This is perhaps understandable given the complex, lengthy and circuitous nature of the proceedings. It is clear that, prior to addressing the Trial Fairness aspects in McCartie 2015 -2, Judge Gouge concludes (paragraphs 12, 47-48) that \"there has been a breach of Mr. and Ms. McCartie's right under section 7 of the Charter\" by virtue of the Coles Notes having been \"lost deliberately or by unacceptable negligence\" on the part of CRA. Section 7 is the right to fundamental justice. This finding of a Charter breach was a precursor to his Trial Fairness and Remedy analyses. Judge Gouge also refers to and considers the Coles Notes and any other lost notes in his paragraphs 63, 65 and 66 under his Remedy section that results in the exclusion from evidence of the documents procured by CRA in the 2005\u20112007 second audit.\n[10] There appears to be no reported decision. I was not told by either party if Judge Gouge gave reasons, much less what his reasons were. Judge Gouge's wording describes it here as resulting from the Crown's concession, and not just from Judge Gouge's order excluding from evidence the documents procured by CRA in the second audit. It can be noted that Judge Gouge and the Crown had information not disclosed to the McCarties or to me from their in camera hearing regarding the Key Date.\n[11] See paragraphs 47-48\n[12] Referral to Criminal Investigations-Tab 16 Appellant's Book of Documents\n[13] Note that elsewhere, and in later decisions, Judge Gouge is clear he has not decided the issue of who bears the onus regarding when CRA's predominant purpose changed from a civil audit to a criminal investigation. See especially McCartie 2013-1, 2013-2.\n[14] see footnote 13, (immediately preceding footnote) Supra\n",

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 17\nDate: 20240207\nDocket: 2022-2644(GST)I\nBETWEEN:\nKEYVAN AHMADI,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Keyvan Ahmadi, appeals the denial by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) of his application for a GST\/HST New Housing Rebate under the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cETA\u201d) with respect to a property he purchased in Toronto in 2010 (the \u201cRebate Property\u201d).\n[2] Parliament has imposed several conditions for that rebate, one of which is in paragraph 254(2)(b) of the ETA (emphasis added):\n254(2) Where\n\u2026\n(b) at the time the particular individual becomes liable or assumes liability under an agreement of purchase and sale of the complex or unit entered into between the builder and the particular individual, the particular individual is acquiring the complex or unit for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual, \u2026\n[3] In the Reply, the Crown pleaded that the Minister made the following assumptions of fact in denying the GST\/HST New Housing Rebate to the Appellant (emphasis added):\n(a) the Appellant signed an agreement of purchase and sale with a builder on December 1, 2010, with respect to the Rebate Property;\n(b) the purchase price of the Rebate Property was $415,046.10, exclusive of GST\/HST;\n(c) the Appellant took possession of the Rebate Property on September 19, 2014;\n(d) the Rebate Property was listed for sale and sold to a third party in December of 2014 for a purchase price of $448,000;\n(e) at the time the Rebate Property was purchased, the Appellant did not intend that either he or a qualified relation of the Appellant would occupy the Rebate Property as a primary place of residence;\n(f) the Appellant reported no employment income for the years between when the Rebate Property was purchased in 2010 to when the appellant moved into the Rebate Property in 2014; and\n(g) in December of 2014, the Appellant moved from the Rebate Property to his parents\u2019 house located at 539 Elgin Mills Road West, Richmond Hill ON, L4C 4M3.\n[4] The Crown was the only party to produce any documents at the hearing. The Crown\u2019s documents included:\nExhibit R-1: Mortgage agreement dated October 28, 2014 signed by the Appellant for a loan of $354,240 payable monthly at a 4.25% fixed interest rate for a year ($1,734.95\/month).\nExhibit R-2: Statement of adjustments dated September 19, 2014 indicating a purchase price of $442,800 and that the purchasers were Keyvan Ahmadi and Peyman Ahmadi.\nExhibit R-3: Income tax return information for the 2010 taxation year indicating the Appellant\u2019s total reported income of $14,426.\nExhibit R-4: Income tax return information for the 2014 taxation year indicating the Appellant\u2019s total income of $3,968.\n[5] This appeal turns on whether the Appellant adduced sufficient evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he intended to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence when he entered into the agreement of purchase and sale in 2010. Notwithstanding his oral assertion that intended to do so, I conclude that the Appellant\u2019s evidence falls short of the mark for the following reasons:\nThe Appellant would not have been able to afford the annual mortgage payment of $20,820 on a reported income of less than $15,000 in 2010;\nIn response to that concern, the Appellant explained that his actual 2010 income exceeded the amount of income reported for that year as he did not disclose his cash income on that return. The Court was not reassured by this explanation. On the contrary, it only diminished the Appellant\u2019s credibility;\nThe Appellant\u2019s testimony that his parents helped him purchase the Rebate Property was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal in which he alleged that his partner at the time helped him purchase the Rebate Property;\nThe Appellant\u2019s testimony that his parents no longer helped him with the ongoing expenses of the Rebate Property after they separated was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal in which he alleged that his partner no longer helped him with the ongoing expenses of the Rebate Property after they broke up;\nAlthough the mortgage document does not bear his brother\u2019s signature, the Appellant maintained that his brother co-signed the mortgage;\nThe Appellant became evasive when asked to identify his own signature on the mortgage document admitting only that it might have been a \u201cpartial signature\u201d; and\nThe Appellant could not recall when he moved into the Rebate Property \u2212 not even which season it was at the time.\n[6] In summary, the Appellant\u2019s evidence about his intention to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence lacked credibility and was at odds with his own Notice of Appeal. In such circumstances, it is significant that the Appellant\u2019s evidence was unsupported by documentary evidence or evidence from a third party. The Appellant has simply failed to prove sufficient facts to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he intended to use the Rebate Property as his primary place of residence when he entered into the agreement of purchase and sale. His appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 18\nDate: 20240214\nDocket: 2016-2036(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nEDWARD DEMCHYNSKI,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\n[1] Using the net worth method, the Minister assessed the Appellant for failing to report substantial income on his income tax returns for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years. He was also assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).\n[2] The Appellant; his spouse, Shannon Demchynski; and the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) auditor, Joanne Douglas, who conducted the audit of the Appellant, testified during the hearing.\n[3] I found Ms. Douglas to be a credible witness. I did not find either the Appellant or Mrs. Demchynski to be a credible witness.\n[4] Mrs. Demchynski briefly testified with respect to her family\u2019s lifestyle. As I will discuss, this testimony was shown on cross-examination to be misleading.\n[5] I found the Appellant not to be forthcoming with respect to his contracting business and his family\u2019s lifestyle. He was very evasive during cross-examination with respect to these two topics.\n[6] Under cross-examination, he either could not recall damaging testimony that he provided under oath during his examination for discovery or directly contradicted such damaging testimony.\n[7] In many instances, the objective evidence before me contradicted the Appellant\u2019s testimony. This included his testimony with respect to his hours worked for his employer, his primary source of income, the nature of his contracting business and his family\u2019s lifestyle. He was not a credible witness.\nThe Appellant\u2019s sources of income\n[8] The Appellant testified that he worked full time for the town of The Pas at a hockey rink cleaning the ice surface. In the summertime, he cut grass for the town. He testified that he carried on a \u201cside\u201d endeavour or business of performing carpentry work and \u201chome repairs and stuff for people.\u201d He noted that he carried on the business on his days off from his job with the town and on weekends when he could.\n[9] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony on his sources of income. In my view, it was an attempt to downplay his principal source of income, namely, the carrying on of a business as a contractor. His testimony that he carried on a part\u2011time business of performing carpentry work and home repairs was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court. His testimony on this point seriously damaged his credibility.\n[10] In an attempt to support the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he worked full time for the town of The Pas, the Appellant\u2019s counsel asked the Appellant the following leading questions with respect to a pay stub of the Appellant that the Appellant filed as Exhibit A-72:\nQ Okay. I want you to go to Volume 7, Tab 72, please.\nA Okay.\nQ So I \u2013 I\u2019m just going to talk you through it. I think we can all read this. Is \u2013 this is a pay stub?\nA Yes, it is.\nQ And this \u2013 and it says \u2013 it\u2019s dated, basically, end of December 23, and it\u2019s got year to date. So is it fair to say this would be the \u2013 the last pay stub for the \u2013 for the year for 2011?\nA Yes, it would be.\nQ Okay. And are the \u2013 do these numbers look accurate?\nA I would say so.\nQ So \u2013 and just on the bottom, sir, it says 2,155.27. So for the Town of The Pas \u2013 by the way, does this pay stub reflect what you just told the Court? This is Zamboni and cutting grass, et cetera?\nA Yes, it would be.\nQ Okay. And at the bottom, it says two-thousand-one-five-five-point-two-seven. Did you work almost 2200 hours for the Town of The Pas that year?\nA Yes, I would have. I worked full-time.\n[11] The issue with counsel\u2019s questions and the Appellant\u2019s answers is that the 2,155.27 referred to by counsel does not represent the hours that the Appellant worked in 2011 but rather represents his gross pay of $2,155.27 for the two-week pay period ending on December 23, 2011.\n[12] An estimate of the hours that he worked can be determined from the pay stub. The first line of numbers under the title \u201cEarnings\u201d shows year-to-date regular employment income of $31,598.19 at a rate of $21.51 per hour. The Appellant testified that the town paid him roughly the same hourly rate throughout the year. This means that he worked 1,469 regular hours during the 2011 year.\n[13] His total compensation from the town of The Pas was lower in 2009 and 2010.\n[14] This evidences that his job for the town of The Pas was more of a part-time or seasonal job. Since he worked at a hockey rink, I assume that the Appellant\u2019s job with the town of The Pas was a seasonal job that he worked mainly during the hockey season.\n[15] The Appellant provided limited evidence with respect to his contracting business. Exhibit A-57 contains invoices that the Appellant issued in respect of his contracting business. The invoices are identified as quotations; however, the Appellant testified that these were actually the invoices that he issued to customers.\n[16] The Appellant provided all of these invoices, except for an invoice for $45,000 issued in August 2010,[1] to Ms. Douglas during the audit.\n[17] Exhibits A-14, A-17 and A-22 summarize the invoices provided to Ms. Douglas. The invoices, plus the invoice at Exhibit R-61, evidence that the Appellant had gross income (including any GST that he charged) from his contracting business of at least $250,559 in 2009, $451,356 in 2010 and $209,692 in 2011. However, the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued in respect of the Appellant\u2019s contracting business.\n[18] It can be seen from the summaries and the actual invoices that each of the invoices has a quotation\/invoice number. These numbers evidence that the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued by the Appellant. For example, for the 2009 taxation year, the Court was only provided with 8 of the 34 invoices issued with quotation\/invoice numbers between 108151 and 108185.[2] The summary at Exhibit A-17 evidences that the Court was only provided with 4 of the 12 invoices issued in the 2010 taxation year with quotation\/invoice numbers between 108186 and 108198. The summary at Exhibit A-22 evidences that the Court was provided with 12 invoices in respect of the 2011 taxation year. Exhibit A-22 shows that the Appellant used two sets of invoices in 2011. One set consisted of invoices that were numbered between 186159 and 186191. The second set consisted of invoices that were numbered between 254108 and 254128. Clearly, the Court was not provided with all of the invoices issued in 2011.\n[19] This factual finding is supported by Ms. Douglas\u2019s analysis of amounts deposited into the Appellant\u2019s bank accounts. For each of the years at issue, Ms. Douglas reviewed the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and credit card statements to determine the amount of deposits that the Appellant made into each of these accounts. She then deducted what she could identify as \u201cnon-business income deposits\u201d such as interest, bank charges, child tax benefits, transfers between accounts, the Appellant\u2019s income from employment, Mrs. Demchynski\u2019s income from employment, income tax refunds, and merchandise returns. The result was assumed to be deposits from business receipts.[3]\n[20] Using this method, Ms. Douglas estimated that the Appellant received gross business income (including any GST that he charged) of $352,590 in 2009, $614,050.99 in 2010 and $327,325.07 in 2011. Over the three years, this equals $1,293,966.06 of gross business income. The $1,293,966.06 exceeds the $911,607 of gross business income shown on the invoices provided by the Appellant by $382,359.06. This constitutes additional evidence that the Appellant did not provide the Court with copies of all of the invoices that he issued to customers during the relevant years.\n[21] The Appellant testified that his clients included insurance companies and individual homeowners. His work for one insurance company included building a home that had been damaged by a fire.\n[22] The Appellant testified that he only charged GST on the invoices issued to the insurance companies. He did not charge GST on the invoices issued to the individual homeowners. The insurance companies informed him that his invoices had to include GST.\n[23] The Appellant did not remit any of the GST that he collected from the insurance companies. At some point, he pleaded guilty to a criminal offence for failing to remit GST.\n[24] The Appellant testified that he had a quote book that contained the quotes (invoices) for each job and the receipts for expenses incurred to complete the job. He did not provide the quote books to the CRA or file them as evidence with the Court. The Appellant testified that he \u201cthrew\u201d the quote books out before the CRA began to audit the relevant years. The audit began on January 2, 2013, only 8 months after he filed his tax return for the 2011 taxation year. Under subsection 230(4), the Appellant was required to keep for six years all records and books of account for each of his taxation years, together with every account and voucher necessary to verify the information contained in his records and books. The Appellant did not comply with this provision.\n[25] The evidence before me leads to a factual finding that that Appellant carried on a substantial contracting business during each of the relevant taxation years. Further, the dates on the invoices provided to the Court indicate that the business was carried on throughout each year.\n[26] On the basis of the evidence before the Court, I have concluded that the Appellant carried on a full-time business of acting as a contractor and was employed on a part-time\/seasonal basis to clean the ice at the hockey rink and mow lawns.\n[27] The Appellant had two other sources of income. One was rental income in 2010 and 2011 from two rental properties that he constructed in 2009 and 2010. I will discuss each of these properties when discussing the net worth calculation.\n[28] The other source of income was from the sale of land in 2010. In 2003, the Appellant purchased 39 acres of land for $50,000. He subsequently subdivided the land into a number of lots. The Appellant built a family home on one of the lots, gifted some of the lots to family members and sold the remaining lots to third parties.\n[29] In 2005, he sold four of the lots to third parties for consideration of $74,000. He sold one lot in 2007 for consideration of $22,000 and one lot in 2008 for consideration of $10,000. In 2010, he sold two lots for consideration of $48,000.\nIncome reported on Appellant\u2019s income tax returns\n[30] In his tax return for 2009, the Appellant reported employment income of $28,217.75, gross business income of $45,180 and a loss from this business of $651.[4]\n[31] In his tax return for 2010, the Appellant reported employment income of $31,813.76, net rental income of $13,810, gross business income of $45,814 and a loss from this business of $1,291.58.[5]\n[32] In his tax return for 2011, the Appellant reported employment income of $49,593.14, net rental income of $10,312.21, gross business income of $54,255.80 and a loss from this business of $12,324.19.[6]\nCRA\u2019s determination of the Appellant\u2019s income\n[33] As I noted in Berezuik v. The Queen, 2010 TCC 296, at paragraph 16:\n\u2026 The net worth analysis is a method of last resort. The method should only be used where, due to a lack of reliable records, approaches that are more conventional cannot be used. However, as this Court has noted on numerous occasions, it is open to the Minister under subsection 152(7) to use the net worth method whenever he considers it appropriate. It is not the role of this Court to question the use of the net worth method by the Minister to assess the Appellants; rather I must, based upon the evidence before me, determine the correctness of the assessments at issue.\n[34] Ms. Douglas noted that the audit of the Appellant occurred because of a lead obtained from a CRA collector who was doing field work in the town of The Pas. The collector obtained information that the Appellant was working for cash and not reporting income from his contracting business, the sale of lots or the rental properties.\n[35] Ms. Douglas explained why she used the net worth method to determine the Appellant\u2019s income.\n[36] After her initial meetings with the Appellant and his spouse, she determined that the Appellant had no books and records for his contracting business. There was no ledger to show revenue accounts or expenses. She had no records to verify.\n[37] The only information that the Appellant provided to Ms. Douglas was a grocery bag full of receipts for 2011. He provided no receipts for 2009 or 2010.\n[38] Ms. Douglas, after being informed by the Appellant that his gross income was around $54,000, quickly reviewed the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and noticed that bank deposits far exceeded the $54,000. As discussed previously, deposits were well in excess of $1 million over the three-year period.\n[39] This is a classic situation where the CRA, on account of the lack of books and records and the unexplained deposits that appeared on the taxpayer\u2019s bank statements, was forced to use the net worth method to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income. This was the only method available to Ms. Douglas to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income.\n[40] Ms. Douglas performed a fairly standard net worth calculation for the Appellant. The components of the calculation are as follows:\n-First, she determined the Appellant\u2019s total assets as at December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Ms. Douglas divided the assets into two groups: business assets and personal assets.\n-She then determined the Appellant\u2019s total liabilities at the end of each of the years. The liabilities were divided into business liabilities and personal liabilities.\n-The increase or decrease in the Appellant\u2019s net worth was then calculated.\n-Ms. Douglas then made a number of positive adjustments to the calculated increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth for each year. The most significant positive adjustment was the addition of substantial personal expenditures.\n-Next, Ms. Douglas made negative adjustments to the calculated amount in respect of income tax refunds and child tax benefits.\n-Ms. Douglas then compared the number arrived at after making the adjustments to the income reported by the Appellant and his spouse on their income tax returns. The difference was treated as unreported business income.\n-Ms. Douglas\u2019s final step was to reduce the calculated unreported business income to take into account the fact that the two rental properties shown on the assets schedule for the Appellant had been double counted. I will discuss this double counting shortly.\n[41] After removing the double counting of the rental properties, Ms. Douglas concluded, on the basis of the net worth analysis, that the Appellant had understated his business income in each of the relevant taxation years as follows:\n- 2009 taxation year \u2013 $311,509\n- 2010 taxation year \u2013 $440,216\n- 2011 taxation year \u2013 $142,184\n[42] The Respondent notes in his Reply that on account of a processing error, the Appellant was only assessed to increase his business income by $306,916, $434,212 and $134,984.\n[43] Since the Respondent used the net worth method to calculate the unreported business income of the Appellant, he assumed that the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth each year and the amount that the Appellant spent on personal expenditures were funded by income that the Appellant had earned in each of the years.\n[44] The Respondent made a concession at the commencement of the hearing with respect to the amount of personal expenditures incurred by the Appellant in each of the relevant years. The Respondent conceded that the amount of personal expenditures should be reduced by $7,007.46 in 2009, $23,101.65 in 2010 and $16,503.74 in 2011. The Respondent concluded that such expenditures were business expenses of the Appellant. As a result, my judgment will reduce the Appellant\u2019s unreported business income by the amounts conceded by the Respondent.\n[45] Ms. Douglas provided detailed evidence regarding the calculations that she performed with respect to the net worth calculation. After taking into account all of the adjustments that she made, I am satisfied that her calculations contain no material errors.\n[46] Schedule I of the net worth calculation shows the Appellant\u2019s assets increasing from $428,592 at December 31, 2008 to $718,410 at December 31, 2009\u2013an increase of $289,818. However, Ms. Douglas subsequently reduced this amount by $145,000 to take into account her double counting of the asset shown on Schedule I as \u201cApartment Block \u2013 3 plex at 213 Crossley\u201d (the \u201cThree-plex\u201d). The double counting occurred when the Three-plex was included twice in Schedule I: once as \u201cUCC per Schedule 1a \u2013 CCA\u201d and a second time as \u201cApartment Block \u2013 3 plex 213 Crossley\u201d.\n[47] The Appellant testified that the Three-plex was a three-plex rental unit that he had built in 2009. The $145,000 reduction for the double counting is shown on Schedule V under the heading \u201cDeduct: Known audit adjustments, Other \u2013 Apartment blocks\u201d. The result of this reduction is that the Respondent calculated the Appellant\u2019s income for 2009 on the basis that his assets had increased by $144,818.[7]\n[48] All of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets in 2009 was due to the addition of the $145,000 Three-plex. There was no material change in any of the Appellant\u2019s other business or personal assets. In addition, there was no material change in the Appellant\u2019s liabilities in 2009.\n[49] Schedule I of the net worth calculation shows the Appellant\u2019s assets increasing from $718,410 at December 31, 2009 to $1,080,932 at December 31, 2010\u2013an increase of $362,522. However, Ms. Douglas subsequently reduced this amount by $194,500 to take into account her double counting of the asset shown on Schedule I as \u201cAoartment [sic] Block \u2013 4 plex at 235 Crossley\u201d (the \u201cFour\u2011plex\u201d). Similar to the double counting of the Three-plex, the double counting with respect to the Four-plex occurred when the Four-plex was included twice in the asset schedule: once in the amount shown as \u201cUCC per Schedule 1a \u2013 CCA\u201d and a second time as \u201cAoartment [sic] Block \u2013 4 plex 235 Crossley\u201d.\n[50] The Appellant testified that this was a four-plex rental unit that he had built in 2010. The $194,500 reduction is shown on Schedule V under the heading \u201cDeduct: Known audit adjustments, Other \u2013 Apartment block\u201d. The result of this reduction is that the Respondent calculated the Appellant\u2019s income for 2010 on the basis that his assets had increased by $168,022.[8]\n[51] Ms. Douglas\u2019s calculations actually understated the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets by $19,500. The $194,500 reduction for the double counting in the 2010 calculation is composed of her calculation of the cost of the Four-plex ($175,000) plus the cost of the land that the Appellant purchased in 2010 to build the Four-plex on ($19,500). However, Ms. Douglas did not double count the cost of the land; she only double counted the cost of the Four-plex itself.\n[52] Regardless, all of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s assets in 2010 was due to the addition of the land at 235 Crossley and the construction of the Four-plex on the land. There was no material change to the Appellant\u2019s liabilities in 2010.\n[53] The Appellant\u2019s assets at the end of 2011 were approximately the same as his assets at the end of 2010. The only difference was the sale of an undeveloped lot that he had owned for a number of years. There also was no material change in his liabilities in 2011.\n[54] In summary, all of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth in 2009, 2010 and 2011 was due to the construction of the Three-plex and the Four-plex and the acquisition of the land for the Four-plex.\n[55] Counsel for the Appellant argued that even after the adjustments were made by Ms. Douglas, there had been a double counting of the Three-plex in 2010. The above analysis shows that there was no double counting of the Three-plex after Ms. Douglas made her adjustments. The increase in net worth during the relevant periods corresponds with the only assets added during these periods, namely the Three\u2011plex and the Four-plex. The Appellant\u2019s liabilities had no impact on the change in his net worth since they remained relatively constant throughout the relevant periods.\n[56] The amounts shown as personal expenditures in Schedule III of the net worth calculation comprise over 90% of the adjustments made to the calculated change in net worth for each of the relevant years. In fact, the total of the increase in net worth caused by the addition of the Three-plex and the Four-plex and the total of the personal expenditures exceeds the total of the calculated unreported business income in each year. In other words, any calculated unreported income for the relevant years is solely dependent on the addition of the Three-plex, the addition of the Four-plex and the calculated personal expenditures. There are no other material numbers in the net worth calculation.\n[57] I will first address the inclusion of the Three-plex and the Four-plex in the calculation of the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth in 2009 and 2010.\n[58] The Appellant testified that he built the Three-plex and the Four-plex as rental properties.\n[59] The Appellant built the Three-plex at 213 Crossley Avenue in The Pas in 2009. The Appellant accepts that he acquired the land at 213 Crossley Avenue sometime before December 31, 2008, at a cost of $14,000.\n[60] The Appellant built the Four-plex at 235 Crossley in The Pas in 2010. The Appellant accepts that he acquired the land at 235 Crossley in 2010 at a cost of $19,500.\n[61] Ms. Douglas testified that during the audit, the Appellant informed her that he built the Three-plex in 2009 at a cost of between $140,000 and $150,000. She then, in her words, \u201csplit it down the middle\u201d and chose a 2009 construction cost of $145,000.\n[62] Similarly, the Appellant informed Ms. Douglas that he built the Four-plex in 2010 at a cost of between $170,000 and $180,000. She once again \u201csplit it down the middle\u201d and chose a 2010 construction cost of $175,000.\n[63] The Appellant did not provide the Court with reliable objective evidence that would demolish the Respondent\u2019s assumption that the cost of the Three-plex was approximately $145,000 and that the cost of the Four-plex was approximately $175,000.\n[64] Exhibit A-53 contains 175 pages of invoices that the Appellant testified related to the construction of the Three-plex. Exhibit A-54 contains approximately 400 pages of invoices that the Appellant testified related to the construction of the Four-plex.\n[65] The majority of the invoices in Exhibits A-53 and A-54 are for less than $500, and many are for less then $100. None of the invoices show the purchased materials being delivered to 213 or 235 Crossley Avenue.\n[66] I was not provided with a ledger or any schedule showing the costs of the various components of either building. Further, I was not provided with any objective evidence tying the invoices into the costs incurred to construct the Three\u2011plex and the Four-plex. I have no way of knowing whether the invoices include all of the costs of the Three-plex and Four-plex or whether they even relate to the construction of the two buildings. Some or all of the invoices could have related to the Appellant\u2019s contracting business.\n[67] The self-serving evidence of the Appellant alone, whom I found not to be a credible witness, is not sufficient for me to conclude that the invoices represent the total cost of the Three-plex and Four-plex or that all invoices relate to the construction of the two buildings.\n[68] The Appellant was asked during his examination-in- chief how he funded the construction of the two buildings. He stated the following:\nI \u2013 I did have some lots, and I sold the lots, and they were \u2013 so some of the money come from there. I borrowed some money from my mother-in-law, I borrowed money from my brother-in-law, I borrowed money from my dad, and when the threeplex \u2013 when \u2013 once the first building was up, the threeplex and we were getting rent from it, all of my rent \u2013 so I would get roughly about $3,000 a month, and then all that money from the rent would go straight into be \u2013 buy \u2013 buying material for the fourplex. And that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 and then \u2013 I was short money, so I would borrow money.[9]\n[69] The Appellant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his testimony during his discovery by the Respondent\u2019s counsel. When asked during his discovery examination how he funded the cost of the Three-plex and the Four-plex, he stated that he used his line of credit. During his cross-examination before the Court, he stated that he did not recall telling counsel during his discovery that he had used his line of credit.[10] This is one of many examples of instances where the Appellant\u2019s testimony before the Court contradicted his sworn testimony during discovery. These contradictions seriously damaged his credibility.\n[70] When asked whether he had any loan agreements with his family members the Appellant stated that he believed he had one with his mother-in-law.\n[71] The Appellant acknowledged that Ms. Douglas asked him to provide loan documents. He noted that the loans were just verbal; there were no documents. He also acknowledged that he could not show Ms. Douglas deposits on his bank statements that represented amounts received as loans.\n[72] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s verbal evidence that he received loans from family members. It is not supported by the objective evidence, particularly the fact that his bank statements do not show amounts received as loans being deposited into his account.\n[73] It is also damaging to the Appellant that he did not call a family member to testify that he or she made loans to the Appellant.\n[74] I have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before me, that the Appellant self\u2011funded the construction of the Three-plex and the Four-plex. The net worth calculation is consistent with this assumption.\n[75] With respect to rental income from the Three-plex, the Appellant\u2019s income tax return for 2009 showed no revenue from the Three-plex. His tax return for 2010 shows gross rental revenue of $17,970 and net income after expenses of $13,810. The Appellant may have used all or a portion of the $13,810 to pay for costs incurred to construct the Four-plex. In fact, the net worth calculation credits him for this income by reducing his unreported income by the amount of income (including rental income) reported on his 2010 tax return.\n[76] With respect to the line of credit, the Appellant acknowledged during his cross-examination that he could not have used the line since the balance in the line of credit was around $125,000 from December 2008 to the end of 2011. The $125,000 was the maximum amount that the Appellant was entitled to borrow under the line of credit.\n[77] For the foregoing reasons, I have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before the Court, that the Respondent has properly accounted for the Three-plex and the Four-plex when calculating the increase in the Appellant\u2019s net worth.\n[78] I will now address the positive adjustment made to the net worth calculation in respect of personal expenditures. In assessing the Appellant, the Minister assumed that the Appellant incurred personal expenditures of $220,013, $329,499 and $206,804 in his 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxation years, respectively.\n[79] Ms. Douglas explained that she used a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d analysis to determine the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures. This involved her reviewing the Appellant\u2019s bank statements, credit card statements and any of his other financial statements. She identified any withdrawals on the statements and categorized each withdrawal as a business expense, a personal expense or a transfer. Transfers were transfers between various accounts and were not included in the calculation of the Appellant\u2019s personal expenses or business expenses.\n[80] She then tried to group the personal expenses into 13 specific categories such as food, shelter, household operations, and clothing. Any withdrawals that she could not identify as business expenses or as expenses related to one of the 13 personal categories were included in miscellaneous personal expenses.\n[81] Ms. Douglas prepared detailed spreadsheets showing how she categorized each withdrawal noted on the Appellant\u2019s bank and credit card statements.[11] These spreadsheets were provided to the Appellant.\n[82] Ms. Douglas testified that she made the following assumptions when analyzing the bank statements and other financial records of the Appellant:\n-All expenses that were evidenced by invoices from one of his suppliers of building materials, such as Northern Building Supply, Home Hardware, and Timber Mart, were classified as business expenses. She did not try to determine if any of these invoices were in respect of personal expenditures.\n-She did not try to distinguish between business expenses incurred in respect of the Appellant\u2019s contracting business and business expenses incurred in the construction or maintenance of the two rental properties.\n-If the Appellant provided a cheque with respect to a specific withdrawal, then the cheque would be used to classify the withdrawal. If the cheque was payable to one of the suppliers of building materials or equipment, then the withdrawal was classified as a business expense. The withdrawals evidenced by the remaining cheques were placed in the appropriate personal expenditure category. For example, if the cheque was made payable to IGA, the withdrawal was included in the food category.\n-After discussing with the Appellant the items that he purchased at Costco, Ms. Douglas decided that any payments to Costco over $300 would be classified as business expenses, while payments under $300 would be classified as personal expenses.\n-Ms. Douglas decided that any cash withdrawals over $800 were business expenses. This was based on the assumption that the Appellant\u2019s bank limited the maximum amount of a single transaction on his debit card to $800. As a result, the Appellant was required to withdraw cash to purchase goods or services that cost in excess of $800.\n[83] Exhibits R-53, R-54, R-55, R-58, R-63 and R-64 evidence that Ms. Douglas examined over 1,300 pages of invoices from the Appellant\u2019s suppliers of building materials. Exhibits R-26, R-27 and R-28 contain Ms. Douglas\u2019s spreadsheets summarizing the withdrawals that she identified as business expenses. These spreadsheets show that Ms. Douglas identified 33 suppliers of business materials and services in 2009 and 35 in 2010 and 2011.\n[84] Exhibit R-23 contains a summary of Ms. Douglas\u2019s analysis of the Appellant\u2019s bank statements and other financial statements; it shows the following:\n-In 2009, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $386,083 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $166,070 were business expenses and $220,012 were personal expenses.\n-In 2010, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $635,145 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $305,646 were business expenses and $329,498 were personal expenses.\n-In 2011, after accounting for transfers, Ms. Douglas identified $389,049 of withdrawals of which she assumed, on the basis of her analysis, $182,246 were business expenses and $206,804 were personal expenses.\n[85] Ms. Douglas categorized a substantial amount of the personal expenses as miscellaneous expenditures: $148,348 in 2009, $244,364 in 2010 and $146,813 in 2011.\n[86] During his examination-in-chief of the Appellant, counsel for the Appellant noted that the Appellant is not disputing any of the personal expenditures other than the miscellaneous expenditures.[12] This concession in and of itself results in the Appellant having significant unreported income in 2009 and 2010. If I remove the miscellaneous personal expenses from the net worth calculation, the calculation results in $163,161 of unreported income in 2009 and $195,852 of unreported income in 2010.\n[87] Although the Appellant does not accept the amounts calculated for miscellaneous expenditures, he has produced no evidence to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption that the Appellant incurred the personal expenditures set out in Schedule IV to the Reply, which includes the miscellaneous expenditures. This is an assumption that the Minister made when assessing the Appellant. The Court must accept this assumption unless the Appellant presents evidence to \u201cdestroy\u201d it.\n[88] The Appellant has produced no such evidence. He testified that his position is that all expenses categorized as miscellaneous expenditures were in fact business expenses. He also testified that even though he was provided with Ms. Douglas\u2019s detailed calculation of the specific withdrawals that she classified as miscellaneous expenses, he did not inform the Respondent of any specific items that he disagreed with or provide him with any evidence to show that a specific item that Ms. Douglas classified as a miscellaneous personal expense was in fact a business expense. More importantly, the Appellant did not provide such evidence to the Court. The Court received no evidence from the Appellant with respect to any of the specific withdrawals that the Respondent classified as miscellaneous expenses. In such a situation, the Court accepts the Minister\u2019s assumption with respect to the amount of the miscellaneous expenditures.\n[89] Further, I have concluded, on the basis of Ms. Douglas\u2019s testimony and her working papers, that she took a fair and reasonable approach to calculating the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures using the information provided to her by the Appellant. She clearly spent a significant amount of time analyzing the Appellant\u2019s bank accounts, credit card statements and line of credit statements and provided the Appellant with numerous opportunities to clarify the nature of the various withdrawals.\n[90] Based on the foregoing, I accept the Minister\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s personal expenditures for each of the relevant years.\n[91] For the foregoing reasons, I also accept the Minister\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s unreported income. The calculations undertaken by Ms. Douglas are supported by the evidence before the Court and provide the only reliable evidence of the Appellant\u2019s income during the relevant years.\nAppellant\u2019s argument with respect to lifestyle\n[92] While my conclusion disposes of the appeal as it relates to unreported income, I will address the Appellant\u2019s main argument.\n[93] As discussed, the Appellant did not provide any reliable evidence to challenge Ms. Douglas\u2019s calculation of the Appellant\u2019s unreported net income. The Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that the Appellant\u2019s frugal lifestyle simply does not support the assessed amounts.\n[94] Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Appellant\u2019s family\u2019s primary sources of income were the income that the Appellant received from working full\u2011time as a Zamboni driver for the town of The Pas and the income that Mrs. Demchynski received from working as a housekeeper at a care centre. Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Appellant\u2019s lifestyle does not reflect the lifestyle of someone who had earned the unreported income determined by the net worth calculation. He also noted that there were no \u201cassets of extravagance\u201d in the net worth calculation.\n[95] The Appellant\u2019s argument is predicated on the assumption that the Appellant\u2019s family\u2019s primary source of income was the $21.51 per hour that he was paid by the town and the $15 per hour that Mrs. Demchynski earned working at the care centre. Counsel also relied heavily on the testimony of Mrs. Demchynski and the Appellant that the family lived a frugal lifestyle.\n[96] The nature of the lifestyle that a family leads has little relevance to the determination of whether they had unreported income. More importantly, the evidence before the Court contradicts the factual foundation of the Appellant\u2019s argument.\n[97] Firstly, I have found, as a question of fact, that the Appellant\u2019s primary source of income was his contracting business\u2013a business that had gross receipts well in excess of $1 million during the relevant period.\n[98] Secondly, the evidence before me is that the Appellant\u2019s family did not live a frugal lifestyle.\n[99] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s and Mrs. Demchynski\u2019s testimony during their examination-in-chief that they lived a frugal lifestyle. Their testimony was destroyed on cross-examination.\n[100] After numerous questions from counsel for the Respondent and frequent references to prior inconsistent statements made by the Appellant during his discovery examination, the Appellant finally admitted that he had spent a good deal of time at a time-share that the family owned in Las Vegas. I have concluded, on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s demeanour and his answers to counsel\u2019s questions during cross\u2011examination, that the evidence that he provided during his discovery is the most reliable evidence of the time that the family spent in Las Vegas, being eight weeks per year. In addition, I have concluded, on the basis of the cross\u2011examination, that the Appellant\u2019s interest in the time-share entitled him to stay four weeks per year at the time-share. He spent an additional $10,000 per year to purchase the additional four weeks per year that his family spent in Las Vegas at the time-share. This is not a frugal lifestyle.\n[101] The Appellant acknowledged on cross-examination that he purchased a home in Las Vegas in 2013. After he purchased the home, he retained the interest in the time-share. While I acknowledge that 2013 is outside of the relevant period, the fact that he purchased the home in 2013 is consistent with the evidence before me that he spent significant time in Las Vegas.\n[102] The Appellant\u2019s testimony with respect to Las Vegas is one of numerous instances where he attempted to hide from the Court his actual lifestyle. His evidence on this point seriously damaged his credibility.\n[103] As discussed previously, during the relevant period the Appellant built a Three\u2011plex and a Four\u2011plex at a cost of at least $320,000. There is no evidence before the Court that the Appellant borrowed any monies to fund the construction of the two complexes. They were self-funded. This may not be an \u201casset of extravagance\u201d, but the self-funding of this acquisition during the relevant period is not consistent with the income that the Appellant reported on his income tax returns.\n[104] Regardless of the Appellant\u2019s actual lifestyle, I have accepted Ms. Douglas\u2019s net worth calculation. It is the only reliable evidence before me of the Appellant\u2019s income during the relevant periods.\nPenalties under subsection 163(2)\n[105] Subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty on every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a tax return.\n[106] The Federal Court of Appeal noted in Wynter v. Canada,[13] that the knowledge requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer had an actual intent to make a false statement or the taxpayer is wilfully blind. The court explained that:\nA taxpayer is wilfully blind in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth. The concept is one of deliberate ignorance. \u2026\n\u2026 wilful blindness pivots on a finding that the taxpayer deliberately chose not to make inquiries in order to avoid verifying that which might be such an inconvenient truth. The essential factual element is a finding of deliberate ignorance, as it \u201cconnotes \u2018an actual process of suppressing a suspicion.\u2019\u201d\n[107] The Federal Court of Appeal noted that gross negligence is distinct from wilful blindness. Gross negligence \u201c\u2026 arises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable taxpayer. \u2026\u201d[14]\n[108] Under subsection 163(3), the Minister has the burden of establishing the facts that justify the assessment of a penalty under subsection 163(2).\n[109] For the following reasons, I find that the Appellant knowingly made false statements in his income tax return for each of the relevant years. Specifically, he knowingly understated his income from his contracting business and failed to report his income in 2010 from the sale of the vacant lots.\n[110] In each of the relevant years, the Appellant\u2019s tax returns significantly understated his income from his contracting business.\n[111] In his 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns, the Appellant reported gross sales from his contracting business of $45,180, $45,814 and $54,225.80 respectively.[15] These numbers are clearly incorrect since, as discussed previously, the Appellant\u2019s gross income from his contracting business in 2009, 2010 and 2011 was at least $250,559, $451,356 and $209,692 respectively and appears to have been significantly higher.\n[112] With respect to expenses, the Appellant claimed, in his tax returns for 2009, 2010 and 2011, expenses in respect of his contracting business of $45,831, $47,105 and $66,549.99 respectively. The expenses shown on his statement of business or professional activities filed with his income tax return were composed of supplies; subcontracts; legal, accounting and other fees; telephone and utilities; fuel costs; salaries, wages and benefits; capital cost allowance; registration, repairs and gas for equipment; and interest.[16]\n[113] The Appellant then reported losses from his contracting business in his 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax returns of $651, $1,291.58 and $12,324.19 respectively.[17] The reporting of these losses constitutes a false statement. In each of these years, the Appellant realized a substantial profit from his contracting business. These profits constituted most of the unreported income of the Appellant.\n[114] The Appellant signed each of these tax returns, certifying that the information in each of the returns was correct, was complete, and fully disclosed all of his income. He testified that he reviewed the returns before they were filed.\n[115] The Appellant first testified that the gross revenue that appears on the income tax returns is actually his net profit from each job. He testified that he provided the accountant who prepared his tax returns with the net profit from his contracting business as opposed to the gross income and actual expenses from the business.\n[116] However, on cross-examination, counsel for the Respondent pointed out to the Appellant that he claimed on the statement of business or professional activities filed with his return a number of expenses in respect of his contracting business, such as supplies, subcontracts, salaries and wages, and equipment expenses. The Appellant then claimed that he was not sure how his income from his contracting business was reported on his tax return.\n[117] I have concluded, on the basis of the fact that each of the statements of business or professional activities that the Appellant filed with his income tax returns shows an amount for gross income and detailed expenses, that the statements are intended to report what they show, namely the gross income from the Appellant\u2019s contracting business and the expenses that he incurred in earning this gross income.\n[118] The Appellant testified that an accountant prepared his income tax returns. However, the space on each income tax return where a professional tax preparer acknowledges that he or she prepared the return is blank. Other than the Appellant\u2019s oral testimony, the Court has no evidence to support his assertion that an accountant prepared his tax returns.\n[119] Regardless, what is clear from the evidence before me is that the Appellant provided all of the information that was used to calculate the Appellant\u2019s income from his contracting business\u2013information that grossly understates his income from the business.\n[120] The Appellant consistently stated that he did not understand the information on his tax return. I do not accept this testimony. Clearly, he understood the information since he prepared it and provided it to the accountant.\n[121] I have concluded that as a question of fact, the Appellant knowingly understated the income from his contracting business that he reported on his income tax returns for each of the relevant years.\n[122] He also knowingly failed to report the profit that he realized in 2010 on the sale of the two lots discussed previously. The sales are not reported on the Appellant\u2019s 2010 tax return.\n[123] The Appellant claimed that the sale of the lots was included in his statement of business or professional activities. I do not accept this testimony. The Appellant provided no documentary evidence to show how he determined the loss from his business as reported on his tax return or to show the amount, if any, that he included as profit from the sale of the two lots.\n[124] Further, the gross proceeds from the sale of the two lots was $48,000, whereas the gross revenue reported on his statement of business or professional activities was $45,814. In other words, the statement of business or professional activities does not include the profit that the Appellant realized on the sale of the lots. He clearly realized a profit since between 2005 and 2010, he sold eight lots for gross proceeds of $154,000 that had a cost of $62,000.[18]\n[125] In summary, the Appellant is liable for the penalty imposed under subsection 163(2) in respect of his unreported income.\n[126] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed in part to incorporate the concessions made by the Respondent. The assessments are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the unreported income of the Appellant is as follows:\n-For the 2009 taxation year, the $311,509 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $7,007.46 concession made by the Respondent.\n-For the 2010 taxation year, the $440,216 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $23,101.65 concession made by the Respondent.\n-For the 2011 taxation year, the $142,184 of unreported business income determined by the net worth calculation minus the $16,503.74 concession made by the Respondent.\n[127] The parties have 60 days from the date of this judgment to make written representations with respect to the amount of costs that the Court should award the Respondent. The written submissions shall not exceed 15 pages. If no submissions are received, costs shall be awarded to the Respondent as set out in the Tariff.\nSigned at Edmonton, Alberta, this 14th day of February 2024.\n\u201cS.

The Canada Child Benefit [1] Parliament created the Canada Child Benefit (the \u201cCCB\u201d) as an income-tested tax-free monthly payment administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. The rules surrounding the CCB are found in Subdivision A.1 of the Income Tax Act.[1]\n[2] The CCB was introduced in 2016 to replace the Canada Child Tax Benefit (the \u201cCCTB\u201d) and the Universal Child Care Benefit (the \u201cUCCB\u201d).[2] The CCB differs most significantly from the prior programs in that it is income-based and non-taxable.[3]\n[3] To receive the CCB, the taxpayer must live with a child who is under 18 years of age, be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of the child, be a resident of Canada for tax purposes, and be or be the spouse or common-law spouse of someone who is: a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, a protected person, or a temporary resident, within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act[4], or an individual who is registered, or entitled to be registered, under the Indian Act.[5]\nB. Part A \u2013 CCB Eligibility [4] Part A of this appeal determines whether refugee claimants are included in the constructive definition of temporary resident and, therefore, are entitled to the CCB.\n[5] The Minister excluded Ms. Yao and Ms. Zhang (the \u201cAppellants\u201d) during the relevant periods from the CCB because they were not temporary residents. The rationale is that, as refugee claimants, they were persons not clothed with a status of sufficient permanence under the IRPA to provide a nexus to Canada above a threshold embedded within the concept of temporary resident.\n[6] The Appellants argue that a textual, contextual, and purposive reading of the CCB provisions reveals that refugee claimants are included in the definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d and are therefore eligible for the CCB.\nC. Part B \u2013 Constitutional Challenge Under Sections 7 and 15 of the Charter [7] Part B of this appeal determines whether the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[6]\n[8] The Appellants claim that interpreting the ITA and the IRPA to exclude refugee claimants from the CCB contravenes their right to security of the person under section 7 of the Charter in a way that is not within the principles of fundamental justice.\n[9] The Appellants also claim that the denying of the CCB contravenes their right to equality under section 15 of the Charter on the enumerated ground of race or on an analogous grounds of immigration status.\nPreliminary Note: Intervenor [10] Throughout these reasons, the position of the Appellants are described as such. To clarify, at the hearing the Intervenor, through counsel, almost invariably proffered submissions -- there was no examination or cross-examination by Intervenor counsel, although offered -- which differed only slightly from counsel for the Appellants, or were entirely compatible. To the extent the Court determines it relevant, specific reference is made to the Intervenor\u2019s submissions.\nII. FACTS IN GENERAL A. CCB Process and Refugee Claimants [11] There are no material facts in dispute in these appeals. It would be simple to list the facts in a truncated narrative form. To do so in these appeals would be facile and unappreciative. The manifest struggle of refugee claimants is a frequent story in Canada, frequently informed and authored by the insensitive political, legal and\/or economic structures of foreign regimes. Therefore, although less time might be spent on the facts of the Appellants\u2019 specific stories, the Court expends some effort to ensure that the stories are told.\nB. Refugee Claimant Status [12] At the relevant times, Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were refugee claimants. For part of the period, Ms. Yao was also challenging the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \u201cIRB\u201d), which rejected her refugee claim, in the Federal Court of Canada (\u201cFederal Court\u201d). Ms. Yao\u2019s son, however, was a Canadian citizen at all times.\nC. CCTB or CCB Claim Process [13] A resident of Canada must actively apply for the CCB. The application form for the CCB or, as it was previously named the CCTB, is form RC66. In the application form, the claimant must state whether they (and their spouse or common-law partner) are citizens of Canada. If they are not citizens, or if they recently became new residents of Canada or returned as residents to Canada in the last two years, then they must complete another form: Status in Canada\/Statement of Income form RC66SCl-L.\n[14] In processing an application for the CCTB or the CCB, the CRA does not ask the claimant why they came to Canada.\nD. Ms. Yao a) Ms. Yao\u2019s background [15] Ms. Yao married in Canada in August 2014. She and her husband were citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). Their son was born in Toronto in 2015. Therefore, the son is a Canadian citizen, while neither Ms. Yao nor her husband are or were.\n[16] While residing with Ms. Yao, the husband was issued temporary work permits by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d).\n[17] Ms. Yao entered Canada on foot near Vancouver, British Columbia in August 2012. She did not hold a permanent resident visa as required under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations in order to establish permanent resident status. She claimed refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[18] On March 20, 2014, the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB determined that Ms. Yao was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nb) Ms. Yao\u2019s refugee claim history [19] On April 1, 2014, Ms. Yao appealed the Refugee Protection Division decision to the Refugee Appeal Division of the IRB. Later that month, the Refugee Appeal Division dismissed her appeal. In response, Ms. Yao filed an application for leave and judicial review of the decision, logically to stave off deportation.\n[20] On March 12, 2015, the Federal Court granted Ms. Yao\u2019s application for leave and judicial review of the Refugee Protection Division decision. In September of 2015, the Federal Court granted the application for leave and judicial review of the Refugee Protection Division decision. On September 22, 2015, Ms. Yao was issued a new work permit by IRCC. She was issued subsequent temporary work permits in seriatim for the period from the original work permit in 2015 until she was declared a refugee on September 4, 2019.\nc) Ms. Yao\u2019s CCTB (now CCB) claim history [21] Ms. Yao applied for the CCTB, in respect of her son, retroactive to March 30, 2015.\n[22] On August 20, 2015, the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) issued to Ms. Yao a Notice of Determination, which identified the amount to which Ms. Yao was entitled in respect of the CCTB. In February 2016, the Minister terminated payments to Ms. Yao under the CCTB. On July 1, 2016, the CCTB was replaced with the CCB.\n[23] On August 19, 2016, the Minister redetermined Ms. Yao\u2019s entitlement and requested that Ms. Yao repay overpayments of the CCB totalling $1,199.21. In June 2017, Ms. Yao served a Notice of Objection and a request for an extension of time to file her Notice of Objection. In July 2017, the CRA granted Ms. Yao\u2019s application for an extension of time to file her Notice of Objection, and requested documentation supporting her eligibility for the CCB. After Ms. Yao responded, the Minister issued a Notice of Confirmation, confirming the redetermination of Ms. Yao\u2019s eligibility and effectively denying her the CCB on the basis of her status as a refugee claimant.\nd) Ms. Yao\u2019s testimony concerning her challenges [24] Ms. Yao, like most refugee claimants, has had considerable financial challenges, arriving virtually penniless in a new country and unable to speak either official language. She attempted to reduce the language barrier by taking English lessons when she arrived in 2012. Although irrelevant to her appeal, her process for entry into Canada was unorthodox and suspect, and involved some unscrupulous actors. She paid some $20,000 to $30,000 Canadian to an illicit Chinese immigration \u201cconsultant\u201d, commonly known as a \u201csnakehead.\u201d\n[25] In 2014, Ms. Yao married. She and her husband separated sometime in 2017 or so. During that period, the family supported itself through her husband\u2019s intermittent income of $2,000 to $3,000 per month. She herself was employed selling skincare products. Her income was $1,000 per month or less. More recently, her income has become more stable.\n[26] During 2015 and 2016, Ms. Yao was originally paid the CCB (then the CCTB). The money assisted her with necessities. After the benefit was terminated, her testimony was that she resorted to second-hand stores, borrowed items and community help. During that period, she was sad, anxious and without much hope. By contrast, now that the benefit has been restored, swimming lessons, marital arts lessons, piano lessons and golf lessons are within reach financially. Healthcare was always accessible.\n[27] Her accommodation has changed as well. In 2014, she lived in the basement of a semi-detached house. In 2016, she moved to a large condominium. In this location, she had security, parking and close proximity (less than a block) to her son\u2019s school. In 2017, she again relocated to a two-storey house with a basement, double-car garage and a backyard. She lives there presently.\nE. Ms. Zhang a) Ms. Zhang\u2019s background [28] Ms. Zhang and her children\u2019s pathway to refugee status is slightly more straightforward. The period in issue for Ms. Zhang is March 2018 to May 2019. During that time, she was a refugee claimant, and like all refugee claimants, under a conditional departure order.\n[29] Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were essentially in the same position as Ms. Zhang to the extent that they had no different \u201cimmigration status\u201d than their mother. Her children were both born in China, her daughter in 2010 and her son in 2012.\n[30] Ms. Zhang divorced her husband, himself a Chinese citizen who never resided in Canada, in early 2018. At that time, Ms. Zhang was granted sole custody of her children by court order.\nb) Ms. Zhang\u2019s refugee claim history [31] From April 2013 to October 2014, Ms. Zhang and her children were in Canada by virtue of Ms. Zhang\u2019s study permit and V-1 visitor permits. Ms. Zhang and her children were all back in China by August 2014, prior to the expiration of the permits.\n[32] In May 2017, Ms. Zhang claimed refugee protection under the IRPA. She and her children received a refugee claimant document and qualified for interim federal healthcare. A conditional departure order was also issued.\n[33] From summer 2017 to October 2020, various work and study permits were issued, expired and\/or were extended. Finally, in December of 2020, Ms. Zhang was issued a study permit, valid until August 31, 2023. It stated on its face, like all the others, that it \u201cdoes not confer temporary resident status\u201d.\nc) Ms. Zhang\u2019s CCB claim history [34] Ms. Zhang applied for the CCB in respect of her children in May 2017. On July 20, 2017, the Minister issued to Ms. Zhang a Notice of Determination, stating that she was not entitled to the CCB for the 2016 base year.\n[35] This Notice of Determination is not under appeal.\n[36] Ms. Zhang again applied for the CCB in respect of her children by application dated May 4, 2018. On July 20, 2018, the Minister issued a Notice of Determination, notifying Ms. Zhang that she was entitled to the CCB for the 2016 base year. In 2018, a similar notice advised Ms. Zhang that she qualified for the 2017 base year.\n[37] On September 20, 2019, the Minister changed her mind and notified Ms. Zhang that she was not entitled to the CCB for the 2016 and 2017 base years. On November 13, 2019, Ms. Zhang served a Notice of Objection in respect of the notices of determination disentitling her to the CCB. The Minister subsequently confirmed the denial of the CCB for the 2016 and 2017 base taxation years.\nd) Ms. Zhang\u2019s testimony concerning her challenges [38] The purpose of Ms. Zhang\u2019s second entry into Canada in August 2016 with her two children was twofold. Firstly, she wanted to study in Canada from August to December 2016. Secondly, and more existentially, she was fleeing an intolerable domestic arrangement, greater details of which are constrained by this Court\u2019s own confidentiality order.\n[39] From 2017 until 2020, Ms. Zhang and her children lived in a secure living arrangement. Ultimately, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice awarded her sole custody under various protective court orders.\n[40] During the years from 2018 to 2020, Ms. Zhang pursued her post-graduate studies and further continued her professional education in the fall of 2020.\n[41] Her financial situation during these years was precarious. She used supports from parents, her community, food banks and churches to survive financially. She described her situation as \u201cvery tight\u201d financially. She was an excellent student and received numerous bursaries and awards. The CCB moneys, when received for an interim period, were used for better clothing, groceries such as fresh fruits and vegetables and, of particular pride, extracurricular activities for her children.\n[42] Ultimately, after the relevant periods ended, in 2019 and 2020, the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB determined that Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children were Convention refugees.\n[43] This meant that refugee protection was conferred on them and they became protected persons within the meaning of the IRPA. This also meant that Ms. Yao, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Zhang\u2019s children became eligible individuals for the purposes of the CCB, under subparagraph 122.6(e)(iii) of the ITA.\nIII. PART A \u2013 CCB ELIGIBILITY [44] At a high level, the first specific issue in these appeals is:\nDid Ms. Yao and\/or Ms. Zhang, as refugee claimants, qualify as eligible individuals within the meaning of subparagraph 122.6(e) of the ITA?\nA. Meaning of Temporary Resident [45] The determination of who qualifies for the CCB is governed by the ITA, the IRPA, and the Regulations thereunder. The ITA defines \u201celigible individual\u201d to include a \u201ctemporary resident within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u201d. However, \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not explicitly defined in the IRPA.\n[46] The Appellants, as refugee claimants, argue that they fall within the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Accordingly, the issue before this Court is whether, under subparagraph 122.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, a refugee claimant is a temporary resident within the meaning of the IRPA and is therefore eligible for the CCB.\na) Excerpt from the ITA [47] Eligible individuals are entitled to apply for the CCB pursuant to section 122.6 of the ITA. Paragraph 122.6(e) defines \u201celigible individual\u201d as follows:\neligible individual in respect of a qualified dependent at any time means a person who at that time\n\u2026\n(e) is, or whose cohabiting spouse or common-law partner is, a Canadian citizen or a person who\n(i) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\n(ii) is a temporary resident within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, who was resident in Canada throughout the 18 month period preceding that time,\n(iii) is a protected person within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\n(iv) was determined before that time to be a member of a class defined in the Humanitarian Designated Classes Regulations made under the Immigration Act, or\n(v) is an Indian within the meaning of the Indian Act,\n[Emphasis added.]\nb)Excerpts from the IRPA [48] The IRPA does not define \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Instead, the IRPA describes the process and means by which one becomes a temporary resident.\n[49] Section 22 authorizes an immigration officer (\u201cIO\u201d) to determine whether a foreign national qualifies to be a temporary resident.\nTemporary resident\n22 (1) A foreign national becomes a temporary resident if an officer is satisfied that the foreign national has applied for that status, has met the obligations set out in paragraph 20(1)(b), is not inadmissible and is not the subject of a declaration made under subsection 22.1(1).\nDual intent\n(2) An intention by a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\n[50] Section 24 provides that an IO may grant a temporary resident permit.\nTemporary resident permit\n24 (1) A foreign national who, in the opinion of an officer, is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of this Act becomes a temporary resident if an officer is of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances and issues a temporary resident permit, which may be cancelled at any time.\nException\n(2) A foreign national referred to in subsection (1) to whom an officer issues a temporary resident permit outside Canada does not become a temporary resident until they have been examined upon arrival in Canada.\nInstructions of Minister\n(3) In applying subsection (1), the officer shall act in accordance with any instructions that the Minister may make.\nRestriction \u2014 pending application for protection\n(3.1) A foreign national whose claim for refugee protection has been determined to be ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division may not request a temporary resident permit if they have made an application for protection to the Minister that is pending.\nRestriction\n(4) A foreign national whose claim for refugee protection has not been allowed may not request a temporary resident permit if less than 12 months have passed since\n(a) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Protection Division, in the case where no appeal was made and no application was made to the Federal Court for leave to commence an application for judicial review; or\n(b) in any other case, the latest of\n(i) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Protection Division or, if there was more than one such rejection or determination, the day on which the last one occurred,\n(ii) the day on which their claim was rejected or determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the Refugee Appeal Division or, if there was more than one such rejection or determination, the day on which the last one occurred, and\n(iii) the day on which the Federal Court refused their application for leave to commence an application for judicial review, or denied their application for judicial review, with respect to their claim.\nRestriction \u2014 designated foreign national\n(5) A designated foreign national may not request a temporary resident permit\n(a) if they have made a claim for refugee protection but have not made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the claim is made;\n(b) if they have made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the application is made; or\n(c) in any other case, until five years after the day on which the foreign national becomes a designated foreign national.\nSuspension of request\n(6) The processing of a request for a temporary resident permit of a foreign national who, after the request is made, becomes a designated foreign national is suspended\n(a) if the foreign national has made a claim for refugee protection but has not made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the claim is made;\n(b) if the foreign national has made an application for protection, until five years after the day on which a final determination in respect of the application is made; or\n(c) in any other case, until five years after the day on which the foreign national becomes a designated foreign national.\nRefusal to consider request\n(7) The officer may refuse to consider a request for a temporary resident permit if\n(a) the designated foreign national fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any condition imposed on them under subsection 58(4) or section 58.1 or any requirement imposed on them under section 98.1; and\nb) less than 12 months have passed since the end of the applicable period referred to in subsection (5) or (6).\n[51] Subsection 46(1.1) provides that automatic conferral of temporary resident status occurs after renunciation of permanent resident status.\nEffect of renunciation\n46(1.1) A person who loses their permanent resident status under paragraph (1)(e) becomes a temporary resident for a period of six months unless they make their application to renounce their permanent resident status at a port of entry or are not physically present in Canada on the day on which their application is approved.\n[52] Certain protected refugees are granted temporary resident status under subsection 95(1).\nConferral of refugee protection\n95 (1) Refugee protection is conferred on a person when\n(a) the person has been determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances under a visa application and becomes a permanent resident under the visa or a temporary resident under a temporary resident permit for protection reasons;\n(b) the Board determines the person to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection; or\n(c) except in the case of a person described in subsection 112(3), the Minister allows an application for protection.\n[53] This list is exhaustive and is not open and flexible. Notably, temporary resident status requires an IO or Board decision.\nc) Jurisprudence 1. Leading Authority [54] Almadhoun v. Canada [7] is the leading case resolving whether a refugee claimant is a temporary resident within the meaning of the IRPA. In Almadhoun, the Federal Court of Appeal (the \u201cFCA\u201d) agreed with the Tax Court that a refugee claimant is not a temporary resident and is therefore not an eligible individual for the purposes of section 122.6 of the ITA. The FCA, at paragraphs 17 and 18, held:\n[17] \u2026 There is absolutely nothing in the legislation to support the appellant\u2019s assertion that section 122.6 of the Act necessarily includes a person whose application for status as a protected person is pending, and the appellant was unable to provide any case law in support of her contention. Contrary to Ms. Almadhoun\u2019s argument, there is no gap in the legislation; Parliament made a conscious policy choice as to the groups of persons on whom social benefits would be conferred. It is not for this Court to second-guess that deliberate choice \u2026\n[18] The same reasoning applies in response to the appellant\u2019s second argument, namely that she should be considered at the very least a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d with the meaning of the IRPA. The IRPA provides a process for the determination of temporary residency, which is not an open and flexible category. \u2026\n[55] The Appellants correctly recognize that in order to depart from vertical precedent, including decisions of the FCA, it is not enough to be manifestly wrong.[8] The appeal must raise a new legal issue, or present new evidence that will \u201cfundamentally shift how jurists understand the legal question at issue.\u201d[9] The question at issue is admittedly a question of law, so new evidence cannot help.\n[56] Where the same legal issue before the Tax Court is re-litigated, Almadhoun is binding, except in rare circumstances.[10] The Appellants cite the Supreme Court of Canada case Bedford[11] to assert that raising a new \u201ccritical statutory provision\u201d is just such a sufficiently rare circumstance that applies in this case.[12] In Almadhoun, the Court did not analyze the relevant IRPA provisions, the Convention on the Rights of the Child[13] or statements of legislative intent. Further, Almadhoun was limited to on a strict textual interpretation of \u201celigible individual\u201d.\n[57] The Respondent argues that because the issue in Almadhoun is the same issue before this Court, Almadhoun is binding on this Court.[14] Accordingly, a refugee claimant is not included in the meaning of temporary resident under the IRPA and is therefore not eligible for the CCB.\nAnalysis\n[58] Almadhoun is prima facie binding on this Court. The FCA specifically considered subparagraph 122.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, the same statutory provision raised in this appeal. This leads to the same issue being squarely before the Court: whether, under subparagraph 112.6(e)(ii) of the ITA, a refugee claimant is a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d within the meaning of the IRPA.\n[59] The Appellants\u2019 assertion that raising a new \u201ccritical statutory provision\u201d allows a court to reconsider a settled issue is not founded in jurisprudence. It is partially correct that the Tax Court can depart from vertical precedent \u201cif new legal issues are raised as a consequence of significant developments in the law, or if there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate.\u201d[15] However, Bedford was about Charter provisions, not about \u201ccritical provisions\u201d from legislation in general.\n[60] To expand upon the Appellants\u2019 quotation from Bedford, \u201ca trial judge can consider and decide arguments based on Charter provisions that were not raised in the earlier case; this constitutes a new legal issue.\u201d[16] Raising a new Charter challenge is more than just highlighting a different statutory provision; it raises a new independent claim. Further, the \u201csignificant development in the law\u201d in Bedford allowing precedent to be re-argued was the development of jurisprudence on the \u201cprinciples of fundamental justice\u201d which significantly changed the s. 7 analysis.\n[61] Identifying other provisions of the IRPA does not create new issues in the way that bringing a claim under the Charter or under a different Charter provision does. Further, the CRC and all documents regarding legislative intent were available at the time Almadhoun was heard, so no significant change in the law is apparent. Although the FCA\u2019s discussion on the \u201ctemporary resident\u201d provision is short, that alone is not enough to overturn the binding precedent on the basis of new legislative facts or legislative amendments, when factually such terrain was identical when viewed by the FCA.\n[62] To overturn vertical precedent, there must be a new issue raised, or a change in the law or circumstances that \u201cfundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate.\u201d[17] The Appellants assert that the FCA incorrectly interpreted the legislation because it did not look at other materials such as other sections of the IRPA, the CRC, and other documents indicating legislative intent.[18] This is insufficient to overturn binding precedent. As a result, Almadhoun is binding on this Court.\nd) Interpretation of the Statutes [63] The question of whether refugee claimants are \u201ctemporary residents\u201d and therefore \u201celigible individuals\u201d under s. 122.6 can only be reconsidered if Almadhoun is not binding on this Court because the Court is prepared to distinguish it. For completeness, and despite the binding nature of Almadhoun, the Court pursues this issue.\n[64] This is an issue of statutory interpretation. The Appellants argue that the interpretation should look beyond the text of the provision. The Court should take a contextual and purposive approach to resolve ambiguity.[19] The Appellants also assert that further ambiguities should be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.[20] Benefit schemes should be given a large and liberal interpretation, and such an approach has been applied to the CCB regime in the past.[21]\n[65] In Qu\u00e9bec (Communaut\u00e9 urbaine) v. Corp Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours,[22] the Supreme Court set out the principles which are to govern interpretation of tax legislation. The Court found that the interpretation of tax legislation should follow the ordinary rules of interpretation and that the choice between a strict or liberal reading of the text must not be guided by presumptions favourable to the state or the taxpayer, but by reference to the goal which underlies the provision.[23]\n[66] The ordinary rule of statutory interpretation is that \u201c[t]he words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.\u201d[24] The first step is to examine the text of the provision to determine its plain or ordinary meaning. However, the true meaning of the words can only be determined contextually by considering other indicators of legislative meaning, including context, purpose, and relevant legal norms.[25]\n1. Immigration vs. Tax Issue [67] Before discussing the text, context, and purpose, it is necessary to resolve the extent to which the Court should look at the IRPA and the functioning of the immigration regime to interpret this ITA provision.\n[68] The Appellants argue that it is incorrect to look at the IRPA to resolve ambiguity about the ITA. The interpretation should focus on the CCB regime as this is not an immigration law case.[26] The Appellants cite the Alberta Court of Appeal (\u201cABCA\u201d) decision Alberta v. ENMAX[27] as authority that the focus should be on the purpose and context of the ITA \u2013specifically the CCB regime\u2013 and not the IRPA and its immigration regime.[28]\n[69] ENMAX focused on a provision of Alberta\u2019s provincial energy regulation regime (the \u201cprimary regime\u201d). This provision required a calculation of \u201can amount equal to the amount of tax\u201d that an entity would be liable to pay under the ITA (the \u201csecondary regime\u201d).[29] To calculate that amount payable, the trial judge \u201ceffectively determined that anything outside the ITA was irrelevant\u201d.[30] The ABCA instead used the purpose and context informing the primary regime, resulting in a calculation that was different than if it had been done for income tax purposes instead.\n[70] The Respondent asserts that the phrase \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u201d invites and directs the Court to look at the entirety of the IRPA to determine the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d. Further, Parliament has the right to determine immigration policy. Assigning the term \u201ctemporary resident\u201d a meaning other than what it means in the IRPA will undermine that right and affect Canada\u2019s immigration policy while ingoing the use of such definition.\n[71] In ENMAX, the ABCA did not ignore the secondary regime. Rather, the Court looked at the context and purpose of the primary regime and found that the ITA calculation would have contravened that purpose. The purpose and context of the secondary regime need not be ignored, it just ought not to undermine the primary regime\u2019s purpose.\n[72] By analogy in these appeals, the CCB provisions of the ITA create the primary regime, and the IRPA is the secondary regime. To determine the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, the overall purpose and context of the CCB cannot be ignored and the IRPA cannot be applied in a vacuum.\n[73] Ultimately, the process is such that Parliament directs the reader from the primary regime to another regime, but only so far as it approaches the issue of defining \u201ctemporary resident\u201d, a concept more proximate to immigration law in this context than tax law. This ostensibly seeks consistency between legislation of the same law-making body and not the reverse.\n2. Text [74] The Appellants argue that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is ambiguous because, although section 122.6 refers to a temporary resident \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\u201d the IRPA does not contain a definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d.[31] While the IRPA sets out multiple methods of becoming a temporary resident, there is no indication that this is an exhaustive list.[32] The Court should not apply expressio unius (implied exclusion) to treat this as an exhaustive list.[33] Further, the IRPA itself has some confusing and inconsistent provisions regarding temporary residents.[34]\n[75] The Respondent argues that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not ambiguous.[35] The IRPA sets out a finite number of ways to acquire temporary resident status.[36] All these methods require a determination by an IO.[37] The IRPA does not contemplate that refugee claimants acquire temporary resident status; refugee claims are not handled by IOs.[38] While temporary residents, permanent residents, and refugees are able to remain in Canada for a specific period, refugee claimants are subject to a conditional removal order until their claim is heard and a determination is made.[39]\n[76] It is true that there is no singularly identifiable definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d in the IRPA or an explicitly exhaustive list of methods to receive or achieve temporary resident status. This likely relates to the total absence of refugee claimant designation status from the IRPA.\n[77] The Court finds consistency in the legislative approach. Refugee claimants pursue an entirely different process for a status which is not determined by IOs. The IRPA\u2019s notation on relevant documents that refugee claimants do not receive temporary resident status through work and student permits also supports this conclusion. This is consistent with the decision in Almadhoun when expressed as follows:\n[18] \u2026 The IRPA provides a process for the determination of temporary residency, which is not an open and flexible category. In the appellant\u2019s submission however, she met the conditions required to be considered as a \u201ctemporary resident\u201d as a result of having been issued a Refugee Protection Claimant Document.\n[19] The problem with this argument is that the IRPA temporary resident regime explicitly requires the conferral of temporary residency by an immigration officer. \u2026\n[21] \u2026 there is no such thing as a de facto temporary resident status. \u2026 [40]\n[78] Lastly, the ITA does not reference a temporary resident \u201cas defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,\u201d but rather a temporary resident \u201cwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\u201d In turn, this legislatively directs that the meaning is discernible in the legislation.\n[79] As a result, the Court finds that the plain and ordinary interpretation of the text of the ITA is that the meaning of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d status is found within the IRPA. Although the IRPA does not explicitly define temporary resident, it is clear from a plain reading that an individual can only become a temporary resident when an IO confers that status according to the legislation. Since the legislation does not provide for IOs or others to confer temporary resident status on refugee claimants, refugee claimants are not temporary residents within the meaning of the IRPA.\n3. Context and Purpose [80] Given the distinction between the domestic legislative history and the treaty obligation under the CRC, each will be analyzed separately.\nLegislative History [81] The Appellants claim that various government documents and speeches show that the CCB was created with the intention to help families, especially those of low income, with the cost of raising their children. This is uncontroverted. Further, the Appellants argue that Parliament did not intend to exclude refugee claimants. Rather, Parliament intended to include everyone who is legally entitled to stay in Canada. Refugee claimants are legally entitled to stay in Canada.[41]\n[82] The Respondent argues that Parliament intended to leave out refugee claimants from the CCB program. Refugees, per se, were not initially included in the legislation, but amendments incrementally included refugees and other people in \u201crefugee-like\u201d situations.[42] However, refugee claimants were never included. Parliament had ample time to include refugee claimants if it so desired and it did not.[43]\n[83] Parliament\u2019s intention is likely revealed by its approach. The legislative history shows a general goal of helping parents with the cost of raising their children and alleviating child poverty. It is clear that Parliament intentionally amended eligibility for the CCB to include certain of those with varying immigration status. There is no mention of refugee claimants, despite the eligibility being specifically extended to refugees (post immigration assessment). It is possible that this was an oversight but, on balance, it is more likely that refugee claimants were intentionally excluded. The text of the provision further supports this. If the inclusion of refugee claimants was intended, it would have been more simple to state that an \u201celigible individual\u201d is anyone who otherwise qualifies and is legally domiciled or \u201centitled to stay\u201d in Canada, rather than to use the chosen, but more exclusive, and perhaps more cumbersome categories of individuals listed in subparagraphs (e)(i) to (e)(v) of s. 122.6.\nInternational obligation and the CRC [84] The Appellants cite the 1992 budget speech, which explicitly linked the CCB to the CRC.[44] They argue that legislation is presumed to comply with Canada\u2019s international obligations. As a result, the Intervenor also stressed that the CRC creates an obligation for Canada to ensure that children have access to social security and social insurance sufficient to meet their developmental needs. Each child, regardless of their own nationality or the nationality of their parents, should be granted these rights.[45]\n[85] The Respondent claims that international obligations cannot override clear statutory language.[46]\n[86] There is a presumption that legislation conforms to international law. This means that \u201ccourts will strive to avoid construction of domestic law pursuant to which the state would be in violation of its international obligations, unless the wording of the statute clearly compels that result.\u201d[47]\n[87] Canada has committed to protecting all children, including children of refugee claimants, by signing the CRC. However, there is little ambiguity upon which one can conclude that Parliament inadvertently misaligned its specific legislative enactment with its treaty obligations. The wording of the statute clearly compels the result that refugee claimants are excluded from the CCB because the legislation does not define them as persons entitled to unconditionally remain in Canada.\ne) Conclusion to Part A [88] There are no new legal issues raised. There has been no significant development in the law that was not otherwise previously before the FCA; Almadhoun is binding precedent on this Court. Even if Almadhoun is not binding, the constructive definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d is not ambiguous. Refugee claimants are not and were not intended to be temporary residents \u201cwithin the meaning of\u201d the IRPA.\n[89] The legislative history points to an overall goal of alleviating child poverty and assisting parents to pay for necessities. However, Parliament may set specific eligibility criteria for the CCB, including those grounded in degree, length and certainty of residency. Such foundational logic embeds common sense at its root. Even those unfamiliar with the text, context, and purpose of the legislation grasp why it is logically so. The wording of the paragraph and the multitude of amendments to the eligibility criteria suggest that Parliament was quite deliberate; it did not intend to allow anyone without a defined legal status and established nexus to Canada to receive the CCB, regardless of its obligations under the CRC.\nIV. PART B \u2013 THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE A. Sections 1 and 15 of the Charter Have the Charter rights of Ms. Yao or Ms. Zhang under s. 7 or subsection 15(1) been violated and, if such a violation has occurred, is such a violation not justified under s. 1 of the Charter?\n[90] The excerpts from the Charter are relatively short; they are, however, ladened with nuance and covered by extensive legal interpretation.\n[91] Section 7 of the Charter provides:\n7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[92] Section 15 of the Charter provides:\n15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\nPreliminary Issue re: Notice of Constitutional Question\n[93] During the portion of the hearing in October 2022, an issue arose among counsel and was raised with the Court. It concerned the sufficiency of the original notice of constitutional question sent to the provincial Attorneys-General. Specifically, the original notice referenced whether the \u201cimmigration status\u201d as an eligibility requirement in the ITA violated the section 7 and 15 rights of the Appellants and their children. Counsel noted that submissions and argument up to that point had narrowed the status further to that of \u201crefugee claimant status\u201d.\n[94] In order to alert the provincial Attorneys-General, a clarification letter was sent to each describing the more refined status, a summary of where the appeals stood and an invitation to each Minister of the Crown to advise the Court and counsel should any now wish to make submissions concerning the sub-category of immigration status: refugee claimant. None accepted the offer.\nB. Summary of Expert Evidence [95] The background and certified area of expertise for each expert who testified before the Court are as follows:\nFor the Appellants:\nExpert Witness\nEducation and\/or Background\nCertified Area of Expertise\nMr. John Stapleton\nBA and MA in Sociology\nExpert in the historical context and development of federal and provincial income security benefits for children and families with children in Canada\nDr. Grace-Edward Galabuzi\nMA and PhD in Political Science\nExpert in race and gender-based income inequality and public administration in poverty reduction\nDr. Luin Goldring\nMS and PhD in Sociology\nExpert in the subject of the sociological experience of newcomers to Canada, in particular those with precarious legal status\nDr. Leslie Roos\nPhD in Psychology\nExpert on the psychological effects of poverty and stress on children\u2019s mental, neurological and endocrine health and development\nFor the Respondent:\nExpert Witness\nEducation and\/or Background\nCertified Area of Expertise\nDr. Andrew Sharpe\nFounder of the Centre for the Study of Living Standards\nExpert in economics and economic statistics.\n[96] Clear from all expert testimony was that each expert for the Appellants felt strongly that the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB was, at the very least, a regrettable oversight, whether advertent or inadvertent. To that extent, they were biased. In today\u2019s political and media-dominated climate, perhaps only within a court\u2019s sterile environment, if even then, can those involved in social benefits policy not have a telegraphed viewpoint. In any event, this was identified for and by the Court several times. It is not a question of forgetting or ignoring any such bias, but properly characterizing it: a strong preference for policy change in their field. Consequentially, calibrating the weight of the reports, and not excluding the witnesses, was the chosen path of the Court.\n[97] From the evidence, no expert witness was immune to having used partial, dated or parsed data. More specific references are made subsequently throughout these reasons. Repeated and recurring comments, views and opinions marched along with observations regarding the CCB, immigration to Canada and the refugee and claimant process. To be specific, the Appellants\u2019 experts made such statements. For example, Dr. Galabuzi used outdated census data; cut and pasted a previous affidavit; and selected more general groups where more specific sub-category data were available. Dr. Goldring rarely referred to refugee claimants; understated available government programs; and failed to analyze data contrasting groups by sex.\n[98] Dr. Roos used US-based research without clarifying that source in her evidence; was incorrect about access of refugee claimants to healthcare, generally; and utilized outdated data. Mr. Stapleton\u2019s testimony as a \u201csocial benefit designer\u201d was anecdotal; untied to the underlying legislation; and provided evidence on economics, an area in which he was not qualified.\n[99] The Respondent\u2019s expert witness also unintentionally salted the numbers; Dr. Sharpe cut and pasted excerpts from other reports, and he asked and answered questions not otherwise posed.\n[100] Despite these lapses of reliability, from such expert testimony, the following were the balanced, weighted and proportional conclusions extracted by the Court:\n(a)the qualifications for the CCB and the previous iterations of the benefit have consistently included both a prerequisite durational and connective tenure;\n(b)refugee claimants are desperately and markedly poor when they enter Canada;\n(c)there is an income gap between immigrants and longstanding residents in Canada; however, the income gap closes after entry and narrows as time spent living and working in Canada by immigrants passes;\n(d)the majority of refugee claimants and immigrants in Canada are from the Global South and are racialized persons or visible minorities;[48]\n(e)there are no precise data on refugee claimants per se, and so proxies of those with precarious legal status were used to infer conclusions which it was advanced such unavailable data might otherwise reveal;\n(f)there are multiple benefit programs for refugee claimants in Canada from all levels of government; these programs are sometimes duplicative and work at cross-purposes;\n(g)poverty impacts children negatively in social, developmental and ultimate outcomes;\n(h)direct cash transfer benefits, such as the CCB, help parents and children because they constitute a consistent or predictable financial support;\n(i)refugees who are women have measurably lower income levels than others, including male refugees; and,\n(j)women refugee claimants are enumerated as parents more frequently than male refugee claimants.\n[101] None of these conclusions are particularly surprising. Many such conclusions, if they had not been adduced in testimony, could simply be logically and knowingly observed through judicial notice. While overall the quality of expert testimony was less than stellar and not infrequently unrealiable, collectively, the factual summary drawn above provided the basis for conducting the Charter analysis.\nC. Section 7 [102] Section 7 protects fundamental personal rights of survival and existence: life, liberty and security of the person. The rights broadly protect against state or quasi-state action, or arguably controllable omission, which depraves the subject of those three rights, except where deprivation of the established right aligns with fundamental justice.\n[103] The Appellants argue that paragraph 122.6(e), which operates to exclude the Appellants from the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d and thus disentitles them from the CCB, deprives them and their minor children of their right to security of the person in a way that is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[49] The Appellants do not argue that their rights to life or liberty have been deprived.\n[104] The Respondent claims that the Appellants and their children are not deprived of their right to security of the person under s. 7 and that even if a deprivation of the Appellants\u2019 and their children\u2019s s. 7 rights is established, this was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[50]\n[105] To establish that there was a violation of s. 7, the Appellants must first establish that their interest falls within the ambit of s. 7. If it does, the Appellants then must show that the impugned law interferes with, or deprives them of, their life, liberty, or security of the person and that the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.[51]\n[106] Accordingly, there are three elements to resolve in this part: (i) whether the legislation affects an interest protected by the right to security of the person within the meaning of s. 7; (ii) whether excluding refugee claimants from the CCB constitutes a deprivation of that right by the state; and (iii) if the first two elements are established, whether this deprivation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\na) Does the legislation affect an interest protected by the right to security of the person? [107] The first step is to determine whether the right contended for \u2013in this case, refugee claimants\u2019 right to the CCB\u2013 garners. 7 protection.[52] This requires consideration of the content of the right to security of the person and the nature of the interests protected by s. 7.[53]\n1. Is the administration of justice implicated? [108] In Gosselin, Chief Justice McLachlin explained that the jurisprudence up to that time suggested that only certain kinds of deprivation of life, liberty and security of the person are protected by s. 7: those attributable to state action implicating the administration of justice.[54] The \u201cadministration of justice\u201d phrase refers to \u201cthe state\u2019s conduct in the course of enforcing and securing compliance with the law\u201d.[55]\n[109] The administration of justice can be implicated in a variety of circumstances: criminal processes, human rights processes, parental rights in relation to state-imposed medical treatment, parental rights in the custody process, and liberty to refuse state-imposed addiction treatment.[56]\n[110] The administration of justice is not patently or readily implicated in these appeals. The Chief Justice also held that it was not implicated in Gosselin. The issue in Gosselin was whether the right to security of the person included a particular level of governmental social assistance to meet basic needs. That is similar to the question in these appeals.\n[111] However, the Chief Justice disagreed that s. 7 protection must always be narrowly confined to state action implicating the administration of justice. She suggested that s. 7 could possibly apply to rights or interests wholly unconnected to the administration of justice. Accordingly, the extent to which and the situation where s. 7 applies outside the context of the administration of justice remains unsettled, or more precisely, until this time unattained.[57]\n[112] Further, the Chief Justice said that it was not necessary to provide an exhaustive definition of the administration of justice in Gosselin by stating that \u201c[t]he issue here is not whether the administration of justice is implicated \u2014 plainly it is not \u2014 but whether the Court ought to apply s. 7 despite this fact.\u201d[58]\n[113] Similarly, the issue in these appeals is whether the Court ought to apply s. 7 despite the fact that the administration of justice is not implicated. Uncertainty arises in this respect because the Appellants effectively ask this Court to impose a positive obligation on the state to provide a social benefit. Whether the Charter protects economic rights, or more specifically whether s. 7 protects a basic minimum of social assistance, has been the subject of considerable debate, and is described by proponents and legislative bodies as the \u201csocial charter\u201d.[59]\n2. Can s. 7 protection place a positive obligation on the state? [114] The Appellants say that they do not seek that a positive obligation be recognized pursuant to s. 7. However, the argument does just that; imposing a positive obligation is imposed on the state to provide a benefit. If exclusion from the CCB scheme is a deprivation, the right to be included is the implicit right that was denied. That is, if omission deprives an individual from a right, then inclusion confers it. As a result, the Appellants request that the Court should recognize presently that s. 7 can place positive obligations on the state; the Supreme Court has left the door open, and a fulsome evidentiary record is at the threshold in these appeals.\n[115] Gosselin, did not resolve whether s. 7 could be read to encompass economic rights. However, the Chief Justice commented that even if s. 7 could be read to protect economic rights, s. 7 has been interpreted as a restriction of the state\u2019s ability to deprive people of rights, not the placement of a positive obligation on the state.[60] However, the Chief Justice left the door open for a positive obligation of the state to sustain security of the person informed by special circumstances in the future.[61]\n[116] The Appellants argue that Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)[62] is an example of a case where the Supreme Court effectively mandated a positive right.[63] The Supreme Court unanimously found that a Quebec law prohibiting insurance for private medical care deprived the claimants of their security of the person. The Court found that although the Charter does not provide a freestanding right to healthcare, where the government puts a healthcare scheme in place, the scheme must comply with the Charter.[64] The Appellants argue that this was akin to a positive benefit and analogous to the case at bar: the government put in place a scheme designed to provide benefits intended to alleviate child poverty, and the scheme must comply with the Charter by not withholding these benefits from the Appellants in violation of the s. 7 or analogous rights.[65]\n[117] The Appellants\u2019 argument is flawed because the situations are not analogous. In Chaoulli, the government imposed an exclusive healthcare scheme on all citizens of the province, which caused delays in healthcare treatment, resulting in adverse physical and psychological consequences. Finding this law unconstitutional did not place a positive obligation on Quebec to legislate for adequate healthcare; it removed a law that curtailed citizens\u2019 access to adequate healthcare. On the contrary, in this case, the government put in place a law providing a benefit to certain people in Canada. The question is whether the government should be forced to extend that benefit to refugee claimants. This is a positive obligation to which the reasoning in Chaoulli does not apply.\n[118] Although s. 7 has not been interpreted to place a positive obligation on the state in the past, the Supreme Court conceives of such an interpretation in the future given that the \u201cliving tree\u201d doctrine is a part of Canada\u2019s constitutional landscape.[66] Therefore, this issue does not does not hinge on whether s. 7 can be interpreted to impose a positive right on the state to ensure security of the person, but on whether the novel application of s. 7 should be interpreted in such a way given the circumstances of this case.\n3. Does s. 7 place a positive obligation on the state in this case? [119] The appellant in Gosselin argued that a social assistance regime which set the base amount of welfare payable to persons under the age of 30 lower than the amount payable to those 30 years of age and over violated s. 7 of the Charter.[67] The appellant asked the Supreme Court to require Quebec to remove the age-based distinction so that those 30 years of age and older would receive the same amount as those under 30. The majority found that the factual record in Gosselin was insufficient to support the proposed interpretation of s. 7.[68] The trial judge did not find the appellant\u2019s statistical and expert evidence convincing, and there was a lack of other important evidence.[69] Further, the record contained no indication that the appellant could be considered representative of the class.[70] As a result, the factual record could not \u201csupport the weight of a positive state obligation of citizen support.\u201d[71]\n[120] The Appellants argue that the relevant evidence from the Appellants and experts demonstrates that denying access to the CCB prevented the Appellants from meeting their basic needs.[72] Dr. Sharpe, in particular, confirmed that during their first few years in Canada, refugee claimants are, on average, desperately poor (women in particular).[73] This Court does not disagree that the Appellants had difficulty meeting their basic needs upon arriving in Canada and that they experienced financial hardship while awaiting refugee status, but this alone does not warrant the application of a novel interpretation of s. 7. For it to be possible for s. 7 to be applied in this way, the Appellants ought to have provided convincing statistical and expert evidence showing that their hardship warrants a positive obligation on the state to provide refugee claimants with childcare benefits.\n[121] Ultimately, s. 7 does not impose a positive obligation on the state concerning security of the person based upon individual economic need where generally a program otherwise creates broad economic benefits without violating the principles of fundamental justice. The evidence must be grounded in deprivation of the guaranteed right, not upon imputed economic amelioration based upon a sooner qualification to increased payments. These temporary, or at least finite, hardships of the Appellants and their children fail to meet the threshold set by the Supreme Court as a violation of the guaranteed right to security of the person. While this ends the s. 7 analysis, the Court pursues the balance for completeness.\n[122] The economic hardship of refugee claimants is lamentable and demonstrable. Their needs are great, but a guarantee to a certain benefit ought not to be a judicially created economic benefit masquerading as a constitutional right to security of the person. Properly assigned, it is the elected representatives within Parliament who should change and enhance the economic benefit if they deem fit, within their constitutionally assigned role as managers and payors of the public purse. Judicially created economic benefits under the ITA derogate from the democratic political process embedded through taxation by elected representation and its emblematic participation by citizens.\n4. Conclusion [123] The financial benefit of the CCB is not a deprived right. The non\u2011qualification for the CCB is not linked to the right to security of the person; the state is not legislating to deny or curtail an existing right. The scheme relates to taxation and benefits; the CCB falls within an economic calculation extracted from the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return form promulgated under the ITA. That is the very legal reason that it is before this Court.\n[124] Concerning distribution and redistribution of economic benefits, Parliament, if not given deference in such areas, shall be constrained and fettered by an ever-expanding judicially determined and coined economic \u201ccharter\u201d which applies where \u201csecurity of the person\u201d becomes a key to such a guaranteed \u201cread-in\u201d positive economic emolument despite Parliament\u2019s determination that it not be so. This would convert an economic need to a constitutional right, based upon judicially determined subjective need, anxiety and stress.\n[125] The Appellants provided insufficient evidence to prove, on balance, that the hardship experienced by refugee claimants upon entry to Canada is severe enough to warrant a novel interpretation of s. 7. As a result, the legislation does not affect an interest protected by the right to security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter.\nb) Does the exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB deprive the Appellants of their right to security of the person? [126] Security of the person is engaged by \u201cstate interference with an individual\u2019s physical or psychological integrity, including any state action that causes physical or serious psychological suffering\u201d.[74] It provides for personal autonomy involving control over one\u2019s bodily integrity free from state interference.[75] The issue at this stage is whether the exclusion of refugee claimants from the definition of \u201ctemporary resident\u201d deprives refugee claimants of their security of the person.\n[127] The Appellants argue that by denying their eligibility to the CCB, the state deprived them and their minor children of a benefit necessary for human life and survival, which in turn deprives them of their security of the person. The Appellants\u2019 argument centres on the evidence, claiming that it reveals that access to the CCB improved the lives of the Appellants and their children, and that denial of access to the CCB caused both physical and psychological harm. The Appellants argue that there is a sufficient causal connection between the deprivation of the CCB and the poverty experienced by the Appellants because the Supreme Court has mandated a broad approach to causation under s. 7.\n[128] The Respondent argues that the Appellants have not been deprived of their security of the person because the state has not interfered with the Appellants\u2019 physical or psychological integrity.[76] Any physical and psychological hardship experienced by the Appellants arose mainly from their difficult financial situations that began before they applied for and received the CCB.[77] For a deprivation to be made out under s. 7, there must be a \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d between the harm experienced and the impugned law, of which there is none in this case. The Appellants\u2019 poverty existed before and independently of their eligibility for the benefit.[78]\n1. Is the psychological harm serious and profound? [129] The right to security of the person protects the physical and psychological integrity of the individual.[79] This right does not protect an individual from the ordinary stresses and anxieties that a person of reasonable sensibility would suffer from government action.[80] To establish an infringement of security of the person, the claimant must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the state conduct in issue:\n\u2026 [had] a serious and profound effect on a person\u2019s psychological integrity. The effects of the state interference must be assessed objectively, with a view to their impact on the psychological integrity of a person of reasonable sensibility. This need not rise to the level of nervous shock or psychiatric illness, but must be greater than ordinary stress or anxiety.[81]\n[130] The Appellants argue that they and their minor children were deprived of their security of the person by denial of the CCB, a benefit necessary for human life and survival.[82] Receiving the CCB and then losing it affords analysis of both situations: the period while they received the benefit and the period after they lost it. The CCB was the difference not between life and death, but between grinding poverty and a more stable standard of living: security of the person.[83]\n[131] Ms. Zhang testified that the receipt of the CCB alleviated her poverty and allowed her to purchase essentials. She also described the effects of no longer receiving the CCB, including the effects on her and her children\u2019s mental health.[84] Ms. Yao testified to the effect of having and then losing access to the CCB.[85] Both Appellants testified that in addition to allowing them to provide the necessities of life, the CCB enabled them to provide their children with enhanced opportunities. It is not unreasonable that these additional activities could improve child development in the long term.[86]\n[132] A factual witness on the plight of refugee claimants testified. Mr. Meagher testified to the deep levels of poverty faced by refugee claimants with whom he works. [87] He described how many refugee claimants rely on social assistance to survive. He also explained that ineligibility for the CCB pushes refugee claimants into deeper levels of poverty.[88]\n[133] Depriving the Appellants\u2019 minor children of the CCB exposes them to the negative effects of poverty to the fullest degree, which could be mitigated or eliminated by access to the CCB.[89] The withholding of the CCB contributes to the significant and potentially permanent negative effects of poverty. Dr. Roos testified to the effect that poverty has on children. Direct cash transfers, such as the CCB, can improve child well-being.[90]\n[134] Despite the findings above, being excluded from the CCB does not rise to the necessary threshold. Without the CCB, the Appellants were able to secure the means necessary for human life and survival in a multitude of ways.[91] Any impact resulting from the Appellants\u2019 poverty was not permanent and was mitigated by their eventual eligibility for the CCB.[92]\n[135] In Scheuneman,[93] the Federal Court determined that the suspension of Canada Pension Plan disability benefits, which served as partial income replacement, did not cause psychological stress at a level that would breach s. 7.[94] The Supreme Court explained the following regarding this issue in G(J):\n\u2026 It is clear that the right to security of the person does not protect the individual from the ordinary stresses and anxieties that a person of reasonable sensibility would suffer as a result of government action. If the right were interpreted with such broad sweep, countless government initiatives could be challenged on the ground that they infringe the right to security of the person, massively expanding the scope of judicial review, and, in the process, trivializing what it means for a right to be constitutionally protected. \u2026[95]\n[136] While the mental health of the Appellants and their children was impacted, this does not constitute a \u201cserious and profound effect\u201d as described within G(J) and pertaining to s. 7. Ordinary stress and anxiety are not sufficient, including, even when government action causes those present, ordinary stresses and anxieties.\n2. Is there sufficient casual connection? [137] The Appellants must not only prove that they experienced serious psychological harm, but also that it resulted from the conduct of the state.[96] In other words, there must be a causal link between the impugned state conduct and the Charter violation claimed. This connection can be established by a reasonable inference on a balance of probabilities, and does not require that the impugned law be the only or dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant.[97] A causal connection exists where the state action is a foreseeable and necessary cause of the prejudice, but this is not the only way to establish causation.[98] The burden of establishing this connection is on the Appellants. The Supreme Court in Bedford cautioned that although mere speculation is not sufficient, setting the bar too high would risk barring meritorious claims.[99]\n[138] If the Appellants have been deprived of their security of the person, is there a sufficient causal connection between the deprivation and the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d? It is clear that the CCB eligibility requirements are not the only or primary cause of the Appellants\u2019 poverty. However, it is not necessary to determine if the requirements are the dominant cause.\n[139] The Supreme Court has mandated a broad approach to causation under s. 7 and to the test of whether the \u201csufficient causal connection\u201d standard has been met. The evidence demonstrates that the Appellants\u2019 security of the person was enhanced while receiving the CCB, and deprived once they lost access to the CCB.[100] Potentially, the Appellants have moved beyond \u201cmere speculation.\u201d Receipt of the CCB improved their situations, and they suffered without it. A reasonable inference could be drawn that a sufficient causal connection exists between the requirements and the Appellants\u2019 poverty. The bar must not be set too high.\n[140] Other factors are at play: is ineligibility for the CCB a cause of the Appellants\u2019 poverty, if only a meaningful partial cause? If so, arguably, poverty in Canada is at least partially perpetuated or sustained by the state; poverty could be alleviated if the government provided \u201csufficient\u201d financial assistance. Equally, Parliament chose to provide the CCB, which the Appellants would otherwise have been able to receive but for the unattained residency requirements in the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d. Overall, \u201c[a] sufficient causal connection is sensitive to the context of the particular case \u2026 .\u201d[101]\n[141] The novel finding of a positive element to s. 7 colours this context. The sufficient causal connection requirement sits differently from other cases.\n[142] Any physical or psychological hardships experienced by the Appellants were initially caused by their difficult financial or domestic situations subsisting before applying for the CCB, which were not caused, perpetuated or worsened by the Canadian state before or after entry. The Appellants\u2019 poverty existed before and independently of their ineligibility for the CCB.[102]\n[143] The world\u2019s largest totalitarian communist regime, the People\u2019s Republic of China, created the intolerable situation and justification for which the Appellants needed to flee China, and to apply for and ultimately receive full refugee status. The legislation that creates that critical beneficial environment, arguably essential to the life, liberty and\/or security of each Appellant\u2019s person, is the very piece of legislation now maligned, the IRPA. Moreover, the ITA incorporates the IRPA to employ the durational and qualitative connection necessary for the Appellants to qualify for the CCB when they become Convention refugees, and simply not before that point.\nc) Is the deprivation in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice? [144] The three central principles of fundamental justice recognized in the jurisprudence are arbitrariness, overbreadth, and gross disproportionality.[103] The analysis of these principles involves comparison with the object of the law that is challenged.[104] This analysis does not consider the law\u2019s effectiveness.[105]\n[145] The first step is to identify the object of the impugned law.[106] The object of the impugned law must be defined precisely for the purposes of s. 7; the \u201cdirect target of the measure\u201d must be identified.[107] Defining the objective too broadly would make it difficult to determine if the means used to further it are overbroad or grossly disproportionate.[108]\n[146] At this stage, competing social interests and public benefits conferred by the impugned law are not relevant. These factors should instead be considered under the s. 1 analysis.[109]\n[147] The Supreme Court described how to characterize Parliament\u2019s purpose in a s. 7 analysis regarding overbreadth in Moriarity.[110] More recently, the Court explained that:\nThe most significant and reliable indicator of legislative purpose would, of course, be a statement of purpose within the subject law. Beyond that, generally, courts seeking to identify legislative purpose look to the text, context, and scheme of the legislation and extrinsic evidence, which can (subject to the caution we offer below) include Hansard, legislative history, government publications and the evolution of the impugned provisions \u2026 .[111]\n1. Arbitrariness [148] A law is arbitrary where there is no rational connection between its object and the limit that it imposes on life, liberty or security of the person. An arbitrary law is not capable of fulfilling its objectives.[112]\n2. Overbreadth [149] A law is overbroad where it is arbitrary in part; it is \u201cso broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose.\u201d In this situation, there is no rational connection between the purpose of the law and some, but not all, of its impacts.[113] The law may be rational in some cases, while overreaching in its effect in others. However, \u201c[d]espite this recognition of the scope of the law as a whole, the focus remains on the individual and whether the effect on the individual is rationally connected to the law\u2019s purpose.\u201d[114]\n3. Gross disproportionality [150] The gross disproportionality inquiry compares the law\u2019s purpose with its negative effects on the rights of the claimant in order to determine if the impact is \u201ccompletely out of sync with the object of the law\u201d.[115] The standard for gross disproportionality is high.[116]\n[151] Further, the number of people who experience grossly disproportionate effects is not relevant; \u201ca grossly disproportionate effect on one person is sufficient to violate the norm.\u201d[117]\n[152] Arbitrariness and overbreadth are the two principles of fundamental justice present before the Court is these appeals. These issues turn on the purpose of the eligibility requirements.\n[153] The Appellants argue that the purpose of the requirements ensures that those in receipt of the CCB have meaningful, but not necessarily permanent, connections to Canada. In that case, it may be arbitrary to exclude refugee claimants who have resided in Canada for at least 18 months, and who may have formed many meaningful connections to Canada during that time, including bearing children who are legally Canadians by birth on Canadian soil.\n[154] On the other hand, the purpose of the requirements is to exclude anyone whose legal attachment to Canada is uncertain. Fairly put, the stay of a refugee claimant in Canada is transient and uncertain in the sense that a claim may be rejected at any point and the claimant is de jure subject to a conditional removal order which compels the person to leave the country upon notice, regardless of the connections that this person has formed in the meantime.\n[155] The Appellants assert that Vriend[118] stands for the proposition that the measureable durational purpose of the legislative regime should be considered and preferred. However, this is contrary to the jurisprudence that explains that it is the \u201cdirect target\u201d of the impugned measure that is relevant at this stage of the analysis. The impugned measure is the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d in paragraph 122.6(e) of the ITA, not the CCB regime as a whole.\n[156] Vriend was decided under s. 15, not s. 7. At the cited paragraph, Justice Iacobucci was undertaking a s. 1 analysis. That being said, a s. 1 analysis requires a rational connection, similar to a s. 7 arbitrariness analysis. However, Justice Iacobucci was trying to discern the objective of the omission, not whether there was a rational connection.\n[157] It is also difficult to rely on Justice Iacobucci\u2019s analysis as analogous because the government in Vriend did not provide any object for the omission: it argued that only the overall goal of the legislation needed to be examined. Therefore, the state failed the s. 1 analysis for want of pressing and substantial objective.[119] Justice Iacobucci did continue the analysis and found that there was no rational connection, but that was only assuming \u201csolely for the sake of the analysis, that the [government] correctly argued that where the objective of the whole of the legislation is pressing and substantial, this is sufficient to satisfy the first stage of the inquiry under s. 1 of the Charter.\u201d[120]\n[158] The Court accepts that the purpose of the requirements is to exclude those without the requisite legal attachment to Canada from the CCB. It can be argued that the requirements appear overbroad in that they may prevent children who are Canadian citizens, and whose strong connections to Canada are clear, from benefiting from the CCB. However, this is also true of such Canadian children awaiting the otherwise unchallenged 18-month period.\n[159] Ultimately, the Court is left with a view that the more refined and precise rationale of the impunged section and the definition of \u201celigible individual\u201d is hybrid in nature.\n[160] This two-pronged feature appeared from all legislative expert witnesses who referenced the tension in the evolved definition between longstanding and meaningful presence versus temporary and more permanent legal rights to stay. In conclusion, duration and certainty of tenure march hand in hand as twin objects.\nd) Section 7 Summary [161] Ultimately, Parliament created the CCB and its predecessor programs as an economic benefit to foster and assist the long-term health and development of children resident in Canada during parental rearing. The implication of the administration of justice is not proximate to that right. The Supreme Court has yet to settle the extent to which s. 7 applies outside the context of the administration of justice. The CCB is not a constitutional right; it is not justiciable.\n[162] For the CCB, the heart of this duality embraces two concepts for qualification: a durational measure of 18 months and a qualitative measure of residential certainty, namely, achievement of temporary resident status or greater. These two thresholds qualify one for the economic right, the CCB.\n[163] The CCB is first and foremost a negative assessment under the ITA; refundable benefits and credits created by the ITA are negative taxes. The FCA has spoken on this: an assessment, and by deduction a negative assessment, under the ITA cannot deprive the subject of security of the person.[121]\n[164] The objectives of the IRPA, in combination with the ITA, are rationally connected to the durational and qualitative thresholds required to create a suitable CCB regime; from its genesis, the CCB has used both duration of residency and degree of attachment to Canada in tandem, with legislative emphasis ebbing and flowing, as conjunctive measures or proxies. Preferring one over, or without, the other to achieve broader or sooner economic benefits is motivational reasoning.\n[165] A s. 7 Charter violation has not occurred in these appeals for compelling legal and factual reasons directly related to the CCB\u2019s nature, creation and context.\nD. Section 15 of the Charter [166] In order to establish a prima facie violation of s. 15(1), the claimant must demonstrate that the impugned law: (1) on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and (2) imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage.[122] Neither step of the analysis is concerned with whether the challenged law created the social, political, or legal disadvantage of protected groups.[123]\n[167] The two steps of the test should be kept distinct where possible, but in adverse effects cases, there is potential for overlap. As explained by the Supreme Court in Fraser, \u201c[w]hat matters in the end is that a court asks and answers the necessary questions relevant to the s. 15(1) inquiry, not whether it keeps the two steps of the inquiry in two impermeable silos.\u201d[124] More recently, the Supreme Court stated in Sharma that while the two steps are not watertight compartments and that there may be overlap in the evidence relevant at each step, the two steps ask fundamentally different questions. Therefore, each step must remain distinct from the other.[125]\n[168] After the claimant proves a s. 15(1) violation, the government can justify the distinction by demonstrating that the impugned law is ameliorative, and thus constitutional, pursuant to s. 15(2).[126] However, s. 15(2) is not typically mentioned if it is not relevant.[127] This Court observes that s. 15(2) is neither relevant nor before the Court in these appeals and therefore only an analysis of s. 15(1) follows:\na) Does the impugned law, on its face or in its impact, create a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds? [169] Step one of the s. 15(1) analysis asks the Court to determine whether a law, on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based upon an enumerated or analogous ground. In the case of direct discrimination, where the law makes a distinction on its face, identifying that distinction is relatively straightforward. In the case of adverse effects discrimination, the claimant must establish that the law creates a distinction in its impact.\n[170] The enumerated grounds are found in the text of s. 15(1): race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age and mental or physical disability.\n[171] Courts, specifically the Supreme Court, have expanded the enumerated grounds by creating, or revealing (depending on one\u2019s perspective) analogous grounds. Analogous grounds are implicitly read into the section. They are based on personal characteristics that are immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity. Recognized analogous grounds include sexual orientation, marital status, and citizenship.[128] Analogous grounds may be empirically immutable, such as sexual orientation, or constructively immutable, such as religion.[129] Once an analogous ground has been recognized, \"it stands thereafter as a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination\".[130]\n[172] It is no impediment that an analogous ground is limited to a subset of the Canadian population, as embedded analogous grounds \u201cmay be necessary to permit meaningful consideration of intra-group discrimination.\u201d[131]\n[173] In these appeals, the Appellants have made two s. 15 arguments: (1) direct discrimination on the basis of refugee claimant status, which they assert should now be recognized as an analogous ground; and (2) alternatively, adverse effects discrimination on the basis of race and\/or sex, which are enumerated grounds, through their exclusion under s. 122.6 of the ITA.\n1. Does the law, on its face, create a distinction on the basis of refugee claimant status? [174] The Appellants argue that by denying refugee claimants access to the CCB, s. 122.6 creates, on its face, a direct distinction based on refugee claimant status.[132] They claim that refugee claimant status should be recognized as a new analogous ground, and that there is no case law preventing the Court from reaching this conclusion.[133]\n[175] The Appellants say that two Corbiere factors militate in favour of establishing refugee claimant status as an analogous ground: refugee claimant status is immutable, very difficult to change, or changeable only at unacceptable personal cost; and refugee claimants are lacking political power and are disadvantaged and vulnerable.[134] Corbiere also shows that embedded analogous grounds may be necessary.[135]\n[176] According to the Appellants, refugee claimant status is functionally immutable because refugee claimants cannot change their status on their own unless they abandon their claim, which is an unacceptable personal cost.[136] Factually, refugee claims may take many years.[137]\n[177] Further, the Appellants argue that refugee claimant status is not a choice, which distinguishes their case from the Toussaint[138] decision. Choice was at the heart of the Toussaint analysis, where the FCA held that immigration status is not an analogous ground. Additionally, it is argued that the Toussaint case does not apply to refugee claimants because refugee claimants are not in Canada illegally, as the appellant was in Toussaint.[139]\n[178] The Appellants also argue that refugee claimants are disadvantaged in numerous ways and are vulnerable to having their interests overlooked. Refugee claimant status parallels citizenship as a ground of differential treatment. In Andrews,[140] the Supreme Court explained that relative to citizens, non-citizens are a group lacking in political power and are vulnerable to having their interests overlooked.[141] Refugee claimants: are more likely than others to experience deep poverty; may face limited, arbitrary, or no access to necessary benefits and services; and, are vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.[142] Further, they are disproportionately racialized and experience significant disadvantages based on race.\n[179] The Appellants recognize that a number of cases have concluded that immigration status is not an analogous ground, but they maintain that refugee claimant status is different. Almadhoun was decided without the benefit of Fraser, and comments in that case about s. 15 are obiter dicta.[143] Immigration status, in the abstract, includes people in a wide variety of circumstances. The Appellants must be considered in their unique, distinct circumstances.[144]\n[180] The Respondent relies on Toussaint, Irshad[145], and Li[146] for the proposition that immigration status is not an analogous ground. While the FCA did not specifically deal with refugee claimants in those decisions, this is not fatal because:\ni. in obiter, the FCA in Almadhoun saw no reason to reconsider immigration status in the particular context of refugee claimants;\nii. in Doctors for Care,[147] the Federal Court held that it was bound by decisions rejecting immigration status as an analogous ground to refugee claimants because immigration status includes refugee claimant; and\niii. in Kanyinda c Quebec (P-G),[148] the Superior Court of Quebec held that being a refugee claimant was not an immutable characteristic because being a refugee claimant is temporary.[149]\n[181] The Respondent further argues that even if immigration status does not cover refugee claimants, refugee claimant status is still not an analogous ground because being a refugee claimant is not an immutable characteristic.[150] Refugee claimant status can and does change, both because of a government decision or a personal choice.[151]\nAnalysis\n[182] When considering the identification of a new analogous ground, the main focus should be on whether the characteristic is immutable or constructively immutable. The Appellants claim that in Corbiere, the Supreme Court established four factors that inform whether a particular characteristic is an analogous ground: (1) whether the characteristic is fundamental; (2) whether the characteristic is immutable; (3) whether those with the characteristic are lacking in political power, disadvantaged, or vulnerable to having their interests overlooked; and (4) whether the characteristic is included in federal and provincial human rights codes.[152] However, these four factors come from the minority opinion, written by Justice L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9.\n[183] Justice McLachlin, as she then was, and Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, explained:\n\u2026 It seems to us that what [the enumerated ] grounds have in common is the fact that they often serve as the basis for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit but on the basis of a personal characteristic that is immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity. This suggests that the thrust of identification of analogous grounds \u2026 is to reveal grounds based on characteristics that we cannot change or that the government has no legitimate interest in expecting us to change to receive equal treatment under the law. To put it another way, s. 15 targets the denial of equal treatment on grounds that are actually immutable, like race, or constructively immutable, like religion. Other factors identified in the cases as associated with the enumerated and analogous grounds, like the fact that the decision adversely impacts on a discrete and insular minority or a group that has been historically discriminated against, may be seen to flow from the central concept of immutable or constructively immutable personal characteristics, which too often have served as illegitimate and demeaning proxies for merit-based decision making.[153]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[184] The Court is bound by the FCA\u2019s decision in Toussaint that immigration status is not an analogous ground. The same conclusion was reached by that Court earlier in Forrest,[154] which was later overruled in Tan,[155] but not on the issue of the absence of immutability.[156] Refugee claimant status is conceptually a subset of immigration status. Immigration status refers to whether a person is a non-immigrant, an immigrant, or a non-permanent resident. Refugee claimants are non-permanent residents while they await an IRB decision.\n[185] Under the IRPA, Parliament may treat people differently based on their immigration status (or lack thereof), so Parliament should also be able to do so in other legal regimes deploying that same definition. This is particularly true if the benefit or negative tax arises within the ITA. The Ontario Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized in Irshad[157] that where the constitutionality of Canada\u2019s immigration laws is not being challenged, a legislature may allocate social benefits based on immigration status.[158]\n[186] Even if this Court concludes that binding precedent on immigration status does not cover refugee claimants, refugee claimant status is still not an analogous ground. Admittedly, refugee claimant status is subjectively immutable such that refugee claimants cannot change it themselves (without abandoning their claim). However, by definition, refugee claimant status is entirely mutable: at some point, the claim will either be approved or denied and the individual will no longer be a refugee claimant. As a result, refugee claimant status can and does change, as it did for these very Appellants. Further, and with reference to the government having \u201cno legitimate interest in expecting us to change to receive equal treatment under the law\u201d, there are precise, detailed and prescribed governmental processes by which the very status of \u201crefugee claimant\u201d ought to and optimally will change.\n[187] Further, changing one\u2019s refugee claimant status does not come at an unacceptable cost to personal identity, as is the case with sexual identity, marital status, and citizenship. Refugee claimant status is not in itself tied to identity and refugee claimants all likely hope that their status indeed changes, ideally to that of refugee. Refugee claimants may abandon or withdraw their claims. Additionally, merely because a change in status is in the control of government agents does not make it immutable.[159] The ability to change personal characteristics is not a criterion within the test for immutability. To say that a refugee claimant has no choice but to stay in Canada is hindsight; the merits of the claim have not then been decided on that point.[160]\n[188] For these reasons, the Court concludes that the first part of the test is not achieved; refugee claimant status is not an analogous ground, and as a result, step one of the s. 15(1) test is not met.\n2. Does the law, in its impact, create a distinction on the basis of race and\/or sex? [189] The Appellants assert that because refugee claimants are predominantly racialized and women, s. 122.6 creates a distinction, in its impact, on the basis of race and sex. The provision is facially neutral or projects formal equality, but the exclusion of refugee claimants from CCB eligibility disproportionately impacts racialized people. The asserted distinction is on the basis of race, an enumerated ground.[161] Ample evidence demonstrates that refugee claimants are consistently and disproportionately visible minorities, and Dr. Sharpe explained that the country of origin is the best available indicator of refugee claimants\u2019 racialized status.[162] This is not a transitory phenomenon.[163] Implicitly, it is also the best indication of an immigrant\u2019s racialized status.\n[190] In addition to refugee claimants from Africa and Asia, claimants from the \u201cGlobal South\u201d are also likely visible minorities.[164] The Appellants assert that this case parallels the circumstances in Fraser and Flette.[165]\n[191] The Respondent argues that, considering the overall distribution of the CCB, the requirements do not have a disproportionate impact on racialized people. The Respondent further argues that racialized people are affected more by the requirements as a matter of chance.\nAnalysis\n[192] The asserted distinction is on the basis of race and sex, both enumerated grounds.[166] The CCB eligibility requirements exclude refugee claimants, and measurably more often women. Indeed, refugee claimants appear to be predominantly racialized, and race is a protected ground. Thus, the analysis need not contain a determination of an analogous ground. Instead, the analysis can move to a determination of adverse impact.\n[193] The Respondent acknowledges that racialized people face disadvantage, but systemic or historical disadvantage among racialized people is not in itself enough to show that the requirements have a discriminatory impact.[167]\n[194] In Fraser, the Supreme Court explained that in adverse effects discrimination cases, the first stage of the s. 15 test will be met if the law has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group.[168] As noted in Fraser, \u201cclaimants need not show that the criteria, characteristics or other factors used in the impugned law affect all members of a protected group in the same way.\u201d[169] Rather, adverse effects discrimination occurs \u201cwhen a seemingly neutral law has a disproportionate impact on members of groups protected on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground\u201d.[170] As the Supreme Court explained at paragraph 34:\n\u2026 the application of \u201cneutral\u201d rules may not produce equality in substance for disadvantaged groups. Membership in such groups often brings with it a unique constellation of physical, economic and social barriers. Laws which distribute benefits or burdens without accounting for those differences \u2026 are the prime targets of indirect discrimination claims. \u2026[171]\n[195] The majority in Sharma sought to bring clarity to the concept of adverse effects discrimination by discussing the standard by which courts should measure impact, and how claimants might prove impact.[172] In doing so, the Supreme Court stated that the first step of the s. 15(1) test examines whether the impugned law created or contributed to \u201ca disproportionate impact on a protected group, as compared to non-group members.\u201d[173] [emphasis in original] This involves drawing a comparison between the claimant group and other groups or the general population.[174] A \u201cmirror comparator group\u201d is no longer required as \u201c[i]t is unnecessary to pinpoint a particular group that precisely corresponds to the claimant group except for the personal characteristic or characteristics alleged to ground the discrimination.\u201d[175]\n[196] Causation is a central issue in step one.[176] The Court explained in Sharma that, at the first step, the claimant must \u201cpresent sufficient evidence to prove the impugned law, in its impact, creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on the basis of a protected ground\u201d (emphasis in original), and that causation is thus a central issue.[177] The majority in Sharma, citing Fraser, found that two types of evidence are helpful in proving causation: contextual evidence about the claimant group\u2019s situation, and evidence about the result of the law in practice.[178] While ideally a claimant would provide evidence of both, the evidentiary burden should not be unduly difficult to meet.[179] The majority confirmed that no specific form of evidence is required to prove causation, but Courts should \u201ccarefully scrutinize scientific evidence\u201d and only admit it where it has a reliable foundation.[180] Causation may be proved by a reasonable inference.[181]\n[197] Considering the overall distribution of the CCB, there is insufficient evidence that the requirements have a disproportionate impact on racialized women. The question in Fraser was whether the inability of participants in the job-sharing program to acquire full-time pension credit for their service, a rule which the employer applied to all job-sharers equally, had a disproportionate impact on women. The Court concluded that impugned measures had an adverse impact on women because the majority of people in job-sharing roles were women, but this was not the case for individuals in roles with other forms of job status, who obtained full pension rights.[182] Further, the Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Flette found that the first step of the s. 15 test was met because, inter alia, while the impugned measures applied equally to all children in care, the children in care were predominantly Indigenous. Therefore, the law had a disproportionate impact on Indigenous children.\n[198] The question in this case is whether the inability of refugee claimants to receive the CCB has a disproportionate impact on racialized people, who in the context of the CCB are mostly women. It is possible that the law creates a distinction on the basis of race, since refugee claimants are predominantly racialized people. However, in order to pass the test as set out in Fraser and \u201crefined\u201d in Sharma, the distinction must have a disproportionate impact on members of the protected group. The question therefore becomes whether there is evidence that excluding refugee claimants from the CCB significantly decreases the number of racialized people collecting the CCB. There is no evidence of this before the Court. There are many other groups beyond refugee claimants who are eligible for the CCB, and these groups, such as refugees, include a disproportionate number of racialized people.\n[199] Qualifying refugee claimants for the CCB might increase the absolute number of racialized people and women collecting the benefit (as it would be the absolute number per se), but no evidence suggests that it would measurably increase the proportion of racialized people and women collecting the CCB. Hence, deductively, one cannot have disproportional adverse impact, if reversing the qualification, thereby including refugee claimants, would not increase the proportion of racialized people collecting the benefit versus the proportion when just refugees qualify. The same logic applies to women, who in any CCB-receiving group form a large, constant and uncontroverted majority.\n[200] The qualification requirements of the CCB do not have a disproportionate impact on racialized individuals who have reached refugee or temporary resident status because the requirements do not prevent a racialized person from getting the CCB in that capacity. The statistical data bear this out. Racialized people receive the CCB at a proportion equal to, or, in fact, greater than, their representation within the Canadian population.[183]\n[201] Given the finding above, stage one of the two-part test is not reached. However, the Court will complete the stage two analysis on an alternative basis.\nb) Does the impugned law impose burdens or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating disadvantage? [202] This second stage of the analysis is similar for either direct or adverse impact discrimination. The objective is to examine the impact of the harm caused to the affected group, which may include economic exclusion or disadvantage, social exclusion, psychological harms, physical harms, or political exclusion. The harm \u201cmust be viewed in light of any systemic or historical disadvantages faced by the claimant group\u201d.[184] The law will be discriminatory if it widens the gap between the historically disadvantaged group and the rest of society, rather than narrows or is indifferent to it.[185] It becomes a larger comparator than the step one analysis.\n[203] The contextual factors relevant at the second step depend on the nature of the case.[186] Though they may assist at this stage of the s. 15 test, the presence of social prejudices and stereotyping are not necessary factors.[187]\n[204] At step two of the test, the claimant need not prove that the legislature intended to discriminate; judicial notice can play a role; and courts may infer that a law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage, where the inference is supported by the evidence.[188] Courts should also consider the broader legislative context.[189]\n1. Does the law reinforce, perpetuate or exacerbate disadvantage of refugee claimants? [205] The Appellants argue that denying refugee claimants the CCB discriminates by perpetuating and exacerbating the disadvantages faced by refugee claimants.[190]\n[206] Refugee claimants are a fundamentally disadvantaged group. A distinction that denies them a benefit because they are refugee claimants, a benefit that would otherwise be available to them, deepens their disadvantage relative to other Canadians.[191]\n[207] The evidence of Dr. Goldring, Dr. Sharpe, Mr. Meagher, and the Statistics Canada data demonstrate the measurable poverty of refugee claimants.[192] Mr. Meagher\u2019s testimony illustrates the difficulty faced by refugee claimants who are parents in providing for their family\u2019s basic needs, the exact type of disadvantage that the CCB was enacted to ameliorate.[193]\n[208] The CCB can make a measurable difference in the family\u2019 lives of refugee claimants. The Appellants\u2019 evidence illustrates the disadvantage faced by refugee claimants without access to the CCB, and the positive impact of receiving the benefit.[194]\n[209] The Appellants make a strong argument that the inability of refugee claimants to receive the CCB perpetuates and exacerbates their disadvantage. There are however some countervailing arguments, which in light of the decision in Sharma have certain weight. The permanent impact and contributory effect do not rise to the threshold necessary.\n[210] The temporary, or at least finite, ineligibility for the CCB does not have the permanent effects on the Appellants\u2019 well-being that the Appellants contend that it has. This evidence comes from Dr. Goldring, Dr. Galabuzi, and Dr. Roos, all of whom are advocates and are approaching unreliability in their deeply held conclusions. Their evidence that the denial of the benefit has permanent impact is not persuasive.[195]\n[211] The deprivation of the CCB is mitigated by open work permits, employment-related benefits, various federal non-refundable tax credits, primary and secondary education for refugee claimant children at no cost, the Interim Federal Health Program, and social assistance.[196] These other benefits soften the temporary ineligibility for the CCB.[197]\n[212] The broader constitutional and legal context supports the distinction made by the requirements. The constitutional context is that immigration status has so far not been recognized as a protected ground of discrimination. The legal context is that, as stated by the Supreme Court in Chieu,[198] Parliament may treat people differently based on immigration status. If that is the case under the IRPA, Parliament should also be able to make reasonable distinctions on this basis in other legal regimes.[199]\n[213] Ineligibility for the CCB is almost always temporary for refugee claimants, although the length of such status varies. Once a claim is accepted, the \u201cnew\u201d refugee becomes a protected person and qualifies for the benefit. Similarly, CCB ineligibility is even temporary for those whose claims have been withdrawn, have been abandoned, or have failed. These individuals will either leave the country, and therefore be ineligible for other reasons, or stay in Canada through a humanitarian and compassionate application and ultimately become entitled to the CCB.[200] No one permanently stays, or is intended to stay, in the refugee claimant category.\n2. Does the law reinforce, perpetuate or exacerbate disadvantage of racialized persons and women? [214] The Appellants contend that denying refugee claimants the CCB creates a distinction in its impact on the basis of race. Section 122.6 perpetuates the substantial disadvantages faced by refugee claimant mothers, who are predominantly racialized women.[201] Racialized women suffer economic disadvantages compared to nearly every other group.[202]\n[215] For racialized women with children, economic disadvantage is self\u2011perpetuating. A certain level of financial support is necessary. For many refugee claimants, their principal source of financial support is government assistance.[203]\n[216] Denying refugee claimants the CCB also exacerbates and perpetuates the disadvantages faced by their minor children, who are racialized children living in poverty. The experience of child poverty and precarity has lasting, even lifelong impacts.[204]\n[217] In addition, by approving the Appellants\u2019 CCB claims and providing the benefit for a time and then cutting off access and demanding repayment, the government\u2019s conduct in administering s. 122.6 did even more to perpetuate disadvantage than denying the benefit based on that provision itself.[205] Mr. Meagher testified that he has seen even government workers advise refugee claimants to apply for the CCB.[206]\n[218] The Appellants cite Stoffman for the proposition that the government\u2019s conduct in enforcing s. 122.6 is a freestanding ground that must be considered. It is true that in Stoffman the Supreme Court stated:\n\u2026 It is also clear that the \u201claw\u201d in question comprehends not just Reg. 5.04 alone, but the policy which is followed in its application to those who come within its terms as well. It would be incongruous if our entitlement to equality \u201cbefore and under the law\u201d and to the \u201cequal protection and equal benefit of the law\u201d did not reach the manner in which a law was interpreted and enforced by those charged with its operation. It will often be this process of interpretation and enforcement that determines the impact that a law has on the lives of those who come within its scope. \u2026[207]\n[219] However, the context of that case was different. Stoffman concerned the admitting privileges of physicians at a hospital. The impugned regulation provided that staff would be expected to retire in the year that they reached the age of 65, but those who wished to defer retirement could make a special application to a board of trustees. The policy of the board in implementing this regulation was that all physicians were expected to retire unless they had something unique to offer to the hospital. On this basis, most of the respondent physicians did not have their admitting privileges renewed upon turning 65.\n[220] The respondents in Stoffman argued that the regulation violated the Charter either by its terms or by the manner of its application.[208] The Supreme Court found that the regulation and the policy that the board adopted as a guide to its application came within the sphere of s. 15 of the Charter.[209]\n[221] The impact of the requirements does not include the method of administration, as argued by the Appellants. This is not a free-standing ground that must be considered when determining whether s. 122.6 is constitutional. Stoffman is wrongly relied upon in this context. The administration of the ITA is not relevant in determining the constitutionality of the provisions. Further, the ITA authorizes the government to provide the CCB and then ask for it back. The Appellants have not challenged the constitutionality of any of the relevant administrative provisions of the ITA. Finally, the conduct of the Minister or the CRA is not the proper subject matter for an appeal to this Court.\n[222] The Court is not in a position to make a finding of economic disadvantage applicable to all racialized groups who are women. Not all racialized groups are in the same economic position. In Tabingo,[210] a similar conclusion was reached by the Federal Court.[211] However, according to 2006 and 2016 census data utilized by the Appellants\u2019 experts, there are particular racialized groups that do better economically than non-racialized groups, female comparators included.[212] Further, there are wide variations among racialized groups in both average employment earnings and low-income rates. Even in lower-income deciles, there are instances where particular racialized groups do better than non-racialized groups.[213] These countervailing facts stare in the Court\u2019s face.\n[223] On an alternative basis, even if the eligibility requirements make a distinction based on the enumerated ground of race, they do not deny the benefit in a way that perpetuates, reinforces, or exacerbates disadvantage.[214]\nc) Section 15 Summary [224] The Appellants\u2019 claim that the CCB eligibility requirements infringe their section 15 rights fails. First, refugee status is not an analogous category. Toussaint is binding precedent in this respect, and even if no precedent existed, refugee status would not be an analogous ground because it is not immutable. Refugee claimant status can and does change, and such change does not come at a cost to one\u2019s personal identity.\n[225] Second, exclusion of refugee claimants from the CCB does not discriminate on the basis of race or sex. While a large portion of refugee claimants are racialized women, groups that presently qualify for the CCB include racialized women and those groups make up a significant portion of those eligible for the CCB. As a result, there is insufficient evidence that excluding refugee claimants from the CCB disproportionately affects racialized women receiving the benefit such that, as a whole, the CCB qualification requirements discriminate on the basis of race and\/or sex.\nE. Section 1 [226] Given that the Court need not consider it, the discussion concerning s. 1 shall be brief; the Court also cautions that it is moot. Consequently, it is observational.\n[227] Once the claimant has established an infringement of a Charter right, the burden shifts to the government to justify that infringement under s. 1 on a balance of probabilities.[215] Section 1 provides:\n1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n[228] The legal test for the application of s. 1 is known as the Oakes test. The government must establish that: (1) the law has a pressing and substantial objective; and (2) the means chosen are proportional to that object. The second step, the proportionality test, has three prongs that ask if: (i) the means adopted are rationally connected to that objective; (ii) the law is minimally impairing of the right in question; and (iii) there is proportionality between the deleterious and salutary effects of the law.[216]\n[229] In cases where s. 7 is infringed, the law may still be justified under s. 1.[217] It is difficult to justify a s. 7 violation, but there may be situations where the countervailing public good justifies depriving an individual of life, liberty, or security of the person.[218]\n[230] More importantly, the s. 1 analysis is distinct from and embarked upon once a stand-alone violation of a guarantee infringed right occurs; the test is whether that existing infringement may be justified. It is again noted that the Court\u2019s finding is that no violation has occurred in the first instance.\na) Does the law have a pressing and substantial object? [231] The object of the law must be sufficiently pressing and substantial to justify the infringement of a Charter right.[219] For a law\u2019s purpose to be pressing and substantial, that purpose \u201cmust be characterized in light of the requirements of the Oakes test to be of value\u201d. Too broad of a characterization will frustrate the purpose of the s. 1 analysis.[220]\n[232] Courts must be skeptical of using budgetary constraints to justify Charter infringements, but financial crises may provide exceptions.[221] As the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]o the extent that the objective of the law was to cut costs, that objective is suspect as a pressing and substantial objective under the authority in N.A.P.E.\u201d.[222]\n[233] The Respondent asserts that the objective of the eligibility requirements is to ensure that individuals receiving the CCB have the requisite legal attachment to Canada by excluding those whose attachment to Canada is transient or uncertain. This is a pressing and substantial objective. Canada should not be required to pay a social benefit to every person who enters the country.[223] The legislative history supports that this is the objective.[224]\n[234] Observationally, the Respondent has not meaningfully explained why ensuring CCB recipients have the requisite legal attachment to Canada is a pressing and substantial objective needed to override and justify a Charter violation, if one had occurred. Is it because expanding the scope of the benefit would lead to greater public expenditures? If so, the Supreme Court has cautioned against using budgetary constraints as a pressing and substantial objective.\n[235] Little of the evidence cited by the Respondent is attributable to Parliament\u2019s intent.[225] The Respondent would have failed to establish a pressing and substantial objective to justify a breach.\nb) Are the means chosen proportional to that object? 1. Rational Connection [236] The Respondent need only show that there is a causal connection between the infringement and the benefit sought on the basis of reason or logic.[226] The standard is not onerous.[227]\n[237] The stay of refugee claimants in Canada is uncertain given that their claims may ultimately be rejected. While the Appellants have made a balanced argument that refugee claimants have a sufficient attachment to Canada, the rationale for the exclusion is still rational, at least to the extent that it is logically linked to the objective.\n[238] The eligibility requirements render those, whose stay in Canada is transient or uncertain, ineligible for the CCB. Refugee claimant stays in Canada are uncertain and may be transient. Thus, there is a rational connection between the exclusion of refugee claimants and the objective.[228]\n[239] Under the IRPA, a refugee claimant is under a conditional removal order pending determination of their claim. By contrast, the statuses listed under paragraph 122.6(e) of the ITA confer a definite right or authorization to enter or remain in Canada.[229] The Appellants argue that a high acceptance rate demonstrates certainty. It is unclear how it does. These rates fluctuate.[230]\n[240] The Appellants argue that Canadian-born children do not have transient or uncertain connections to Canada. However, not all children of refugee claimants are Canadian.[231] Even if refugee claimant has children who are Canadian citizens, the exclusion is rationally connected to the objective. Entitlement to the CCB relates to the parent\u2019s status, as the parent is paid the benefit, not the child.[232] Further, granting the benefit to these children, as opposed to all, would be making a distinction based on citizenship, which is concerning.[233]\n[241] Proportionality does not require perfection and courts must afford the legislature a measure of deference.[234] A higher degree of deference should generally be afforded when considering a complex regulatory response to a social problem.[235]\n2. Minimal Impairment [242] The Supreme Court has explained that financial considerations alone cannot justify Charter infringements, but governments must be afforded wide latitude to determine the proper distribution of resources in society.[236] Determining entitlement to the CCB is a complex policy decision involving high government expenditures.[237]\n[243] The impact of the requirements is minimal because it is temporary if the refugee claims are ultimately accepted or immigration status is obtained by another route.[238] The impact is also limited because refugee claimants may obtain the benefit depending on the status of their spouse or common-law partner, the impact is mitigated by other benefits and programs, and there is no impact on the children of refugee claimants who are in institutional or foster care because those caregivers do not receive the CCB and instead receive a special allowance.[239]\n[244] Parliament has made a parent who lacks the requisite status eligible for the CCB when they have a partner who does have the requisite status. Parliament also decided to make temporary residents who live in Canada for at least 18 months eligible for the benefit. These decisions are the kind of line drawing that warrants deference to Parliament\u2019s role in managing complex circumstances and significant government expenditures.[240]\n[245] In Eldridge, the decision cited by the Respondent regarding government expenditures, the issue was whether a provincial government\u2019s decision to not fund medical interpretation services for the deaf when they received medical services violated s. 15 of the Charter. The Supreme Court found that s. 15 was infringed. In the s. 1 analysis, the Court assumed, without deciding that the objective of controlling healthcare expenditures was pressing and substantial, that the decision was rationally connected to the objective. The Court found that the decision did not constitute a minimum impairment:\nIn the present case, the government has manifestly failed to demonstrate that it had a reasonable basis for concluding that a total denial of medical interpretation services for the deaf constituted a minimum impairment of their rights. As previously noted, the estimated cost of providing sign language interpretation for the whole of British Columbia was only $150,000, or approximately 0.0025 per cent of the provincial health care budget at the time. \u2026 In these circumstances, the refusal to expend such a relatively insignificant sum to continue and extend the service cannot possibly constitute a minimum impairment of the appellants\u2019 constitutional rights.[241]\n[246] The Respondent cites the amount of money the government expends on the CCB. If this factor is determinative, the Respondent would need to provide an estimate concerning how much more the government would have to expend if refugee claimants who have been residing in Canada for at least 18 months were to become eligible for the benefit. Otherwise it is speculation.\n[247] The question is whether there are less harmful means of achieving the legislative goal; a court must determine whether the limit is reasonably tailored to the objective.[242] Restated: does the law \u201cfalls within a range of reasonable alternatives open to Parliament to achieve its objectives? If it is within this range, it should not fail the minimal impairment test merely because, in the Court\u2019s view, an alternative would have been better suited to the objective\u201d.[243]\n[248] The alternative measures need not satisfy the objective to exactly the same extent as the impugned measures, but must substantially achieve the challenged measures\u2019 objective.[244]\n3. Proportionality between deleterious and salutary effects [249] In balancing public versus private rights, \u201cthe Oakes analysis weighs the impact of the law on protected rights against the beneficial effect of the law in terms of the greater public good.\u201d[245] In Ndhlovu,[246] the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[b]enefits that are speculative and marginal in nature carry less weight when balanced against a measure\u2019s significant and tangible deleterious effects\u201d.[247]\n[250] The Respondent argues that the negative effects on refugee claimants whose claims are accepted is arguably partial or limited because they will be entitled to the CCB once their claims are accepted. The negative effect on failed claimants is not limited in this way, unless they obtain the requisite status another way, because failed refugee claimants must leave Canada.[248] Not everyone who enters the country should get a social benefit.[249] As such, the positive effects of the eligibility requirements outweigh any impact on the Charter rights of refugee claimants and their children.[250] Overall, had a violation occurred, the Respondent was short on the measurable public good attained by a Charter violation.\nc) Section 1 Summary [251] The Respondent has not explained what the positive effects of the eligibility requirements are. The Respondent has also not meaningfully dealt with the negative effects that the requirements have on refugee claimants. The fact remains that while the temporary nature of refugee claimant status is theoretically evident, it is empirically much more mediate in duration. Ultimately the Court would have, if necessary, have found that a public good could not in the case countermand the deleterious effect.\nF. Remedy [252] In light of the dismissal of the appeals, the issue of remedy need not be addressed. For completeness, the Court offers some observations.\n[253] The Court notes that the Respondent stated that no remedy was legally available to the Appellants should the Court have allowed the appeals. The Court disagrees.\n[254] While presently moot, these appeals strike the heart of the Court\u2019s exclusive and originating jurisdiction: the correctness of the assessments by the Minister under the ITA. It is precisely within the ITA that an answer is found.\n[255] Under subsection 171(1) of the ITA, the Court may dispose of an appeal by dismissing it, or allowing it and, if so, vacating, varying or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[256] The Court\u2019s reasons for disposition are distinct from its statutory power to grant relief or dismiss. If the Minister\u2019s assessments had been incorrect because of a faulty interpretation of the ITA under the IRPA in Part A, or because of Charter violations in Part B, it would be the reassessments disallowing the CCB which would be incorrect. Those errors would alter the assessment of tax for these taxpayers. In short, the Court\u2019s decision affects the Appellants\u2019 legal rights, as taxpayers. Other refugee claimants, taxpayers, if these appeals had been successful, might then have relied upon such precedent using the principle of stare decisis. For that reason, declaratory relief to invalidate the ITA and invoke subsection 24(1) of the Charter was not in issue because it would not have been needed to provide other taxpayers with a future remedy. In these specific matters, the appeals would have been allowed and the CCB then paid by the Minister.\n[257] In any event, as stated, this is moot given the outcome.\nV. COSTS [258] The parties addressed the issue of costs in passing only and the Court did not request submissions.\n[259] The complexity of the grounds of these two appeals hides their basic nature; these are and remain appeals for the denial of the CCB to two Appellants who a short time ago: fled a communist, totalitarian dictatorship; became refugee claimants, then refugees; and, are now Canadian citizens. Throughout, their near penury has been evident.\n[260] Similarly, counsel for the Appellants and Intervenor acted pro bono publico. The Court applauds this support by them for access to justice.\n[261] The Court\u2019s strong preference is that there be no costs awarded, despite the outcome, the Rules and precedent. If the parties feel strongly otherwise, then within 30 days, they may make submissions in writing. Otherwise, this cost direction shall become final after 30 days after the date of these two judgments.\nSigned at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 15th day of February 2024.\n\u201cR. S.

The Court in Sharma said that it was not altering the two-step test for s. 15, and just bringing clarity and predictability: at para 33. The bench split markedly on that point: Justice Karakatsanis raised just the opposite concerns in her dissent in Sharma (Justices Martin, Kasirer, and Jamal concurring). She explained that under the guise of \u201cclarity\u201d, the majority sought to revise the test. She stated that the revisions \u201care not only unsolicited, unnecessary, and contrary to stare decisis; they would dislodge foundational premises of our equality jurisprudence.

Spiro\u201d\nSpiro J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 2\nDate: 20240104\nDocket: 2021-1039(GST)APP\nBETWEEN:\nREFIND ENVIRONMENT INC.,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSpiro J.\n[1] This is an application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection against assessments under the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cETA\u201d).\n[2] The assessments related to nine reporting periods of the Applicant. The first set of reporting periods began on December 1, 2016 and ended on August 31, 2018. The second set began on December 1, 2018 and ended on May 31, 2019.\n[3] There is no dispute about two critical dates. First, there is no dispute about the date on which the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) sent notices of assessment to the Applicant. That date was November 27, 2019.\n[4] Second, there is no dispute about the date on which the Applicant filed with the Minister an application for an extension of time to object. That date was February 26, 2021.\n[5] It is also common ground that the Applicant did not file a notice of objection with the Minister within 90 days from the mailing date of the notices of assessment as required by subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA.\n[6] The only issue is whether the Applicant timely filed its application for an extension of time to object.\nPosition of the Crown\n[7] The Crown says the Applicant filed its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object one day late. On the Crown\u2019s theory, the last date on which the Applicant could have filed its application with the Minister was February 25, 2021.\nPosition of the Applicant\n[8] The Applicant says that the last date on which it could have filed its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object was one day later \u2013 February 26, 2021 \u2013 the date on which it actually filed its application.\nThe Excise Tax Act\n[9] Subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA allows 90 days from the mailing date of the notice of assessment to file a notice of objection. If one misses that deadline, paragraph 303(7)(a) allows an additional year to file an application with the Minister to extend time to object. If the Minister refuses the application one may proceed to the Court to grant the application but, under paragraph 304(5)(a), the Court cannot grant the application if it was not filed with the Minister within that additional year.\n[10] I have reproduced the relevant provisions in their statutory context [with emphasis added]:\nObjection to assessment\n301(1.1) Any person who has been assessed and who objects to the assessment may, within ninety days after the day notice of the assessment is sent to the person, file with the Minister a notice of objection in the prescribed form and manner setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts.\n***\nExtension of time by Minister\n303(1) Where no objection to an assessment is filed under section 301 \u2026 within the time limit otherwise provided, a person may make an application to the Minister to extend the time for filing a notice of objection \u2026 and the Minister may grant the application.\n***\nDuties of Minister\n303(5) On receipt of an application made under subsection (1), the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, consider the application and grant or refuse it, and shall thereupon notify the person of the decision by registered or certified mail.\n***\nWhen order to be made\n303(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ; and\n(b) the person demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting,\n(A) the person was unable to act or to give a mandate to act in the person\u2019s name, or\n(B) the person had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026 ,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted it to be made.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n304(1) A person who has made an application under section 303 may apply to the Tax Court to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) ninety days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 303(1) and the Minister has not notified the person of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of thirty days after the day the decision has been mailed to the person under subsection 303(5).\n***\nPowers of Court\n304(4) The Tax Court may dispose of an application made under subsection (1) by\n(a) dismissing it, or\n(b) granting it,\nand in granting an application, it may impose such terms as it deems just or order that the notice of objection or the request be deemed to be a valid objection \u2026 as of the date of the order.\nWhen application to be granted\n304(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ; and\n(b) the person demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for objecting,\n(A) the person was unable to act or to give a mandate to act in the person\u2019s name, or\n(B) the person had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment \u2026 ,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 303(1) as soon as circumstances permitted it to be made.\n[11] Two timing questions arise for consideration. The first relates to the 90\u2011day objection period and the second relates to the one-year application period.\nThe 90 Day Objection Period\n[12] The answer to the first timing question turns on the interpretation of subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA which sets out the 90-day deadline to file a notice of objection:\n301(1.1) Any person who has been assessed and who objects to the assessment may, within ninety days after the day notice of the assessment is sent to the person, file with the Minister a notice of objection in the prescribed form and manner setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts.\n[13] In its submissions, the Applicant places considerable emphasis on the word \u201cafter\u201d in the phrase in subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA which provides that a notice of objection must be filed within ninety days after the day that notice of the assessment is sent to the person.\n[14] The Applicant contends that the word \u201cafter\u201d means that the 90-day clock to file a notice of objection commences on the day after the Minister sent the notice of assessment. As the Minister sent notices of assessment to the Applicant on November 27, 2019, we should count the 90 days commencing on November 28, 2019.\n[15] In support of its position, the Applicant refers to subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act:\n27(4) Where a time is expressed to begin after \u2026 a specified day, the time does not include that day.\n27(5) Where anything is to be done within a time after \u2026 a specified day, the time does not include that day.[1]\n[16] The Crown agrees with that proposition.[2] I am satisfied that this reading of subsection 301(1.1) of the ETA reflects its proper interpretation.\n[17] The Applicant then argues that because the 90-day clock commenced on November 28, 2019 (the day after the mailing of the notices of assessment), the 90th day fell on February 26, 2020.[3] Under the Applicant\u2019s theory, the last day for filing a notice of objection would have been February 26, 2020.\n[18] The Applicant\u2019s computation of the 90-day objection period is wrong. If we start counting on the day after the mailing date of the notices of assessment, namely, on November 28, 2019, the 90th day actually fell on February 25, 2020. Because the notice of objection had to be filed within those 90 days, the deadline to file a notice of objection fell on February 25, 2020. That was the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection without having to apply for an extension of time.\n[19] Based on subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act, I am satisfied that February 25, 2020 was the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection with the Minister.\n[20] Now that we have established that date, how do we compute the one-year period to apply for an extension of time?\nThe One Year Application Period\n[21] The answer to the second timing question turns on the interpretation of paragraphs 303(7)(a) and 304(5)(a) of the ETA which set out the one year period for filing an application to extend time to object:\n303(7) No application shall be granted [by the Minister] under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n***\n304(5) No application shall be granted [by the Tax Court] under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n[22] We have already established that the last day on which the Applicant could have filed a notice of objection with the Minister was February 25, 2020.\n[23] The Applicant argues that the one-year application period should be counted starting the day after February 25, 2020. In that regard, it relies once again on subsections 27(4) and 27(5) of the Interpretation Act.\n[24] If the Applicant\u2019s theory is correct, the last day to file its application was February 26, 2021 \u2013 the day on which it was actually filed.\n[25] The Applicant\u2019s approach to the computation of the one-year application period is wrong. I agree with the Crown that February 25, 2021 was the last day on which an application to extend time to object could have been filed with the Minister.\n[26] The flaw in the Applicant\u2019s argument arises from conflating units of time. The provision dealing with the objection period uses the unit of a day to compute time. The provisions dealing with the application period use the unit of a year to compute time.\n[27] Subsection 37(1) of the Interpretation Act is the relevant provision where the benchmark is a year \u2013 not subsections 27(4) or 27(5). Subsection 37(1) of the Interpretation Act simply tells us that the expression \u201cyear\u201d means any period of twelve consecutive months.[4]\n[28] We now return to the provisions at issue:\n303(7) No application shall be granted [by the Minister] under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n***\n304(5) No application shall be granted [by the Tax Court] under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 303(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Part for objecting \u2026 ;\n[29] The expression \u201cwithin one year after the expiration of the time\u201d means exactly that \u2013 within one year after the expiration of the 90 days. The last date that falls within one year after February 25, 2020 is February 25, 2021.\nConclusion\n[30] The Applicant did not file its application with the Minister for an extension of time to object within the time required by paragraph 303(7)(a) of the ETA. I must, therefore, dismiss the Applicant\u2019s application and shall do so without costs. Finally, I am grateful to both counsel for their thorough oral and written submissions.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 4th day of January 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

It states:\nInsurable employment does not include\n\u2026\n(i) employment if the employer and employee are not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length.\n[5] In applying Paragraph 5(2)(i) one must take account of subsection 5(3) of that Act:\nFor the purposes of paragraph (2)(i),\n(a) the question of whether persons are not dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length shall be determined in accordance with the Income Tax Act; and\n(b) if the employer is, within the meaning of that Act, related to the employee, they are deemed to deal with each other at arm\u2019s length if the Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the employment, including the remuneration paid, the terms and conditions, the duration and the nature and importance of the work performed, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have entered into a substantially similar contract of employment if they had been dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length.\n(Emphasis added)\n[6] Subsection 251(1) of the Income Tax Act sets provides that:\nFor the purposes of this Act,\n(a) related persons shall be deemed not to deal with each other at arm's length;\n(b) \u2026 and[3]\n(c) in any other case, it is a question of fact whether persons not related to each other are, at a particular time, dealing with each other at arm's length.\n[7] There is no suggestion that the Appellant and Intervenor are related persons within the meaning of paragraph 251(1)(a). Accordingly, as directed by paragraph 251(1)(c) one must determine if the Appellant and the Intervenor are dealing at arm\u2019s length during the period in issue.[4]\n[8] If they are at arm\u2019s length, that is the end of the matter and the Intervenor is in insurable employment.\n[9] If they are not dealing at arm\u2019s length, subsection 5(3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act has no application given that the Appellant and the Intervenor are not related persons.\n[10] However, while the perspective is different, considerations contained in subsection 5(3)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act are relevant to the determination of whether the parties are factually at arm\u2019s length.[5]\nThe Facts\n[11] The Appellant was started in 1963 by Mike Kichton. Ownership evolved over time and in the first half of the 1990s Fred Kichton and Mike Kichton Junior took over the company. By 2002 Fred Kichton was the sole owner.[6]\n[12] The Appellant is in the business of providing commercial, industrial and residential earthmoving and related services.\n[13] The Intervenor started working for the appellant in 2002 during the summer months. He began operating equipment; his recollection is that even during his first summer he was an operating foreman. Around 2006 Fred asked the Intervenor to start working full time. He subsequently became a senior project manager, one of the most senior positions in the company.\n[14] In 2007 the Intervenor became a shareholder. At that time he acquired 10% of the shares of the Appellant.\n[15] Fred Kichton was the President of the company.[7]\n[16] The Intervenor never became a director.\n[17] The Intervenor and Fred got along very well. The Intervenor described Fred as being \u201clike a father figure\u201d with a good relationship that continued until late 2019. He was fired on February 20, 2020.[8]\n[18] Although it is not clear when, at some point before April 2013, Fred started planning and executing arrangements for his eventual retirement and for turning over the Appellant company to key individuals in the company including his son, Richard Kichton, and the Intervenor.\n[19] Richard and Fred Kichton were related persons within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.[9]\n[20] Part of Fred\u2019s exiting the company involved a buy back of Fred\u2019s shares by the Appellant. While the evidence does not disclose the details of the transaction, it resulted in $7.4 million becoming payable to his company, Fredco. This loan, the Fredco loan, is referred to in the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement.[10]\n[21] The loan was payable over 7 years resulting in an expected final payment in 2020.\n[22] As previously stated Fred was the President of the Appellant. In addition, until such time as the loan was paid off, the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement provided Fred with very significant powers over the company.\n[23] Under the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement Fredco could \u201c\u2026 veto, repeal, otherwise reverse any resolution or decision of the Directors or any officer or employee of the corporation, previously, or about to be made \u2026\u201d[11]\n[24] Dividends could not be declared without Fred\u2019s consent.[12]\n[25] By the time of the effective date of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, April 2, 2013, Fred no longer had any shares of the company; however, he and his company, Fredco, were signatories of the agreement.\n[26] The shareholders at that date were: 1) the Intervenor who, directly or through a company[13] owned jointly with his spouse, owned 20% of the shares of Appellant, 2) Richard Kichton who directly or through a company owned 25% of the shares of the Appellant, 3) Christopher Dirks who directly or through a company owned 25% of the shares of the appellant and 4) Laurie Conrad who directly or through a company owned 20% of the shares of the Appellant. In addition Matus Toth and Cody Williams each had 5%.[14]\n[27] The owners were also key employees.\n[28] The Notice of Appeal alleges that the Intervenor and the other shareholders had the ability to determine their own salaries and the amount of dividends they would receive. That was admitted by the respondent but not the Intervenor.[15]\n[29] While the respondent admitted those allegations, the corresponding assumptions made by the respondent were phrased somewhat differently. They said the Intervenor and the other shareholders of the appellant collectively determined the terms and conditions of employment the Intervenor.[16]\n[30] With respect to salary, while the evidence is not entirely consistent, I have reached the conclusion that there was some kind of largely collective decision-making involving the owners and Fred with respect to the salaries and dividends of the employee owners including the Intervenor. I have no doubt that given Fred\u2019s rights under the Unanimous shareholders Agreement[17] as well as his role as President, his views would have carried great weight in such discussions.[18]\n[31] The Intervenor was content to go along with whatever decisions were made as to the optimal division at to what he and other owners would receive as salary, bonus or dividends.[19]\n[32] Indeed, the Intervenor agreed in cross-examination that he and the other employees would receive varying salary and\/or dividends with the understanding that lower remuneration in the bad years would be offset by varying salary and\/or dividends in the good years.[20]\n[33] The Intervenor was in a unique position. All the project managers reported to him, including Grant Campbell.[21]\n[34] Under the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement any shareholder who ceases to be a shareholder is deemed to have resigned from their employment without any right of compensation.[22] The Intervenor had been an employee of the company for quite a long time before he signed the USA and thereby agreed to this condition.\n[35] The Unanimous Shareholders Agreement provides that the corporation may require shareholders to loan money to the corporation[23] and may require shareholders to provide guarantees of the corporation to banks and lenders[24]\n[36] Sometime around 2010 the Appellant did earthworks for another company[25] that was developing a subdivision. The Appellant was paid with lots in the subdivision.\n[37] Some of these lots were transferred to the owners and Fred although the transfers were not all done in the same year. Eventually, the owners lived in that subdivision.\n[38] The transfer of the lots to employees was done by declaring bonuses equal to the value of the lot. In the Intervenor\u2019s case this occurred in 2014.[26]\nAnalysis\n[39] It is well accepted in the income tax context the question of whether persons who are not related are dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length should be examined by considering the following questions[27]:\nwas there a common mind which directs the bargaining for both parties to a transaction,\nwere the parties to a transaction acting in concert without separate interests and\nwas there \u201cde facto\u201d control?[28]\n[40] It is recognized by this court that it is difficult to apply this kind of analysis, which was developed in examining transactions for income tax purposes, in the context of examining whether people in employment relationships are at arm\u2019s length from their employer.[29]\n[41] It is also accepted that one may examine all the circumstances of the employment relationship to determine whether the terms and conditions of the employment relationship are substantially similar to those which parties at arm\u2019s length would agree upon.[30]\n[42] If the terms and conditions of employment are far removed from what one can expect between arm\u2019s length parties that is a strong indication of not dealing at arm\u2019s length.[31]\n[43] This exercise can be a difficult one. If a particular individual has a position which is one a number of very similar positons the exercise can be quite straightforward but the more unique the position the more difficult the exercise.\n[44] The parties pointed out particular examples of certain terms and conditions that were, or were not, in their submission, consistent with an arm\u2019s length arrangement.\n[45] In examining whether or not the terms and conditions are substantially similar to those that would exist in an arm\u2019s length relationship it is important to keep in mind two considerations.\n[46] First, one must compare substantially similar positions. One would expect the terms and conditions of an equipment operator to be different from those of a project manager, for example. If some types of skills are in short supply that may result in different levels of remuneration for such positions as compared to otherwise similar positions not requiring those skills and not in short supply.\n[47] Similarly, differences between employees that relate to their role in a company or that do not increase their remuneration, whether in salary or benefits, are not relevant to this exercise.[32]\n[48] Secondly, if a difference with other employees is solely the result of his being a shareholder that is not a term or condition of employment.\n[49] Thus the fact that the Intervenor made shareholder loans to the company and provided bank guarantees, something that the company could require under the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement are not part of the employment relationship.[33]\n[50] With respect to the traditional tests, on the evidence, I do not see how it can be said that there is a common mind directing both the appellant and the Intervenor setting the terms and conditions of the Intervenor\u2019s employment. Similarly I do not see how one could conclude that either the appellant or the Intervenor has de facto control of the other.\n[51] With respect to the remaining test, the owner employees, including the Intervenor, and Fred are acting in concert in setting the remuneration of owner employees and with respect to the split between remuneration of the owners and dividends.\n[52] In so doing they are acting without separate interests because they are taking account of each others interests as employees and as shareholders and acting not only for their own individual benefit but also for the benefit of the others in a context of reciprocity.[34]\n[53] This leads to the conclusion that Appellant and the Intervenor were not at arm\u2019s length.\n[54] Turning to the terms and conditions of employment, there are a number of factors not previously discussed that do not point clearly one way or the other.\n[55] For example, the Intervenor had a salary less than Grant Campbell, a person who reported to the Appellant. However, when one takes account of salary and bonuses the Intervenor he clearly received higher remuneration in the years we can compare. That is not an unusual result.[35]\n[56] In addition it appears that the Intervenor had what he referred as a $25,000 spending account. If I understand correctly the evidence this meant that he could use for personal purposes some of the Appellant\u2019s earthmoving equipment for up to a certain amount of usage equal to that amount. He did make use of equipment. This is an unusual benefit but some benefits relate to the type of business one works in. It has value and increases his remuneration but it does not appear to me clear that the overall remuneration is excessive to the point of demonstrating that the terms and conditions could not be arm\u2019s length terms and conditions.[36]\n[57] There was evidence that there were somewhat more flexible work arrangements with respect to time and place of work of the intervenor. This is not uncommon where an employer is dealing with a trusted senior employee so long as the job is getting done and the individual is physically present when in person interaction is needed. Arm\u2019s length parties could certainly have agreed on such terms. [37]\n[58] There are three factors that are not consistent with a contract substantially similar to the one that persons at arm\u2019s length would agree upon.\nThe Intervenor\u2019s acceptance of very significantly varying remuneration on the basis that lower remuneration in bad years of the business will be offset by higher remuneration and\/or dividends in good years.[38]\nThe fact that the Intervenor as an employee has a say on the employer\u2019s side of the bargain even if that say is limited.\nAgreeing to one\u2019s automatic termination as an employee if one ceases to own shares is not something that an arm\u2019s length employee would agree to.[39]\n[59] These factors lead me to conclude that overall the terms and conditions of this contract are not substantially similar to those one would fin in an arm\u2019s length contract.\nConclusion\n[60] Consequently, the Intervenor and the Appellant are not dealing at arm\u2019s length and the appeal will be allowed and:\nThe decision of the Minister of National Revenue is varied to reflect that Russ Giselbrecht was not in insurable employment for the period January 7, 2019 to February 20, 2020.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 15th day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

M.N.R. 2023 TCC 53 at paragraph 99.\n[2] Like all employment insurance appeals, this appeal is heard under a modified form of the Informal Procedure. See paragraph 18.29 of the Tax Court of Canada Act and the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure respecting the Employment Insurance Act. Among the applicable provisions is subsection 18.15(3) which states: \u2026the Court is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence in conducting a hearing and the appeal shall be dealt with by the Court as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit.\n[3] This paragraph relates to taxpayers and personal trusts and has no relevance to this appeal.\n[4] Relevant facts prior to the period provide context to the relationships and may be consider in making the determination.\n[5] See discussion below.\n[6] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.177.\n[7] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.17.]\n[8] Transcript of the 8 March 2023, p.63.\n[9] No one else relevant to the issues in this appeal was related within the meaning of the ITA.\n[10] See Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.66 and 167 as well as the definition of \u201cFredco Loans\u201d on page 4 of Exhibit R-1, Tab 4.\n[11] See Article 3.02.02 of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, on page 12 of Exhibit R-1, Tab 4 as well as Article 1.01.01(ff) at page 6 of that Agreement. There are other places where that agreement provides Fred with other special powers, notably at articles 6.01.05 and .06 as well as 9.03.02(b) the Agreement.\n[12] See Article 9.02.02 of the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement.\n[13] The appellant owned all of the voting shares of that company.\n[14] Transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, p.208 and 210. It would appear that Cody Williams ceased to be a shareholder in the middle of 2019 and Matus Toth may have ceased to be a shareholder before that.\n[15] See paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Notice of Appeal, paragraph 2 of the Reply to Notice of Appeal and paragraph 20 of the Notice of intervention.\n[16] See subparagraphs 13c, q and s of the Reply to Notice of Appeal.\n[17] The USA is in exhibit R-1, Tab 4.\n[18] While the Intervenor stated that he did not feel that he had much influence, he did agree that the salaries resulted from a discussion among the owners and Fred where they all went along with what was fair. Richard Kichton also testified that salaries and dividends were determined as a group. See transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 17, 18 and 157.\n[19] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing, pages 77, 78 (especially in the middle of the page), and 112, as well as 94, 95 with respect to the transfer of the lots to, among others, the employee owners, a subject I shall discuss later.\n[20] See, inter alia, the transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 164 and 165.\n[21] Testimony of Richard Kichton, transcript of the 8 March 2023, page 118. Although Mr. Campbell became a Senior Project Manager, the same title as the Intervenor, on or about 27 February 2018, it is clear from the offer letter that he reported \u201cdirectly to Russ Giselbrecht, with additional reporting to the ownership group.\u201d It may well be that the management of the project managers was light because everyone knew their role and performed it well but it is quite clear that there was a line of authority when needed. See also exhibit A-4.\n[22] See article 9.16.01 of the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement.\n[23] Article 9.07.03\n[24] Article 9.08.01\n[25] A numbered company of which the Intervenor was a shareholder.\n[26] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing at pages 36, 49 to 51, 94, 95, 161 and 215. While the Intervenor\u2019s recollection was that there were probably dividends equal to the value of the lots, Laurie Conrad\u2019s recollection was that it was by way of bonus equal to the value of the lots. On this point I accept Laurie Conrad\u2019s evidence because she was the Corporate Controller of the Appellant and it is consistent with the T4s and T5s in evidence: see Exhibits A-2 and A-3. Some documents show Laurie Conrad as Laurie Schreiner; both names are the same person.\n[27] Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2008] 2 SCR 79 at paragraph 62.\n[28] i.e. one person directing both sides of the transaction. See Keybrand Foods Inc. v. Canada, 2020 FCA 201 at paragraphs 50 to 53.\n[29] See Martel v. M.N.R., 2017 TCC 238 at paragraphs 63 to 65.\n[30] See Martel v. M.N.R., 2017 TCC 238 at paragraph 66. While at first this may seem surprising as an approach, I would note that this is done in other areas as well for example, see Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at paragraphs 78 to 90.]\n[31] See Canada v. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 FCA 157 at paragraph 84 by analogy.\n[32] Thus, the provision of a credit card to pay for business expenses is not relevant to the examination given that it has not been shown that it was provided to the Intervenor to allow him to incur personal expenses. Similarly, the fact that he had a key that gave him access to more of the office than others had does not confer any benefit forming part of remuneration for him and does not assist the examination. Also, if he received the key qua shareholder it is not relevant. There is no need to determine in which capacity he received the key.\n[33] The shareholder loans were done by journal entries; dividends or bonuses were declared and then loaned back to the company. The Intervenor believes it was done by dividend; see transcript of the 8 March 2023, pages 52 and 53.\n[34] See Gestion Yvan Drouin Inc. v. The Queen, 2000 CanLII 407 (TCC) at paragraph 75.\n[35] In the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 Grant Campbell earned more in two of those years; however, in the remaining year the Intervenor\u2019s total remuneration was such that for the three years as a whole the Intervenor earned roughly $67,000 more than Mr. Campbell. Because the Intervenor was fired early in 2020 one can not make any comparison in that year. There is no data on Mr. Campbell\u2019s earnings prior to 2017.\n[36] See transcript of the 8 March 2023 hearing at pages 125 to 128. It appears that he was not the only owner employee with such a spending account. There was evidence that other employees could also use equipment for personal purposes but not to the same extent and not with respect to very big equipment; their use was subject to more controls. It is not uncommon for more senior employees to be given greater latitude.\nAlso, to the extent that it may have been suggested that there was use in excess of what was permitted that would be outside of the employment contract.\nIt may be that use of the equipment was a shareholder benefit, in which case, the use would not be relevant.\n[37] Another area the evidence does not allow one to draw conclusions is the evidence relating to travel and sports tickets. Unfortunately, while there is evidence of differences between employees, it is not clear to what extent those result from different roles in relation to business promotion and client relations. Nor is it clear which of those expenses are employee benefits and to what extent the Appellant was a beneficiary as opposed to others.\n[38] I note that this is not like a remuneration package where there is a clear profit sharing scheme or bonuses based on individual performance. The Intervenor\u2019s remuneration is conveniently set out in the right hand column for each year on the last line of the table in Schedule A to the Notice of appeal. Those numbers are supported by Exhibit A 2.\n[39] In addition, receiving a large bonus in the form of a subdivision lot in the context of the Appellant having received payments in lots for its services is not what would be an arm\u2019s length contract.\n",

Piccolo\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nBenjamin Chamberland\nKatie Beahen\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nLafleur J.\nI. REASSESSMENTS AND CONCESSIONS\n[1] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) reassessed Mr. Yu Xing He (the \u201cAppellant\u201d or \u201cMr. He\u201d) under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Applying the net worth method, the Minister added additional net business income totalling $6,281,338 in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s income. Furthermore, the Minister assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the Act for all taxation years.\n[2] Following the Appellant\u2019s objection, the Minister varied the reassessments by decreasing the unreported business income by an amount of approximately $3.6M to an aggregate of $2,658,753, namely: $352,662; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $571,474, for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively. In varying the reassessments, the Minister determined that gains on real estate dispositions were to be considered on a capital account rather than on an income account. Some further adjustments were made to take into account additional assets, additional gifts, a change in the value of a shareholder\u2019s\u2019 loan account (reduction), and an additional reduction by taking into account the non-taxable portion of capital gains on the disposition of assets. Penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act were also adjusted accordingly.\n[3] At the hearing, the parties jointly submitted a partial agreed statement of facts (Exhibit RA-1 \u2013 Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, attached to these reasons as Schedule A). These include specific facts regarding the Appellant\u2019s background, reported income, assets and liabilities for the net worth analysis, and the calculation of discrepancy in total income per the net worth analysis. However, the parties did not agree on facts regarding various loans and gifts the Appellant alleged he received during the taxation years under appeal, the amount the Appellant contributed to the shareholders\u2019 loan account of 2225903 Ontario Inc. (\u201cSeasons\u201d), and whether specific withdrawals found in various bank accounts were business expenses incurred for Seasons or personal expenditures of the Appellant.\n[4] Under Exhibit R-6, the Respondent produced amended schedules, consisting of Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets), Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities), Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth), Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and Schedule V (Analysis of Income Tax Discrepancy per Net Worth). These schedules were produced to replace the various schedules attached to the Reply to the Notice of Appeal and took into account various concessions made by the Respondent at the beginning and in the course of the trial, which I will describe below.\n[5] At the beginning of the trial, the Respondent made the following concessions:\ni)An amount of $493,000 representing the cost of a property located at 147 Purcell Square, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cPurcell Property\u201d), shall be added as an asset on Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) for 2008, with a corresponding long term liability of $432,562 as a mortgage to be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2008;\nii)An amount of $17,700 representing two gifts received by Mr. He shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2012 (see Exhibit RA\u20111, paras. 122\u2013123); and\niii)An amount of $110,452 shall reduce the item \u201cother\u201d in the personal expenditures calculation in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) for 2012, which amount was already included in the asset section of the Balance Sheet (Schedule I: Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in respect of a property located at 4903-14th Avenue, in Markham, Ontario.\n[6] Furthermore, during the trial, the Respondent conceded the following:\ni)An amount of $89,120 representing the total deposits made for the purchase of a property located at 3610-25 Telegram Mews, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cTelegram Mews Property\u201d), shall be added as an asset on Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) for 2008;\nii)An amount of $6,615, representing the non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Telegram Mews Property, shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2009; and\niii)An amount of $421, representing the non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of a property located at 1911-33 Singer Court (the \u201cSinger Property\u201d), shall be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2012.\n[7] Given the above concessions, and according to the Respondent, the Appellant\u2019s unreported business income using the net worth assessment method for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years was respectively established at $196,490; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $442,901, for a total of $2,374,008.\n[8] At trial, Mr. He testified, as did Mr. Benjamin Battiste, the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) appeal officer who reviewed Mr. He\u2019s files at the CRA\u2019s appeal level. Furthermore, Mr. He called the following individuals to testify: Mr. Fei Chen (Mr. He\u2019s nephew), Mr. Guo Lin He (Mr. He\u2019s cousin), and Mr. Hui Min Shi (Mr. He\u2019s brother-in-law).\n[9] All statutory references that follow in these reasons are to the Act unless otherwise stated.\nII. BACKGROUND\n[10] Mr. He immigrated to Canada in 2003, after completing his high school education in China. His first job in Canada was in a supermarket, around 2007. In 2009, he planned to open a supermarket with partners. Between 2009 and 2012, Mr. He was married and living with his spouse and two minor children in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario.\n[11] Since 2004, he and his spouse have jointly owned the Purcell Property, part of which has been rented out since its purchase. Mr. He has also been involved in the purchase and sale of multiple pre-construction properties.\n[12] Mr. He and his spouse reported the following net income for income tax purposes (see Exhibit RA-1, Partial Agreed Statements of Facts, paras. 7\u201342):\n2009: $19,458 (including taxable capital gains and net rental income);\n2010: $22,301 (including net rental income and net business income);\n2011: $25,189 (including taxable capital gains and net rental income); and\n2012: $20,570 (for Mr. He only, including net rental income and employment income; no evidence was adduced at trial on the net income reported by his spouse, but she reported net rental income of $6,857).\n[13] As mentioned above, the reassessments at issue were determined by a net worth analysis. This method is \u201cbased on an assumption that if one subtracts a taxpayer\u2019s net worth at the beginning of a year from that at the end, adds the taxpayers expenditures in the year, deletes non-taxable receipts and accretions to value of existing assets, the net result, less any amount declared by the taxpayer, must be attributable to unreported income earned in the year, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate otherwise\u201d (see Bigayan v. R (1999), [2000] 1 CTC 2229, 2000 DTC 1619 [Bigayan], at para. 2).\n[14] The personal expenditures of Mr. He were determined by the CRA by adding all withdrawals, cheques, drafts and debit memos found in various bank accounts statements and credit cards statements, and deducting all transfers made between bank accounts and all business expenses paid through these bank accounts.\n[15] Mr. He attributes the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth to various loans he had received from friends and family over the years, as well as large gifts mostly from his father-in-law, who lives in China.\nIII. ISSUES\n[16] The issues arising from this appeal are as follows:\ni)Given the concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing, has unreported income been properly determined for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years as being respectively $196,490; $1,096,986; $637,631; and $442,901, for a total of $2,374,008?\nii)Were the 2009 to 2012 taxation years properly reassessed beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i)?\niii)Were penalties under subsection 163(2) properly assessed for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years?\nIV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\nA. The Respondent\u2019s position\n[17] The examination of the various bank accounts shows that the Mr. He did not report all of his income, the source of which is unknown to the Minister. As the Appellant is unable to offer a credible explanation for the source of these funds, the Minister has met his burden to reassess the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) as well as to assess penalties under subsection 163(2). The evidence also showed that Mr. He was given opportunities to make representations in that respect.\n[18] The amount of unreported income, as calculated and detailed in the various schedules found under Exhibit R-6, should be included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s income.\n[19] Mr. Battiste\u2019s testimony was clear that a thorough analysis of the Appellant\u2019s records was made, with no need for estimates.\n[20] Mr. He lacks credibility when he claims that he had received various loans and gifts over the years, as the issue of these loans and gifts was not raised at audit or on appeal, but only during discovery.\n[21] Further, no credible evidence was adduced at trial to allow the Court to conclude that Mr. He did receive these loans and gifts.\n[22] Apart from concessions already made by the Respondent at trial, no other adjustments should be made to the net worth calculations.\nB. The Appellant\u2019s position\n[23] The requirements for reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period were not met by the Minister as the evidence showed that Mr. He carefully reviewed his tax returns before filing them, and that he knew gifts and loans were not taxable. The Court has to take into account the fact that Mr. He was a recent immigrant, having arrived in Canada in 2004. Mr. He did not show any carelessness or neglect in filing his tax returns, and it cannot be concluded that he willfully underreported his income. The evidence showed that Mr. He actively sought his accountant\u2019s advice. Furthermore, for the same reasons, the Minister did not meet his burden in respect of penalties assessed under subsection 163(2).\n[24] However, if the Court is satisfied that the Minister met the requirements for reassessing Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), 38 adjustments (including adjustments referred to in the concessions made by the Respondent as described above) to the schedules attached to the Reply to the Notice of Appeal should be made to arrive at unreported income totalling $998,916, specifically: (-$752); $315,405; $460,406; and $223,857 for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively. These adjustments to the net worth calculations include the various loans and gifts Mr. He allegedly received from friends and family members, including his father-in-law.\nV. CONCLUSION\n[25] In accordance with these reasons, I find that the Minister has met his burden to reassess Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years, and to assess penalties under subsection 163(2).\n[26] Further, in accordance with these reasons, the appeal from the reassessments made under the Act for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years is allowed, with costs to the Respondent, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the unreported income of Mr. He is to be reduced by taking into account the following adjustments to be made to the net worth calculations (which amounts include concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing and additional adjustments described below):\nFor 2009\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): add the deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275 (as it was included in 2008);\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Chen for $80,000 (as it was included in 2008);\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add deductions for $4,269.95 (cheque from the Government of Canada) and for $6,615 (non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Telegram Mews Property); and\nAdditional adjustments to the 2008 taxation year (as described below).\nFor 2010\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): add the deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275 (as it was included in 2008) and the deposit on Fulham Property for $20,000;\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Chen for $60,000 (as the original loan was partially reimbursed) and a loan from Mr. Guo Lin He for $12,000; and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $43,033, consisting of $20,000 (deposit on the Fulham Property), $20,000 (partial reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Chen) and $3,033 (Budget Rent-A-Car payments).\nFor 2011\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Yang for $5,300;\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add a deduction for $46,275 (refund of deposit on the Splendid China Square Property); and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $146,524, consisting of $60,000 (reimbursement of the balance of a loan from Mr. Chen), $12,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Guo Lin He), $10,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Yang), $35,000 (amount paid to Mr. Chen) and $29,524 (Costco payments).\nFor 2012\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): add a loan from Mr. Yang for $5,300 (as it was included in 2011);\nSchedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth): add a deduction for $421 (non-taxable portion of Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s capital gain on the sale of the Singer Property) and for $17,700 (gifts received by Mr. He); and\nSchedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) (with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)): reduce by an aggregate amount of $153,766, consisting of $20,000 (reimbursement of a loan from Mr. Yang), $23,314 (Costco payments) and $110,452 (representing a deposit for a property located at 4903-14th Avenue, in Markham, Ontario).\n[27] Penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) shall be adjusted accordingly.\n[28] In accordance with these reasons, I also find that additional assets and liabilities shall be added to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) and to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for the 2008 taxation year (which year is not under appeal) to take into account concessions made by the Respondent at the hearing and additional adjustments described below:\nSchedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets): Purcell Property for $493,000, deposit on the Telegram Mews Property for $89,120 and deposit on the Splendid China Square Property for $46,275; and\nSchedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities): loan from Mr. Chen for $80,000 and liability (mortgage) in respect of the Purcell Property for $432,562.\nVI. ANALYSIS\nA. The net worth method\n[29] The Minister is not bound by a return or information supplied by a taxpayer, or on his or her behalf, and may use an alternative audit method to assess the tax payable (subsection 152(7)).\n[30] As indicated above, the Minister used a net worth method to reassess Mr. He for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Mr. Battiste, the CRA appeal officer, testified that the audit conducted by the CRA was a thorough review of financial records, as no estimates or statistics were used to determine the unreported income. The bank withdrawal method was used under the net worth analysis. The auditor obtained various bank accounts statements (including line of credit statements) and credit card statements through the CRA\u2019s power to obtain information and did a withdrawal analysis. The CRA was able to identify 10 bank accounts and lines of credits held by Mr. He and his spouse. Mr. He did not provide any bank statements or credit cards statements to the CRA. Under the withdrawal analysis, specific amounts were recognized as business expenses, and inter-account transfers and mortgage payments were identified, and these amounts were removed from the calculation of personal expenditures found in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) to avoid any double counting of amounts.\n[31] I found that the testimony of Mr. Battiste was clear and credible.\n[32] As a general rule, in an appeal to this Court, the burden of proof rests on the taxpayer. A taxpayer thus bears the burden of demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact and proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his or her position. On the other hand, the Minister has the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying the assessment of penalties under subsection 163(2) (subsection 163(3)) and the facts justifying reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period (subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i)).\n[33] In the case at bar, reassessments were made beyond the normal reassessment period. The Minister will discharge his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) if he establishes that \u201cthere is a discrepancy . . . between a taxpayer\u2019s assets and his expenses, and that discrepancy continues to be unexplained and inexplicable\u201d (see Molenaar v. Canada, 2004 FCA 349 at para. 4, cited with approval in Lacroix v. The Queen, 2008 FCA 241 [Lacroix], at para. 33).\n[34] Further, as stated in Lacroix (at para. 32):\n[i]nsofar as the Tax Court of Canada is satisfied that the taxpayer earned unreported income and did not provide a credible explanation for the discrepancy between his or her reported income and his or her net worth, the Minister has discharged the burden of proof on him within the meaning of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) and subsection 162(3) [sic].\n[35] If the Minister discharges his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), it will then be on Mr. He to identify the source of the income and to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the income is not taxable. Mr. He will have to prove, on a balance of probabilities, the facts justifying his position. Mr. He can also challenge the net worth reassessment by establishing that the net worth method was inherently flawed (see Bigayan, supra, at paras. 3\u20134).\n[36] In order to successfully challenge the reassessments at issue, Mr. He must present detailed and cogent testimony, and supporting evidence where possible, to explain the various withdrawals found in his bank accounts and why they should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures. Mr. He can also succeed either by establishing, on a balance of probabilities, new facts, not considered by the Minister, showing that the unreported income was not taxable (for example, by proving he had received various gifts and loans), or by demonstrating that the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact are wrong. For example, Mr. He can present evidence supporting he owned additional assets and incurred more liabilities.\n[37] It is possible that Mr. He\u2019s burden will not be met if the Respondent successfully challenges the evidence adduced at the hearing, if the evidence is contradictory or if the Court draws a negative inference from Mr. He\u2019s failure to produce evidence or to call witnesses to establish a central facts relied upon by him.\n[38] Thus, Mr. He\u2019s credibility and the sufficiency of his evidence will be determinative (Landry v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 399, at paragraph 47; Roy v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 226). This Court, however, may also consider the overall reasonableness of the reassessments in its determination of whether to allow the appeal.\n[39] Courts have recognized that a net worth assessment is an arbitrary and imprecise approximation of a taxpayer\u2019s income. However, the Federal Court of Appeal noted the following in Hsu v. The Queen, 2001 FCA 240, at para. 30:\nAny perceived unfairness relating to this type of assessment is resolved by recognizing that the taxpayer is in the best position to know his or her own taxable income. Where the factual basis of the Minister\u2019s estimation is inaccurate, it should be a simple matter for the taxpayer to correct the Minister\u2019s error to the satisfaction of the Court.\n[40] For the following reasons, which I will elaborate upon later herein, I find that the Minister has established, on a balance of probabilities, facts justifying the reassessments made beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years and facts justifying the assessment of penalties under subsection 163(2). I find that Mr. He had earned unreported income that he failed to report. Further, I also find that Mr. He did not provide credible explanations for the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth. Some parts of Mr. He\u2019s testimony were credible, and, as such, I find that some adjustments must be made to the Minister\u2019s calculations under the net worth assessment. However, I also find that other parts of Mr. He\u2019s testimony were not credible and, as such, I did not accept all the adjustments raised by the Appellant.\nB. Credibility of Mr. He, reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period and penalties\n(1) Credibility of Mr. He\n[41] When assessing the credibility of a witness, I can consider inconsistencies, the attitude and demeanour of the witness, motives the witness may have to fabricate evidence, and the \u201coverall sense of the evidence\u201d. As stated by Justice Valerie Miller in Nichols v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 334:\n[23] In assessing credibility I can consider inconsistencies or weaknesses in the evidence of witnesses, including internal inconsistencies (that is, whether the testimony changed while on the stand or from that given at discovery), prior inconsistent statements, and external inconsistencies (that is, whether the evidence of the witness is inconsistent with independent evidence which has been accepted by me). Second, I can assess the attitude and demeanour of the witness. Third, I can assess whether the witness has a motive to fabricate evidence or to mislead the court. Finally, I can consider the overall sense of the evidence. That is, when common sense is applied to the testimony, does it suggest that the evidence is impossible or highly improbable.\n[42] In assessing the evidence adduced at trial, I can accept all, some or reject all of a witness testimony and I can also accept part of a witness evidence and reject other parts (see Ha v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 271, at para. 21).\n[43] According to the Respondent, Mr. He lacks credibility. Mr. He had motive to mislead the Court, as he does not want to pay the taxes at issue. Mr. He alleges that the income as reported was correct, but his explanations as to how he sustains his family of four in Toronto is based on large gifts received from his father-in-law, and loans received from friends and family members, but no documentary evidence was adduced in that respect. Further, there were inconsistencies and weaknesses in his testimony.\n[44] I agree with the Respondent. For the following reasons, I find that Mr. He\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged large gifts received from his father-in-law was not credible, and I totally reject that part of Mr. He\u2019s testimony. Among other things, there was no corroboration and no supporting documentation produced at trial; further, there were inconsistencies between his testimony at trial and his answers on discovery; and finally, the issues of the gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law were not raised at audit, or at the objection level, but only at trial.\n[45] According to Mr. He, he received approximately $30,000 as a gift from his father-in-law every year, and his spouse also received gifts from her father every year.\n[46] More particularly, Mr. He testified that he had received the following gifts from his father-in-law:\n-in 2009: $30,000, but according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings, he received $22,280 (see Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 13);\n-in 2010: $100,000 (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings \u2013 Exhibit R\u20114, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 15);\n-in 2011: Mr. He did not remember the exact amount received (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings, he would have received $47,536 \u2013 Exhibit R\u20114, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 15); and\n-in 2012: $68,000 (according to Mr. He\u2019s undertakings \u2013 Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read-Ins, p. 17).\n[47] Mr. He testified that it was his spouse who received the funds purported to be gifts from his father-in-law and deposited these amounts in one of their bank accounts. However, at the hearing, Mr. He was not able to show in which bank accounts these funds were deposited. Furthermore, Mr. He testified that the funds were not sent directly to his spouse by his father-in-law, who lives in China, because of transfer difficulties between China and Canada. He testified that some friends of his spouse\u2019s sister who live in Canada transferred the funds to his spouse. Then, his father-in-law reimbursed the families of these friends in China. Mr. He did not remember the names of any of these friends. Mr. He testified that gifts from his father-in-law were always delivered to him and his spouse in the same manner.\n[48] Mr. He testified that no formal documentation was prepared as these were transfers between family members.\n[49] At the hearing, the Respondent asked the Court to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call Mr. He\u2019s spouse to testify, because her testimony would have been central to establishing that gifts were received from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law over the years.\n[50] As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. v. The Queen, 2011 FCA 79 [Imperial Pacific] (at para. 14), a Tax Court judge can draw an adverse inference from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness, especially if the witness\u2019s evidence would have been central to establishing an important fact.\n[51] In the case at bar, the testimony of Mr. He\u2019s spouse was central to establishing the existence of these large gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law, and particularly, in showing how funds were transferred from her father (indirectly through her sister\u2019s friends) to their bank accounts. I did not receive any explanation justifying Mr. He\u2019s spouse\u2019s absence at trial. I find that I should draw an adverse inference from Mr. He\u2019s failure to call his spouse at the hearing, and I find that her testimony would have been unfavourable to Mr. He.\n[52] For all these reasons, no adjustments shall be made to the net worth calculations in respect of those alleged gifts from Mr. He\u2019s father-in-law.\n[53] Furthermore, I have significant concerns about Mr. He\u2019s testimony regarding various funds allegedly received as loans from friends and family. As indicated below, I accept that he had received some funds during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years as loans, but not to the extent that would justify the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[54] At audit and the CRA\u2019s appeal, Mr. He did not raise the fact that he had received specific funds as loans from friends and family. It was only on discovery and at trial that Mr. He raised these alleged specific loans from friends and family.\n[55] At audit and the CRA\u2019s appeal, Mr. He maintained that he participated in a traditional Chinese loan arrangement called \u201cFujian Arrangement\u201d (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20 - Letter from Mr. He\u2019s agent dated May 15, 2015, and addressed to the CRA auditor) and that would justify in part the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[56] However, Mr. He did not participate in a traditional Chinese lending program during the 2009 to 2012 period (Exhibit RA-1, Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, para. 127).\n[57] At trial, Mr. He testified that the reference to the Fujian Arrangement by his representative at the time of audit was just given as an example. Mr. He testified that he was not participating in such an arrangement during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. However, the letter from Mr. He\u2019s representative clearly states that \u201cMr. He participated in a number of these mutual lending groups\u201d, referring to the Fujian Arrangement (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20, p. 180) to justify the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[58] Again, I have significant concerns about Mr. He\u2019s evidence regarding the various funds he had received as loans, given the above-described inconsistencies and the justification changing at trial from what was advanced at audit and at CRA appeal.\n[59] For these reasons, only particular loans, as alleged by Mr. He, that were sufficiently supported through corroborating testimony at trial will be accepted to reduce Mr. He\u2019s unreported income as determined by the net worth assessment. These acceptable loans will be enumerated below. However, the acceptance of these particular loans do not justify the discrepancy between Mr. He\u2019s reported income and his net worth.\n(2) Reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period\n[60] The relevant portion of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) reads as follows:\n152(4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer . . . , except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return . . . .\n[61] As indicated above, the Minister has the onus to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the facts required to justify reassessing after the expiration of the normal reassessment period. The Minister must show to the Court, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He made a misrepresentation in filing his returns and that this misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Respondent did not raise fraud in this appeal.\n[62] In order to make a determination under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i), the Court must assess all of the evidence admitted during the hearing (see Vine Estate v. Canada, 2015 FCA 125, at paras. 24\u201325).\n[63] The Appellant argues that if the Court is satisfied that Mr. He earned unreported income and did not give a credible explanation for the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth, then the Minister has met his burden under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) (see Lacroix, at para. 32).\n[64] For the following reasons, I find that the Minister has discharged his burden to reassess Mr. He beyond the normal reassessment period for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years (see Lacroix, at para. 32). I find that all requirements in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) are met in the case at bar.\n[65] Firstly, Mr. He made a misrepresentation in filing his returns for 2009 to 2012. The case law holds that an incorrect statement in an income tax return amounts to a misrepresentation (Nesbitt v. The Queen, 96 D.T.C. 6045, [1996] F.C.J. No. 19 (F.C.T.D.) (QL); D\u2019Andrea v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 298, at para. 35).\n[66] Because I do not accept Mr. He\u2019s testimony on the alleged large gifts received from his father-in-law and on various alleged funds received as loans from friends and family (other than some loans as will be discussed below), and as I am drawing an adverse inference from the failure to call Mr. He\u2019s spouse to testify, I conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. He must have earned income he had not reported in filing his returns and hence made a misrepresentation in filing his returns.\n[67] I also conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He would not have had sufficient revenue to support a family of four living in Toronto during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. This conclusion reinforces my finding that Mr. He must have earned income he had not reported, which would explain the discrepancy between his reported income and his net worth.\n[68] At first, in making his arguments, the Respondent referred only to Mr. He\u2019s reported net income for income tax purposes. However, at trial, I asked the Respondent to redo his calculations, as Mr. He would have had funds available to him from the sale of properties and from the renting of properties. Furthermore, I asked the Respondent to consider in his calculations other amounts received by Mr. He and his spouse during that time (for example, the amount received under the Canada Child Benefit). On that revised basis, considering capital contributions made to Seasons during those years, as well as expenses incurred on mortgages (capital and interests), tuition fees and rental expenses, Mr. He would have had very little to nominal revenue to sustain his family needs during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years.\n[69] Secondly, I have to determine whether that misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. For the following reasons, I find that the misrepresentation was attributable to wilful default.\n[70] According to the Appellant, when Mr. He reviewed his tax returns, he made sure to report all taxable income earned. Discrepancies in his net worth came from the borrowing of funds, gifts he received and proceeds from the sale of properties. The Appellant also took the position that Mr. He could not have wilfully made a misrepresentation when filing his returns, as he was a new immigrant to Canada at the time, having been in Canada for only five years in 2009. Furthermore, Mr. He did not speak the language and still needed interpretation at the hearing of this appeal. In addition, as Mr. He had carefully reviewed his tax returns, he could not be found to have been careless or neglectful.\n[71] According to the Respondent, the evidence showed that Mr. He had made a misrepresentation attributable to wilful default, or at the very least, he had made misrepresentation attributable to neglect or carelessness. Mr. He testified that he was aware of his obligations to accurately report his income under the Act. When asked the question, he testified that because of the language barrier, he simply signed his tax returns without reviewing them. However, when pressed, he testified that he had his accountant review the content of his tax returns and explain the numbers. According to the Respondent, these two answers cannot co-exist. Hence, that showed Mr. He was aware of the importance of accurately reporting income under the Act. Further, that conflicting testimony also undermines Mr. He\u2019s credibility.\n[72] I agree with the Respondent that the evidence showed that Mr. He had made a misrepresentation attributable to wilful default. Because Mr. He must have known he had unreported income and chose not to report it, he knew he was making a false statement in filing his income tax returns, and that was intentional.\n[73] Further, even if I were to accept all the Appellant\u2019s requested adjustments to the net worth calculations (which for the reasons below I do not), Mr. He would still have earned substantial unreported income totalling approximately $999,000 in the 2009 to 2012 taxation years.\n(3) Penalties\n[74] Subsection 163(2) provides that \u201c[e]very person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made . . . a false statement or omission in a return\u201d is liable to a penalty.\n[75] The burden of establishing the facts justifying the assessment of the penalty is on the Minister, under subsection 163(3).\n[76] The penalties assessed under subsection 163(2) of the Act must be imposed only where the evidence clearly justifies it. If the evidence leaves any doubt that the penalties should be applied in the circumstances of the appeal, then the only fair conclusion is that the taxpayer must receive the benefit of the doubt in those circumstances (see Farm Business Consultants Inc. v. The Queen, [1994] 2 C.T.C. 2450, 95 D.T.C. 200, at para. 27).\n[77] According to the very wording of subsection 163(2) of the Act, two elements are required for a penalty to apply: (1) a mental element (\u201cknowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d) and (2) a material element (\u201chas made . . . a false statement or omission in a return\u201d).\n[78] Regarding the material element, as indicated above, the case law holds that an incorrect statement in an income tax return amounts to a misrepresentation. Here, it was established that Mr. He filed his income tax returns for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years. Furthermore, it was established, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. He did not report all of his income for all taxation years. Thus, the material element exists in the case at bar.\n[79] Regarding the mental element, two possible scenarios have to be examined for penalties to apply: did Mr. He knowingly make a false statement or omission, or did he make a false statement under circumstances amounting to gross negligence?\n[80] Here, as indicated above, I found that Mr. He had made a false statement in his returns by not reporting all of his income. Furthermore, I was not satisfied with his explanations justifying the discrepancy in his reported income and his net worth, as I found that some parts of his testimony were not credible.\n[81] Hence, Mr. He must have known he had a source of income he did not report and therefore knowingly filed incorrect returns.\n[82] As indicated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Deyab v. The Queen, 2020 FCA 222 (at para. 69, referring to Lacroix), the failure to provide a credible explanation is sufficient to justify the assessment of the penalty under subsection 163(2) of the Act.\n[83] Here, it is not appropriate to give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. He, as I did find that his explanations on the various gifts and loans, which would allegedly justify the discrepancy in his income and his net worth, were not credible. Having assessed all the evidence submitted at trial, I find that large amounts of income remain unexplained.\n[84] For the foregoing reasons, the penalties, as adjusted to take into account adjustments to the net worth calculations and the Respondent\u2019s concessions, shall be upheld.\nC. Adjustments to the net worth calculations\n[85] I will now turn to the adjustments the Appellant argued should be made to the net worth calculations.\n(1) Additional Assets (Schedule I \u2013 Balance Sheet \u2013 Asset) and corresponding adjustments\n[86] Mr. He testified that two properties were missing from the list established by the CRA during audit, namely, a small store located in Chinatown he was planning to open in 2005, called the \u201cSplendid China Square Property\u201d and a warehouse located at 20 Rolark Drive, in Toronto, Ontario (the \u201cWarehouse\u201d), purchased in 2012.\n[87] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, a deposit made by Mr. He for the purchase of a property located at 9 Fulham Street (the \u201cFulham Property\u201d) should be taken into account, and various adjustments should be made to the value of the shareholders\u2019 loan account of Seasons.\n\u00b7 Investment of $46,275 in the Splendid China Square Property\n[88] In 2005, Mr. He made a deposit totalling $46,275 to buy a commercial condominium in a development called Splendid China Square (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 262). Because the building was never built, the builder refunded the amount of the deposit to Mr. He and paid interest on deposit totalling $3,123.31 (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, pp. 260 and 261 for a copy of two cheques dated August 22, 2011: one for $46,275 and one for $3,123.31, totalling $49,398.31). These amounts were deposited in Mr. He\u2019s RBC bank account (#5699) in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 615). In August 2011, Mr. He and the builder entered into an agreement entitled \u201cMutual Release and Termination Agreement\u201d (see Exhibit A\u20111, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 258).\n[89] According to the Appellant, the deposit on Splendid China Square Property should be added, as an asset of $46,275, to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, an amount of $46,275 should be added to the deductions listed on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2011.\n[90] I agree with the Appellant that the above adjustments to the net worth calculations in respect of the Splendid China Square Property shall be made.\n\u00b7 The Warehouse\n[91] Mr. He testified that the Warehouse was bought in 2012, with two partners (Mr. Guo Lin He and Mr. Kai Chen), each contributing 33% of the purchase price. Mr. He testified that the purchase was made through a corporation.\n[92] Mr. He further testified that he financed his contribution by borrowing money from Mr. Guo Lin He, roughly $100,000, but he did not remember specifics of the loan, such as how the funds were transferred, and there was no documentation associated with this loan. The Appellant produced Exhibit A-2, a money order of $101,919 from Mr. He to Kai Wing Tsang in trust, who was the lawyer who handle the purchase of the Warehouse.\n[93] According to the Appellant, as the loan from Mr. Guo Lin He to Mr. He for the purchase of the Warehouse was made in 2012, and the purchase of the Warehouse was also concluded in 2012, these transactions would have a neutral effect on the net worth calculations, and no adjustments will have to be made to the net worth calculations.\n[94] Accordingly, there will be no adjustments to the net worth calculations in respect of the Warehouse and the loan from Mr. Guo Lin He.\n\u00b7 Deposit of $20,000 for the purchase of the \u201cFulham Property\u201d\n[95] The Appellant produced a Purchase & Sale Agreement dated November 28, 2010, between Mr. He as purchaser and Adam Bholat as vendor in respect of the purchase of the Fulham Property (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 24, p. 279). By virtue of this agreement, Mr. He agreed to make a deposit totalling $20,000 by cheque made to \u201cMichal Hasek Real Estate Ltd. Brokerage\u201d in anticipation of the purchase of the Fulham Property. The statement of adjustments also refers to a deposit of $20,000 (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 24, p. 280).\n[96] The withdrawal analysis of the Royal Bank of Canada account (#5699) shows that two cheques went through the account on December 1, 2010 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, p. 108). Mr. Battiste testified that this amount was included in the personal expenditures calculations.\n[97] According to the Appellant, the deposit on the Fulham Property should be added as an asset of $20,000 to Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) in 2010. Furthermore, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same year.\n[98] I agree with the Appellant that the above adjustments to the net worth calculations shall be made.\n\u00b7 Shareholders\u2019 Loan Account in Seasons\n[99] Schedule I (Balance Sheet \u2013 Assets) includes an asset consisting of the balance of the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons at the end of a given year, in the following amounts for the years 2009 to 2012 respectively: $74,975; $958,573; $943,426 and $1,096,456.\n[100] The evidence showed that the shareholders\u2019 loan account balance in Seasons was in the following amounts for the 2009 to 2012 taxation years respectively: $299,900; $3,834,290; $3,813,705 and $4,385,822 (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tabs 26, 27, 30, 31, and 32).\n[101] Mr. He testified that around 2009, Mr. Shang Hui Zeng, Mr. Guo Lin He, Mr. Xun Gen Zheng and himself constituted Seasons in order to complete the purchase of an old market in Brampton and carry on the business of a new supermarket. Mr. He testified that he got involved in Seasons after his cousin, Mr. Guo Lin He, asked him to join in the venture. Mr. Guo Lin He had experience in that field and had immigrated to Canada before Mr. He. The supermarket opened on June 18, 2010.\n[102] According to Mr. He, the partners had estimated that they needed $4M to buy the former market, to renovate the building where the new supermarket would be located and to start operating the business, each partner being responsible for investing $1M in the capital of Seasons. The evidence is silent as to when the investment had to be made.\n[103] The evidence showed that Mr. He owns shares in Seasons, in the following proportion: 25% in 2009, 20% in 2010 and 2011 and 32% in 2012 (Exhibit RA\u20111, Partial Agreed Statement of Facts, Paras. 81 to 84).\n[104] Mr. He testified that although he had legal title to 25% of the shares, he owned a beneficial interest of only 8% and had invested approximately $320,000 in the capital of Seasons over the years. According to Mr. He, the balance of capital needed in Seasons was provided by his family (12% together by his spouse\u2019s sister and his brother and sister) as well as by an investor (5% by Mr. Zeng Min Fei).\n[105] As indicated by Mr. He, Mr. Guo Lin He also testified that each shareholder was responsible for contributing $1M to the capital of Seasons. According to Mr. Guo Lin He, the partners had to borrow from relatives and friends to assist with the financing. Mr. Xun Gen Zheng, one of Seasons\u2019 shareholders, was the person responsible for tracking the amounts contributed by each shareholder. In 2011, another person became a shareholder of Seasons, namely, Mr. Minfei Zheng.\n[106] As mentioned above, on appeal, Mr. Battiste concluded that it was reasonable to attribute only 25% of the balance of the shareholders\u2019 loan account to Mr. He and not the totality of it, as Mr. He owned 25% of the shares of Seasons. Consequently, Mr. Battiste reduced the value of that asset accordingly in the net worth calculations.\n[107] However, according to the Appellant, the shareholders\u2019 loan account balance attributable to Mr. He should be the aggregate of the funds actually transferred by Mr. He over the years to Seasons\u2019 bank account, and no more, as the net worth is a calculation of Mr. He\u2019s net worth. The ownership of shares in Seasons is not relevant, and only contributions of capital made by Mr. He over the years are relevant.\n[108] As argued by the Appellant, and conceded by the Respondent, I find that for the purposes of the net worth calculations, the percentage of shares owned by Mr. He is not a relevant factor, as the relevant amount to be included as an asset under the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons is the aggregate contributions of capital made by Mr. He to the capital of Seasons.\n[109] For that purpose, the Appellant asks the Court to count only the following transfers from Mr. He\u2019s accounts to Seasons\u2019 bank accounts as found by the CRA during audit. At audit, the CRA found that Mr. He had transferred funds totalling $360,050 from his bank accounts to Seasons\u2019 bank account during the 2009 to 2012 taxation years (see Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 26), as follows:\n-in 2009: two transfers totalling $65,000 from his TD bank account (#0532);\n-in 2010: various transfers totalling $255,050 from his TD bank account (#0677), RBC bank account (#5699) and CIBC bank account (#6531);\n-in 2012: one transfer for $40,000 from his RBC bank account (#5699).\n[110] The CRA could not trace any transfers made by Mr. He to Seasons\u2019 bank account in 2011.\n[111] However, Mr. He never provided copies of any records or ledgers detailing the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons, although requested by the CRA, including Mr. Battiste.\n[112] Then, at trial, Mr. He did not provide any documentary evidence for the calculation of the shareholders\u2019 loan account. Furthermore, according to Mr. Guo Lin He\u2019s testimony, Mr. He never requested a copy of the shareholders\u2019 loan account ledger. In addition, Mr. Xun Gen Zheng, the shareholder responsible for keeping track of funds invested by Seasons\u2019 shareholders, did not testify at the hearing.\n[113] I find that Mr. He should have been able to provide the Court with documentary evidence to support his position. I find that Mr. He should have produced documentary evidence showing the capital contributions he had made over the years to the capital of Seasons. I cannot conclude that the CRA, in the course of the audit, was able to determine all capital contributions made by Mr. He to the capital of Seasons, given that Mr. He never provided any documents to the CRA in the course of the audit in respect of his capital contributions.\n[114] Also, Mr. He should have called Mr. Xun Gen Zheng to testify. I agree with the Respondent that I should draw a negative inference from the failure by Mr. He to call Mr. Zheng to testify at the hearing (see Imperial Pacific, supra, at para. 14). I find that Mr. Zheng\u2019s testimony would not have been favourable to Mr. He\u2019s position.\n[115] Given the lack of credible and reliable evidence adduced at the hearing and the negative inference drawn from the failure to call Mr. Zheng to testify, I find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in respect of the shareholders\u2019 loan account in Seasons.\n(2) Additional liabilities (Schedule II \u2013 Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) and corresponding adjustments\n[116] Mr. He claimed that he had received funds as loans from various persons. At trial, Mr. He was unable to provide any loan documentation, as he testified personal loans were never documented because they were transactions with friends and family. However, for some of the alleged loans, Mr. He was able to produce evidence in the form of cheques or other documents. Furthermore, witnesses testified in respect of some of the loans. In those circumstances, where the provided evidence was credible and reliable, I did find that adjustments had to be made to the net worth calculations to take into account these operations.\n\u00b7 Loan from Banxin Chen\n[117] Mr. He testified that in 2009, he received an amount of $28,000 from a friend, Mr. Banxin Chen, in order to help him make capital contributions to Seasons.\n[118] Mr. He produced in evidence a cheque made out to him by Ocean Linksys Inc., a corporation owned by Mr. Chen, for $28,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 11). Mr. He testified that his father-in-law reimbursed Mr. Chen\u2019s father in China.\n[119] Mr. He was unable to provide any loan documentation. Further, Mr. He was not able to say in which bank account those funds were deposited, but the evidence showed that these funds were deposited in Mr. He\u2019s bank account at RBC (#5699) (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 610).\n[120] According to the Appellant, Ocean Linksys Inc. had no reason to write Mr. He a cheque, other than to make a loan to him. Further, according to the Appellant, in 2009, it would have been reasonable for Mr. He to reach out to friends and family in order to capitalize Seasons. For these reasons, according to the Appellant, an amount of $28,000 should be added as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2009 to 2012.\n[121] The Appellant did not satisfy me, on a balance of probabilities, that the amount of $28,000 should be added as a liability for 2009 to 2012. The evidence is not clear as to when or if the amount of $28,000 was ever repaid. Mr. He testified that his father-in-law reimbursed Mr. Chen\u2019s father in China, without providing any details in that respect. Further, Mr. He did not refer to that loan in his answers to undertakings (Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Read Ins, page 13). Given the lack of evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that Mr. He did not meet his burden to show that his position should prevail. I therefore find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in that respect.\n\u00b7 Loan from Xue Yu Chen\n[122] Mr. He testified that he had borrowed $80,000 from Mr. Chen in 2008 or before. According to Mr. He, these funds were deposited in one of his bank accounts, but he could not say in which account.\n[123] Mr. He adduced into evidence two cheques he wrote to Mr. Chen: one cheque dated August 5, 2010, for $20,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 12, p. 265) and one cheque dated May 2, 2011, for $60,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 13, p. 266). Mr. He testified that these cheques were issued in repayment of the loan.\n[124] Mr. Battiste testified that the amounts of $60,000 and $20,000 were added to the personal expenditures calculation on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in 2011 and 2010, respectively (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 133 and Tab 15, p. 108).\n[125] According to the Appellant, a liability of $80,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2008 and 2009. As partial repayment was made in 2010, the liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) should be in the amount of $60,000 instead of $80,000 in 2010. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000 in 2010.\n[126] Furthermore, according to the Appellant, as the final repayment of the loan was made in 2011, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan in 2011. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $60,000 in 2011.\n[127] Since credible documentary evidence was adduced at trial to establish the existence of a loan and the repayment of it, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Loan from Lan Lin\n[128] Mr. He testified that he had received a loan for $10,000 from Mr. Lan Lin, a friend of his spouse, in 2010. However, at trial, Mr. He was unable to provide any particulars in respect of that loan. No loan documentation was produced at the hearing. According to Mr. He, that amount was deposited in a bank account, but Mr. He was not able to indicate in which bank account the sum was deposited.\n[129] Mr. He testified that on May 5, 2011, he issued a cheque to Mr. Lin in the amount of $10,000 (see a copy of the cheque in Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 14, p. 267) in repayment of the loan.\n[130] Mr. Battiste testified that this amount was added to the calculation of personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 133).\n[131] According to the Appellant, a liability of $10,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2010. In 2011, as the final repayment of the loan was made, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan. In addition, the personal expenditures on Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) and the corresponding additions to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) should be reduced by an amount of $10,000 in 2011.\n[132] I find that as that alleged loan was linked to Mr. He\u2019s spouse, Mr. He should have called his spouse to testify. Because of Mr. He\u2019s failure to call his spouse to testify, I find that her testimony would have been unfavourable to Mr. He\u2019s position (see Imperial Pacific, supra, at para. 14). I also find that Mr. He\u2019s testimony was not persuasive. For these reasons, I find that no adjustment shall be made to the net worth calculations in that respect.\n\u00b7 Loan from Guo Lin He (in 2010)\n[133] Both Mr. Guo Lin He and Mr. He testified that Mr. Guo Lin He lent Mr. He a sum of $12,000 around 2009 or 2010. No loan documentation was provided at the hearing. Similar to Mr. He\u2019s testimony, Mr. Guo Lin He testified that since this loan was between family members, they did not prepare any loan documentation, and the money was loaned without interest.\n[134] Mr. He was unable to provide any particulars relating to the original loan, such as when exactly or how it was made.\n[135] A copy of a cheque for $12,000 dated March 7, 2011, issued by Mr. He to his cousin, Mr. Guo Lin He, was adduced at the hearing (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, p. 268). Mr. He testified that the cheque was issued to repay the loan.\n[136] According to the Appellant, a liability for $12,000 should be added to Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in 2010. In 2011, as the final repayment of the loan was made, no amount should appear as a liability on Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) in respect of that loan. Furthermore, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $12,000 in 2011, with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth).\n[137] Since Mr. He\u2019s testimony was largely corroborated by his cousin\u2019s testimony, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Loans from Biao Yang (or Bill Yang)\n[138] Mr. He testified that in 2011, he had received an amount of $15,300 as a loan from a friend, Mr. Yang, who is a real estate agent (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p. 270: cheque dated February 25, 2011). In that same year, the evidence showed that Mr. He made a cheque to Mr. Yang for $10,000 (Exhibit A-3, cheque dated June 28, 2011). Mr. He testified that the cheque was issued in partial repayment of the loan.\n[139] At the hearing, the Respondent agreed that the amount of $10,000 was added to the personal expenditures calculation. Mr. Battiste testified it was so included in 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 134).\n[140] According to the Appellant, in 2011 and 2012, the net result would be to add in Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) a liability in the net amount of $5,300 and to reduce the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) in the amount of $10,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for 2011.\n[141] Furthermore, Mr. He testified that in 2012, he had received an amount of $20,000 as an additional loan from Mr. Yang (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 18, p. 271: cheque dated February 28, 2012). In that same year, Mr. He made a cheque to Mr. Yang for the same amount (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p.272: cheque dated May 23, 2012).\n[142] Mr. Battiste testified that the amount of $20,000 was added to the personal expenditures calculation for 2012 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 17, p. 158).\n[143] According to the Appellant, no amount should be added to the liability section in Schedule II (Balance Sheet \u2013 Liabilities) for 2012, as the loan and the repayment were made within the same year. However, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $20,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth).\n[144] I agree with the Appellant\u2019s position. Since credible documentary evidence was adduced at trial to establish the existence of the loans and the repayment of the loans, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n(3) Additional adjustments to the calculation of personal expenditures (Schedule IV)\n\u00b7 Transfer to Fei Chen totalling $35,000\n[145] The evidence showed that Mr. He wrote two cheques to Mr. Chen, his nephew, in 2011:\n-a cheque dated January 10, 2011, for $18,000 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 20, p. 274); and\n-a cheque dated January 10, 2011, for $17,000 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 53, p. 995).\n[146] Mr. Battiste testified that these amounts were included in the calculation of personal expenditures for 2011 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, pp. 129 and 133) in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures).\n[147] Mr. He testified that he issued those two cheques totalling $35,000 to his nephew to assist him in purchasing a house. According to the Appellant, Mr. He acted as a conduit as Mr. Chen\u2019s family in China reimbursed his father-in-law in China.\n[148] Mr. Chen testified that his parents, who lived in China, arranged everything with his uncle, so Mr. He would transfer money to Mr. Chen to assist him in purchasing a house. Mr. Chen testified that his parents transferred funds to a person in China; in return, someone in Canada gave money to Mr. He so Mr. He would transfer funds to him. It was faster to proceed this way, and fees were less than if money was transferred directly from China.\n[149] According to the Appellant, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV \u2013(Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $35,000, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2011.\n[150] Although the testimony of both Mr. He and Mr. Chen was unclear, given the documentary evidence adduced at the hearing, I find that the Appellant\u2019s position must prevail, and therefore, the above-mentioned adjustments requested by the Appellant shall be made to the net worth calculations.\n\u00b7 Money order for $153,000 to Hui Ming Shi\n[151] Mr. He testified that he ordered his bank to issue a bank draft for $153,000 to Mr. Shi, his brother-in-law, in July 2009 (see the bank draft under Exhibit A\u20111, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 23). The bank draft was endorsed by Mr. Shi and is stamped July 15, 2009. Mr. He testified that this amount was likely a loan repayment. However, Mr. He testified that he was not able to provide any specific information and was uncertain of the nature of this amount, stating that his spouse may have been responsible for this amount.\n[152] However, at discovery, Mr. He stated that his father-in-law had him transfer that amount to his son in order to equalize money he had previously given to both his son and daughter (Answer to undertaking 8(b), Exhibit R-4, Respondent\u2019s Reads-In, p. 92).\n[153] At the hearing, Mr. Shi testified that the amount represented a loan from his brother-in-law to assist him in the purchase of a house. There were no repayment terms, nor was any loan documentation prepared in that respect. According to Mr. Shi\u2019s testimony, his father would take care of repaying that amount to Mr. He on his behalf. Mr. Shi never followed up with his father as to whether that amount had been reimbursed to Mr. He.\n[154] Further, Mr. Shi testified that there were no business dealings between him and his uncle.\n[155] The amount of the bank draft for $153,000 was considered a cash withdrawal by the CRA auditor and was included in the calculation of the personal expenditures for 2009 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 50, p. 609) in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures).\n[156] According to the Appellant, the amount of $153,000 should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures as either Mr. He was acting as a conduit to bring money from his father-in-law into Canada or that amount represents the repayment of a loan. In both cases, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) should be reduced by an amount of $153,000, with corresponding adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009.\n[157] For the following reasons, no adjustments will be made to the net worth calculations in respect of the bank draft. Mr. Shi and Mr. He gave conflicting testimonies on the nature of this transfer. Furthermore, Mr. He gave inconsistent statements during discovery regarding the nature of that same transfer. Owing to the conflicting testimonies, the Appellant did not satisfy me, on a balance of probabilities, that this amount should reduce the personal expenditures calculations.\n\u00b7 Payments totalling $3,033 made by Mr. He to Budget Rent-A-Car in 2010\n[158] The evidence showed that between July 2010 and December 2010, Mr. He rented a truck at the Budget Rent-A-Car branch located in Brampton and incurred expenses totalling $3,033 (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 19, p. 273, and Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, pp. 100 and 101; Tab 62, pp.1362, 1365, 1370, 1373, 1379 and 1383).\n[159] At the hearing, the Respondent stated that that amount was included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s personal expenditures for 2010 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 15, pp. 100\u2013101).\n[160] Mr. He testified that he was involved in the supermarket\u2019s management and was responsible for the frozen goods and dairy products. His partners were involved in other areas of the supermarket (vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, grocery, etc.). Being responsible for the dairy products and frozen goods, Mr. He had to visit suppliers, order goods, price them and organize shelves.\n[161] Mr. He testified that as Seasons had only one truck available for its business, he often had to rent a truck from Budget Rent-A-Car in Brampton to be able to visit suppliers and pick up and transport goods to the supermarket. He would pay these expenses with his VISA credit card (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 62, for the VISA credit card statements).\n[162] According to the Appellant, these amounts represent business expenses and should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures of Mr. He.\n[163] According to the Respondent, the evidence adduced at the hearing is not reliable, as Mr. He testified he had receipts from Seasons for these expenses but did not produce them at the hearing.\n[164] For the following reasons, I find Mr. He\u2019s evidence to be reliable and credible. Firstly, the truck was rented every week, in a constant manner. Also, the truck was rented from a Budget Rent-A-Car branch located in Brampton, near the supermarket, and not on the other side of Toronto in Scarborough, where Mr. He lives. Further, no amounts were expended before the supermarket opened in June of 2010.\n[165] Therefore, it is more likely than not these expenses are business expenses and not personal expenses for Mr. He. Accordingly, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) shall be reduced by an amount of $3,033 in 2010, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same year.\n\u00b7 Payments made by Mr. He to Costco totalling $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012\n[166] The evidence showed that Mr. He incurred expenses on his Costco AMEX credit card totalling $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012 at a Costco branch located in Brampton.\n[167] At the hearing, the Respondent stated that that amount was included in the calculation of Mr. He\u2019s personal expenditures for 2011 and 2012 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 16, p. 127; Tab 17, pp.151\u2013152). The Costco AMEX credit card statements were adduced under Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 65.\n[168] Mr. He testified that he would personally go to Costco to buy products for resale at the supermarket, because prices at Costco were often lower than those offered by his own suppliers. At Costco, Mr. He would pay with his personal AMEX Costco credit card, as Seasons was not in a financial position to have credit cards for its shareholders, being a newly incorporated corporation.\n[169] Mr. He would most of time go to the Costco store located in Brampton, which is close to the supermarket. Mr. He testified that the Costco purchases were actually purchases of goods for the supermarket and not for his personal use.\n[170] According to the Appellant, these amounts represent business expenses and should not be included in the calculation of the personal expenditures of Mr. He.\n[171] According to the Respondent, the evidence adduced at the hearing is not reliable, as Mr. He testified he had receipts from Seasons for these expenses but did not produce them at hearing.\n[172] For the following reasons, I find Mr. He\u2019s evidence to be reliable and credible. Firstly, I note that no amounts were expended in that respect before the supermarket was opened. Further, the expenses were incurred in Brampton, where the supermarket is located, and not in Scarborough, where Mr. He lives.\n[173] Therefore, it is more likely than not that these expenses are business expenses and not personal expenses. Accordingly, the personal expenditures in Schedule IV (Summary of Personal Expenditures) shall be reduced by an amount of $29,524 in 2011 and $23,314 in 2012, with corresponding adjustments in Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) for the same years.\n(4) Additional adjustments to Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth)\n\u00b7 Cheque for $4,269.95 issued by the Government of Canada in 2009\n[174] Evidence showed that Mr. He received a cheque for $4,269.95 from the Government of Canada in August 2009 (Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 53, p. 885). The cheque was deposited in Mr. He\u2019s CIBC account (#6151) (Exhibit A-1, Appellant\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 22, p. 277).\n[175] The cheque seems to be a GST rebate payment made by the Government of Canada to Mr. He in respect of the Telegram Mews Property. Upon the sale of the Telegram Mews Property, that amount was included in the calculation of outlays and expenses (see Exhibit R-1, Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents, Tab 10, p. 46).\n[176] According to the Appellant, that amount should be considered an additional deduction on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009. However, the Respondent argued that since that amount had reduced the capital gains on the sale of Telegram Mews Property, it should not be taken into account as a deduction.\n[177] I agree with the Appellant. The amount of $4,269.95 is a refund received by Mr. He and shall be taken into account as an additional deduction on Schedule III (Calculation of Discrepancy in Total Income per Net Worth) in 2009.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J.\nSchedule A\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 21\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2018-4775(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nYu Xing He v.

Introduction\n[1] There is no disagreement concerning the facts. There is no disagreement concerning the figures.\n[2] In 2008, the appellant purchased a duplex in Montreal.\n[3] He occupied the lower unit as his principal residence and he rented out the upper unit to other people.\n[4] In 2017, the appellant stopped renting out the upper unit. He did some renovations in order to transform the duplex into a single-family residence.\n[5] After the changes were made, the appellant used the single-family residence as his principal residence. There was therefore a change of use in 2017.\n[6] The transformation in 2017 triggered a deemed disposition resulting from the change of partial use, and therefore a capital gain and a taxable capital gain.\n[7] In June 2018, the appellant filed his tax return for the 2017 taxation year, in which he declared a capital gain in connection with the change of use and did not ask that the capital gain be deferred under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\n[8] The Minister\u2019s initial assessment accepted the appellant\u2019s tax return as filed.\n[9] On November 13, 2018, the appellant served a notice of objection in order to make his election under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\n[10] The Minister confirmed the initial assessment.\n[11] The appellant argued that under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act, he was entitled to elect to defer the capital gain.\n[12] The respondent made the opposite argument. In the respondent\u2019s submission, the election was available only if there was a change of use of the entire property, the duplex.\n[13] Amendments were made to subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act that came into force after March 18, 2019.\n[14] At the end of 2017, subsection 45(3) read as follows:\n(3) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[15] At present, paragraph 45(3) reads as follows:\n(3) If at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income, or that was acquired in part for that purpose, ceases in whole or in part to be used for that purpose and becomes, or becomes part of, the principal residence of the taxpayer, paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[16] If the change of use had taken place after March 18, 2019, there would be no doubt that the appellant could have deferred the capital gain.\n[17] One consequence of the interpretation by the Canada Revenue Agency is that the taxpayer must pay the tax despite the fact that he did not sell the property, and in his financial circumstances, this could cause him cash flow problems. While that may be so, a cash flow problem can arise in various situations in which the Act creates a deemed disposition.\n[18] This is a somewhat surprising outcome, given that an individual who rents out a house that he owns and changes the use of the house to make it his principal residence may make the election and avoid it triggering a deemed disposition.[1]\nII. Analysis[2]\n[19] No conclusions may be drawn regarding the prior rights from the fact that the Act was amended with effect as of March 18, 2019.[3]\n[20] It is agreed that provisions must be interpreted using a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole.[4]\n[21] In interpreting subsection 45(3), it is important to consider the text of section 45 of the Income Tax Act, as it read at the end of 2017, as a whole:\nProperty with more than one use\n45 (1) For the purposes of this subdivision the following rules apply:\n(a) where a taxpayer,\n(i) having acquired property for some other purpose, has commenced at a later time to use it for the purpose of gaining or producing income, or\n(ii) having acquired property for the purpose of gaining or producing income, has commenced at a later time to use it for some other purpose,\nthe taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(iii) disposed of it at that later time for proceeds equal to its fair market value at that later time, and\n(iv) immediately thereafter reacquired it at a cost equal to that fair market value;\n(b) where property has, since it was acquired by a taxpayer, been regularly used in part for the purpose of gaining or producing income and in part for some other purpose, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired, for that other purpose, the proportion of the property that the use regularly made of the property for that other purpose is of the whole use regularly made of the property at a cost to the taxpayer equal to the same proportion of the cost to the taxpayer of the whole property, and, if the property has, in such a case, been disposed of, the proceeds of disposition of the proportion of the property deemed to have been acquired for that other purpose shall be deemed to be the same proportion of the proceeds of disposition of the whole property;\n(c) where, at any time after a taxpayer has acquired property, there has been a change in the relation between the use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for gaining or producing income and the use regularly made of the property for other purposes,\n(i) if the use regularly made of the property for those other purposes has increased, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(A) disposed of the property at that time for proceeds equal to the proportion of the fair market value of the property at that time that the amount of the increase in the use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for those other purposes is of the whole use regularly made of the property, and\n(B) immediately thereafter reacquired the property so disposed of at a cost equal to the proceeds referred to in clause 45(1)(c)(i)(A), and\n(ii) if the use regularly made of the property for those other purposes has decreased, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have\n(A) disposed of the property at that time for proceeds equal to the proportion of the fair market value of the property at that time that the amount of the decrease in use regularly made by the taxpayer of the property for those other purposes is of the whole use regularly made of the property, and\n(B) immediately thereafter reacquired the property so disposed of at a cost equal to the proceeds referred to in clause 45(1)(c)(ii)(A); and\n(d) in applying this subsection in respect of a non-resident taxpayer, a reference to \u201cgaining or producing income\u201d shall be read as a reference to \u201cgaining or producing income from a source in Canada\u201d.\nElection where change of use\n(2) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\nElection concerning principal residence\n(3) Where at any time a property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose and becomes the principal residence of the taxpayer, subsection 45(1) shall not apply to deem the taxpayer to have disposed of the property at that time and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter if the taxpayer so elects by notifying the Minister in writing on or before the earlier of\n(a) the day that is 90 days after a demand by the Minister for an election under this subsection is sent to the taxpayer, and\n(b) the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the taxation year in which the property is actually disposed of by the taxpayer.\nWhere election cannot be made\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection 45(3), an election described in that subsection shall be deemed not to have been made in respect of a change in use of property if any deduction in respect of the property has been allowed for any taxation year ending after 1984 and on or before the change in use under regulations made under paragraph 20(1)(a) to the taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a trust under which the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner is a beneficiary.\n[22] Subsection 45(1) contains general rules that apply to changes in the use of a property, from use for the purpose of gaining or producing income to use for some other purpose, and vice versa.\n[23] Paragraph 45(1)(a) applies when a property that is acquired for a single purpose is subsequently used solely for the other purpose. The paragraph deems a disposition.\n[24] Paragraph 45(1)(b) applies when the property is to be used for both purposes at the time of the acquisition. This paragraph operates to divide the cost of acquisition between the two purposes.\n[25] Paragraph 45(1)(c) deems a disposition when there is a change in the percentage of the use of the property for each purpose.[5]\n[26] Subsections 45(2) and (3) allow a taxpayer to defer deemed dispositions in certain circumstances. Subsection 45(2) is not relevant in this case.\n[27] The key question could be summarized as follows. Must the phrase:\na property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose\nbe understood as if it read:\na property that was acquired by a taxpayer exclusively for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose?\n[28] I can understand how the phrase \u201ca property that was acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income ceases to be used for that purpose\u201d could be read, at first glance, as applying only in circumstances in which the property was acquired exclusively for the purpose of gaining or producing income, that is, the situation described in subparagraph 45(1)(a)(ii).\n[29] For one thing, the fact that paragraphs 45(1)(a) and (c) deal separately with changes from one single purpose to the other single purpose and with changes in the proportion of use for each purpose, respectively, could suggest that Parliament had planned to address these two situations separately within subsection 45(3) if its intention was to allow the election in subsection 45(3) in both situations.\n[30] Having regard to the general scheme of section 45, I am satisfied, for the following reasons, that subsection 45(3) of the Act also applies in the fact situation in this appeal.\n[31] First, while it was necessary to separate subsections 45(1)(a) and (c) since the consequences of the two types of deemed dispositions, in terms of their effects, are different, no such separation was necessary in drafting subsection 45(3), because the consequence is simply to defer the disposition in both cases.\n[32] I note that subsection 45(3) is not limited to paragraph 45(1)(a); that subsection contains the phrase \u201csubsection 45(1) shall not apply...\u201d.\n[33] Second, the objective of subsection 45(3) when it was added in 1985 was to allow deemed dispositions of a residential property to be deferred when the property became a principal residence and subsection 45(4) did not apply.[6]\n[34] Although the technical notes talk about a residential property, there is nothing to suggest that the amendments were intended to exclude conversion of part of the property, for example half of a duplex.\n[35] An interpretation that excludes a partial change of use is contrary to the objective intended when subsection 45(3) was added.[7]\n[36] Third, I do not see how it could be said that once the taxpayer ceased to rent out the upper part of the property he did not cease to use the property for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The taxpayer is no longer receiving a penny of income.\n[37] The appeal is therefore allowed, without costs, and the matter is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the appellant was entitled to make the election and defer the capital gain under subsection 45(3) of the Income Tax Act.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 20th day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

The courts may consider those administrative positions.\nThe respondent\u2019s representative produced various documents in the course of his submissions; while these are not evidence, to facilitate identification of the documents they were identified as A\u20111 to A\u201114.\nAt one time, the CRA took the administrative position that the election could be made in circumstances such as those in issue here. However, the CRA changed its position well before 2017. The ARQ seems to be of the contrary opinion; however, the ARQ seems to have followed the CRA under the provisions relating to \u201crelated elections\u201d. See the last page of Exhibit A\u20115.\n[3] See section 45 of the Interpretation Act and paragraph 86 of Canada v. Oxford Properties Group 2018 FCA 30 (CanLII).\n[4] See, for example, Minister of National Revenue v. Al Saunders Contracting & Consulting Inc. 2020 FCA 89 at paragraph 20 or Canada v. BCS Group Business Services Inc., 2020 FCA (CanLII) at paragraph 21, in which the Federal Court of Appeal summarizes the principles of interpretation as follows:\nThe modern approach to statutory interpretation is well established. The words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object and the intention of Parliament. This means that one must read the text, taking into account the purpose of the Act and of the provision at issue and all relevant context, including established common law and civil law concepts unless these are clearly ousted by legislation.\n[5] Paragraph 45(1)(d) is of no relevance in this case.\n[6] See the technical notes dated September 9, 1985, provided by the Minister of Finance. It is agreed that the Court may consider technical notes: Silicon Graphics Ltd v. R., 2002 FCA 260.\n[7] As well, in the context of section 45, the ordinary meaning of property acquired \u201cfor the purpose of gaining or producing income\u201d does not exclude property acquired in part for the purpose of gaining or producing income.\n",

TRIPLETT,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nJorr\u00e9 J.\n[1] The circumstances surrounding this appeal are extremely unfortunate. At the end of these reasons, I will make some comments about these circumstances and I would urge the parties to carefully consider them.\n[2] I would also suggest policy makers seriously consider the possibility of amendments regarding when elections must be made under section 217 of the Income Tax Act.\n[3] The Appellant appeals from non-resident withholding tax assessments dated 26 February 2018 with respect to the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 taxation years.\n[4] The Appellant is a retired teacher who resided in Canada until 11 October 2011. He moved to the United States and became a non-resident of Canada.\n[5] In May and June 2016, respectively, the Minister of National revenue wrote to the Appellant regarding unfiled T1 returns for the years 2011 to 2014 inclusive.\n[6] The Minister first became aware of the Appellant\u2019s change in residency in June 2016.\n[7] In July 2016 the Appellant filed T1 tax returns for all the years in issue and he filed them in the same way as if he had still been a resident. His income consisted of superannuation benefits and in the 2015 taxation year only some RRSP income.\n[8] In March 2017 the Minister assessed the five taxation years as filed. Those assessments resulted in no tax owing. Presumably, this was because the tax withheld by the payors of the pension and of the RRSP payments together with personal credits resulted in no tax payable.\n[9] In February 2018, the Minister issued failure to remit assessments for Part XIII non-resident withholding tax with respect to the five years in issue.\n[10] The amounts assessed are in the right-hand column of the table at paragraph 18 of the affidavit of Elaine Armstrong-Kyne.\n[11] As can be seen from the table, those amounts have been computed in each year by determining the applicable non-resident withholding tax[1] on the payments in the year and deducting therefrom the amounts that were withheld at source. I will refer to those amounts withheld as the additional withholding amounts.\n[12] The Appellant duly objected to these assessments and the Minister subsequently confirmed them except in the case of the 2011 tax year.\n[13] In the 2011 tax year, the Minister accepted that the taxpayer had resided in Canada until October and recomputed the withholding tax amounts accordingly. This was to the taxpayer\u2019s benefit insofar as the 2011 non-resident withholding tax had originally been computed for the entire year.\n[14] Nothing in the evidence has convinced me that there was any error by the Minister in the computation of the tax.\n[15] The purpose of section 217 of the Income Tax Act is to put certain non-resident individuals in a position where they are generally no worse off than if they were still residents.\n[16] Given the Appellant\u2019s income sources, had he made a timely election to benefit from the alternative provided for in section 217 of the Income Tax Act, he would have avoided having to pay the additional withholding amounts levied. This result stems from the fact that, generally, this alternative allows a taxpayer to keep the usual deductions.\n[17] Section 217 is optional because for some non-resident taxpayers, given their circumstances, it would be disadvantages for them to choose the alternative.\n[18] Unfortunately, section 217 required that the Appellant file a Part I tax return within six months of the end of the year and elect in that return to have section 217 apply for the tax year.[2]\n[19] That means that the Appellant would have had to file his return and make an election in respect of the last of the years in issue, 2015, on or before 30 June 2016.\n[20] Given that the returns for all of the years in issue were filed on 20 July 2016, it was by then already too late to make an election under section 217.\n[21] The result is that the assessments for the years are correct in fact and law and there is no basis for overturning the assessments.\n[22] I now turn to evidence that the Appellant gave in relation to the many difficulties that he had in obtaining information on how to proceed together with arguments he raised based on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\n[23] I accept the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he had great difficulties in obtaining information, that there were delays and that the information was not always helpful.\n[24] However, notwithstanding its name, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is not a law and does not give rise to legal rights. It is more in the nature of an aspirational document and it would probably be better if the document were given a different name.\n[25] This court is one of limited jurisdiction and the essence of its jurisdiction is to determine whether assessments are correct based on the facts relevant to the applicable law; it can confirm or modify assessments but its decision cannot take account of other factors.\n[26] The consequence is that all the Appellant\u2019s difficulties are not relevant to the decision I must make.\n[27] The Appellant also testified as to the serious hardship that the assessments in question have caused for him and for his spouse.\n[28] While the Appellant appears to be in an extremely difficult situation given the amount owing in relation to his income, it is not something that I can consider for the purposes of the determination that I must make.\n[29] However, with respect to hardship, there are provisions which allow the Minister to waive interest and penalties in certain circumstances\u2014see subsection 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act. I am pleased to note that the Minister proactively waived interest for a certain period because of delays that took place earlier.\n[30] The Appellant can certainly make a request to the CRA for further relief under that provision. This court has no jurisdiction with respect to such matters.[3]\n[31] There is, however, a 10-year restriction; requests must be made within 10 calendar years after the taxation year. The Appellant can obtain more information regarding how the Minister approaches such requests by obtaining from the CRA Information Circular 07-1R 1\u2014Taxpayer Relief Provisions; there is also a related form RC 4288\u2014Request for taxpayer relief.\n[32] Before concluding, I wish to observe that, given the objectives of section 217, it is surprising that there is no possibility of electing section 217 any later than June 30 of the following calendar year.\n[33] The Appellant fits very well into the profile of the kind of taxpayer whom section 217 was intended to benefit.\n[34] In this case losing the ability to make such an election had a dramatic negative effect on the Appellant.\n[35] The withholdings already made by the payors of the Appellant\u2019s pension payments and RRSP payment were sufficient to cover all the Appellant\u2019s income tax had he been able to take advantage of section 217. At no time would the public purse have been out of pocket.\n[36] Given that, I find it hard to imagine what harm there might be if there were some way to extend the time to elect section 217 in circumstances such as those of this Appellant.[4]\n[37] The relatively short limit is also surprising given that, generally, an individual who fails to claim something could do so by filing an objection. Such an individual always has until at least one year after the filing due date.[5]\n[38] It is also surprising, given that for many things a taxpayer has the possibility of persuading the Minister to exercise the Minister\u2019s discretion to reassess, with the consent of the taxpayer, for a ten-year period.[6]\n[39] Policymakers and Parliament may wish to consider whether there should be amendments to give a longer period for making an election under section 217 or whether the Minister should have the ability to extend the time.[7]\n[40] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 22nd day of February 2024.\n\u201cG.

This was raised as an issue in Mr. Ferri\u2019s Notice of Appeal. His testimony was that he took no active steps to prevent the company\u2019s failure to remit. There wasn\u2019t even evidence that in 1997 to 1999, when he admits to having been a director, systems were in place to ensure regular reporting to the board that all remittances were made when due and continued to be up to date.\n[4] In this appeal the appellant has the burden of proof to satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that the answer to at least one of the two questions above absolve him from director\u2019s liability under section 227.1.\nI. The Relevant Jurisprudence [5] The purpose of the directors\u2019 liability provisions of Canadian tax legislation has been described in Deakin 2012 TCC 270 as:\n[13] An employer is generally required by law to remit to the CRA the source deductions it has withheld from its employees\u2019 salaries and wages for income tax, CPP and EI deductions. This obligation differs from the employer\u2019s liability for its own taxes on its income. These amounts were withheld from the employees to be remitted to CRA and CRA, and hence Canadian taxpayers at large, give the employees credit for these amounts against the employees\u2019 tax liabilities. For this reason, the legislation gives CRA greater collection powers for such unremitted amounts than for the employer\u2019s own income taxes.\n[14] Similarly, a business is generally required to remit the amount of GST it collected from its customers, net of the GST the business paid on its purchases, supplies and inputs. The GST was collected by the business from its customers to be remitted to the CRA to satisfy the customers\u2019 GST liabilities. Again, recognizing this, the legislation gives CRA greater collection powers for such unremitted GST amounts.\n[15] Subsection 227.1 of the ITA and subsection 323 of the ETA provide that the directors of a corporation will be personally liable for a corporation\u2019s failure to remit employee withholdings and GST as required by law. Directors are not generally liable for a corporation\u2019s own income tax. The potential liability of directors reflects the degree of management and control directors have over a corporation\u2019s management and its affairs.\n[16] Subsections 227.1(3) of the ITA and 323(3) of the ETA each provide that a director will not be liable for the corporation\u2019s failure to remit such amounts as required by law if the director exercised a degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances.\n[17] The Federal Court of Appeal most recently had the occasion to consider the due diligence defence of directors for unremitted source deductions and GST in Her Majesty the Queen v. Buckingham, 2011 FCA 142. In that case, the Court wrote:\n\u2026\n[33] On the other hand, subsection 227.1(1) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 323(1) of the Excise Tax Act specifically provide that the directors \"are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable, together with the corporation, to pay the amount and any interest or penalties relating to\" the remittances the corporation is required to make. Subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act do not set out a general duty of care, but rather provide for a defence to the specific liability set out in subsections 227.1(1) and 323(1) of these respective Acts, and the burden is on the directors to prove that the conditions required to successfully plead such a defence have been met. The duty of care in subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act also specifically targets the prevention of the failure by the corporation to remit identified tax withholdings, including notably employee source deductions. Subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act has a similarly focus. The directors must thus establish that they exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill required \"to prevent the failure\". The focus of these provisions is clearly on the prevention of failures to remit.\n\u2026\n[40] The focus of the inquiry under subsections 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act will however be different than that under 122(1)(b) of the CBCA, since the former require that the director's duty of care, diligence and skill be exercised to prevent failures to remit. In order to rely on these defences, a director must thus establish that he turned his attention to the required remittances and that he exercised his duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts.\n\u2026\n[49] The traditional approach has been that a director's duty is to prevent the failure to remit, not to condone it in the hope that matters can be rectified subsequently: Canada v. Corsano, 1999 CanLII 9297 (FCA), [1999] 3 F.C. 173 (C.A.) at para. 35, Ruffo v. Canada, 2000 CanLII 15199 (FCA), 2000 D.T.C. 6317, [2000] 4 C.T.C. 39 (F.C.A.). Contrary to the suppliers of a corporation who may limit their financial exposure by requiring cash-in-advance payments, the Crown is an involuntary creditor. The level of the Crown's exposure to the corporation can thus increase if the corporation continues its operations by paying the net salaries of the employees without effecting employee source deductions remittances, or if the corporation decides to collect GST\/HST from customers without reporting and remitting these amounts in a timely fashion. In circumstances where a corporation is facing financial difficulties, it may be tempting to divert these Crown remittances in order to pay other creditors and thus ensure the continuation of the operations of the corporation. It is precisely such a situation which both section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act and section 323 of the Excise Tax Act seek to avoid. The defence under subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act and under subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act should not be used to encourage such failures by allowing a due diligence defence for directors who finance the activities of their corporation with Crown monies on the expectation that the failures to remit could eventually be cured.\n\u2026\n[52] Parliament did not require that directors be subject to an absolute liability for the remittances of their corporations. Consequently, Parliament has accepted that a corporation may, in certain circumstances, fail to effect remittances without its directors incurring liability. What is required is that the directors establish that they were specifically concerned with the tax remittances and that they exercised their duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts.\n\u2026\n[56] A director of a corporation cannot justify a defence under the terms of subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act where he condones the continued operation of the corporation by diverting employee source deductions to other purposes. The entire scheme of section 227.1 of the Income Tax Act, read as a whole, is precisely designed to avoid such situations. In this case, though the respondent had a reasonable (but erroneous) expectation that the sale of the online course development division could result in a large payment which could be used to satisfy creditors, he consciously transferred part of the risks associated with this transaction to the Crown by continuing operations knowing that employee source deductions would not be remitted. This is precisely the mischief which subsection 227.1 of the Income Tax Act seeks to avoid.\n\u2026\n[57] Once the trial judge found as a matter of fact that the respondent's efforts after February 2003 were no longer directed towards the avoidance of failures to remit, no successful defence under either subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act or subsection 323(3) of the Excise Tax Act could be sustained.\n[Emphasis added]\n\u2026\n[23] Given the specific wording of the subsections and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s comments in Buckingham, it appears somewhat difficult to imagine circumstances in which an informed and active owner-manager and director of a corporation will not be liable for unremitted employee source deductions and unremitted GST amounts. As mentioned above, the scope of the Worrell exception post-Buckingham remains to be developed in other cases than the Deakins\u2019.\n[24] Source deductions and GST remittances are required by law to be made by a business corporation. These are not the corporation\u2019s own funds. The corporation has collected them from its employees and customers. Those employees and customers are given credit for these amounts once withheld and collected, even when not remitted. When owner-managers and directors decide to use these funds to keep their business afloat and support their investments, they are making all Canadian taxpayers invest involuntarily in a business and investment in which they have no upside. In doing so, shareholders and corporate decision-makers are investing or gambling with other people\u2019s money. Directors should be aware of that when they cause or permit this to happen. The directors\u2019 liability provisions of the legislation should be regarded by business persons as somewhat similar to a form of personal guarantee by the directors that can expose them to comparable liability for the amount involved. It is they who are deciding to invest the funds in their own business, for their own gain, not the government or people of Canada. They are doing so contrary to clear law and it appears appropriate as a policy matter that Parliament has legislated clearly that they will generally be responsible for such decisions and the loss resulting from them. In essence, if a corporation and its directors choose to unilaterally \u201cborrow\u201d from Canadian taxpayers and the public purse, Canadians get the benefit of security akin to personal guarantees of the directors.\n[6] The Federal Court of Appeal in HMQ v. Chriss 2016 FCA 236 wrote about the requirement, at least under Ontario law, that a resignation is not effective in the absence of a written resignation to the corporation. That Court wrote:\n[11] The reasons underlying the requirement of a written resignation which is communicated to the company are self-evident. Third parties rely on representations as to who is responsible for the governance of a corporation. Business decisions may be made on the basis of directorship of a corporation.\n[12] Many laws attach liability to former directors within a certain period of time after resignations; see, for example, Employment Standards Act, 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 41, Part XIV.2. So too does the Income Tax Act subsection 227.1(4) of which provides a two-year limitation period on actions for recovery of amounts owing by directions. The two years is triggered by the date of resignation.\n[13] This limitation period demands, for its application, precision in the date of resignation. If a director has resigned, the Crown may no longer be able to look to the director for unremitted taxes, and other directors may have to absorb the director\u2019s share of such liability. Further, there is a two-year limitation period which constrains the Minister\u2019s ability to initiate proceedings against directors for unremitted source deduction.\n[14] It is thus self-evident that the status of directors must be capable of objective verification. Reliance on the subjective intention or say-so of a director alone would allow a director to plant the seeds of retroactive resignation, only to rely on it at some later date should a director-linked liability emerge. The facts of this case illustrate why subsection 121(2) of the OBCA has been drafted the way it is: the dangers associated with allowing anything less than delivery of an executed and dated written resignation are unacceptable.\n[15] There was no \u201cwritten resignation received by the corporation\u201d within the meaning of subsection 121(2). Unsigned letters of resignation with no effective date, were found in the solicitor\u2019s file, thus, the judge erred in concluding that the intention of the respondents\u2019 to resign satisfied the necessary preconditions of an effective resignation.\n\u2026\n[18] The scope of the due diligence defence is informed by the nature or subject matter of the director\u2019s responsibility in question. Here, the question in respect of which due diligence is raised is fundamental to corporate governance \u2013 am I or am I not a director? There can be no ambiguity in the answer to that question.\n[19] A director\u2019s belief that they have resigned has no correspondence or connection to the underlying purposes of subsection 121(2) of the OBCA and its emphasis on an objectively verifiable communication of a resignation to the corporation. To allow a subjective intention to suddenly spring to life, when, in the affairs of the corporation, or in the interests of the director, it is convenient to do so, would significantly undermine corporate governance. A reasonable belief that one has resigned must hew much closer to the requirements for an actual effective resignation. In addition, there was no communication of the resignation to the corporation. The draft letters never left the solicitor\u2019s office. The requirement that the resignations be received by the corporation cannot be ignored.\n[20] Secondly, due diligence defences arise only by virtue of subsection 227.1(3) of the Income Tax Act. The scope of defence is thus informed by, or takes its shape in light of, the obligations in question. In Canada v. Buckingham, 2011 FCA 142 this Court gave clear direction with respect to the interpretation of the due diligence defence in subsection 227.1(3). The Court held, at paragraph 37, that \u201cthe standard of care, skill and diligence required under subsection 227.1(3) [\u2026] is an objective standard as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Peoples Department Stores.\u201d This objective standard is evaluated against a reasonably prudent person \u201cin comparable circumstances.\u201d The Income Tax Act is a key contextual element, which \u201crequires more of directors and officers than the traditional common law duty of care.\u201d More particularly, to satisfy the defence in subsection 227.1(3), \u201ca director must thus establish that he turned his attention to the required remittances and that he exercised his duty of care, diligence and skill with a view to preventing a failure by the corporation to remit the concerned amounts\u201d (at para. 40).\n[21] As noted by the Court in Buckingham, a higher standard is an incentive for corporations to improve the quality of board decisions through the establishment of good corporate governance rules and discourages the appointment of inactive directors who fail to discharge their duties as director by leaving decisions to the active directors. One consequence of this is that a person who is appointed as a director must carry out the duties of that function on an active basis and will not be allowed to defend a claim for malfeasance in the discharge of his or her duties by relying on his or her own inaction.\n\u2026\n[24] Directors must carry out their duties on an active basis. A director cannot raise a due diligence defence by relying on their own indifferent or casual attitude to their responsibilities. A reasonable director would insist on being satisfied that their intention to resign had been effected.\n\u2026\n[31] If a corporation faces bankruptcy and a third party offers the corporation a reprieve from bankruptcy if the corporation dips into what is, in effect, a trust account held for the benefit of its employees, as is the case here, the law is clear as to the obligations of the directors. They must not take from or dissipate the employee deductions. If they diverge from the course of action the law prescribes, they do so at their peril.\n(emphasis added)\n[7] More recently the Federal Court of Appeal wrote in Cliff v. HMQ 2022 FCA 16 at paragraph 15:\n[15] Form 1 is not a resignation; rather, it is a notice entitled \u201cInitial Return\/Notice of Change\u201d. Nor is it a communication to the corporation; rather it is a communication from the corporation to the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations. While Form 1 indicates that the appellant ceased to be a director on December 12, 2003, there is no evidence as to when Form 1 was completed and there is no place on the Form 1 for a director\u2019s signature, physical or digital or otherwise. For a resignation to be effective, there must be evidence that the corporation received a written resignation confirming that the appellant has resigned. While Form 1 may reflect something that may have happened, it is not a substitute for a written resignation.\nII. Findings and Conclusion [8] For the reasons that follow, Mr. Ferri\u2019s appeal is dismissed.\n[9] I have concluded that Mr. Ferri\u2019s evidence on the two issues above do not rise to the level needed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he was not still a director when the requisite remittances were not made, or that he had not been a director in the two years prior to the assessments being issued.\n[10] Mr. Ferri acknowledged that he was a director starting in May 1997 but maintained that he resigned as director on October 31, 1999 when he said that he delivered his written resignation to the corporation\u2019s lawyer, Paul Leon. Mr. Ferri said Mr. Leon told him that the requisite Ontario Form 1 Notice of Change had been filed.\n[11] When Mr. Ferri became aware in 2007 that the Ontario provincial registry continued to show him as a director, Mr. Ferri said that he mailed a second Form 1 Notice of Change to the Ontario provincial authorities again with an effective date of October 31, 1999 \u2014 even though he said he had obtained a copy of the original Form 1 from Mr. Leon in 2005 for some reason.\n[12] Provincial corporate registries are not determinative on the issue of whether a person is or is not a director for purposes of the director liability provisions of the Act. However, it is clear that neither of the 1999 or 2007 Form 1 notices of resignation were reflected in the Ontario registry.\n[13] Mr. Leon testified and acknowledged that he was the corporation\u2019s lawyer. He had been able to find the 1999 Form 1 in his file but nothing else and has no specific recollections. His file did not have a copy of a resignation (draft or signed), a cover letter or email to the provincial registrar for the Form 1, or a note from him or his assistant that it was ever sent. He did not have any corporate resolution or other communication acknowledging or accepting the resignation or appointing any new director, nor any communication from him to his client (the corporation) regarding one of its directors resigning. He did not have the minute book nor did he know what his office had done with it even though he continued for a period of time as the corporation\u2019s lawyer.\n[14] Neither Mr. Leon or Mr. Ferri satisfied me they had used their best efforts to try to locate such potentially important evidence, even after the Court noted this and offered to reopen evidence if efforts were made, whether successful or not. This offer was not taken up.\n[15] Mr. Leon said he would have instructed his secretary to prepare and file a Form 1 upon receiving Mr. Ferri\u2019s 1999 resignation. He said he was contacted years later by Mr. Ferri concerned that his resignation had not been filed and that is when he faxed Mr. Ferri a copy of the Form 1 and confirmed that it had been sent to the Ontario Ministry. I take it from Mr. Ferri\u2019s evidence that this was in 2005. There is no evidence that Mr. Leon had or had sent Mr. Ferri anything other than the Form 1. The Court was not provided with any other evidence from the Ontario Ministry than printed out corporate profile pages. It appears no actual file records were sought from the Ontario Ministry.\n[16] Mr. Ferri acknowledged he did not send a copy of his resignation or any communication about it to the corporation, to the individual he said replaced him as a director, or to the corporation\u2019s shareholders, the largest of which he said he represented. He did not ask anyone at the corporation to have him removed as director \u2014 even after his concerns that Mr. Leon might not have done so.\n[17] No one was identified by Mr. Ferri or was called as a witness by him who knew more about the corporation than himself, or who understood or knew who really ran at. Mr. Ferri maintained that after October 1999 he was merely a financial consultant to the company, but was guarded and I believe less than candid about who else he knew to be running the corporation. The evidence was clear that Mr. Ferri was operating at a functional level well above Ms. Karen Chambers, who was the corporation\u2019s office manager throughout the relevant period up until 2014 or 2015 when she bought the business in an asset purchase and continues to run it. Her role as office manager was described as essentially being the chief operating officer for the corporation.\n[18] Ms. Chambers also testified. I found her answers to be relatively forthcoming and credible. Ms. Chambers told Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) during the relevant years that Mr. Ferri was a director. She had replied on Mr. Ferri\u2019s behalf to CRA communications directed to the corporation or Mr. Ferri about the unremitted withholdings. She said she would not have done this, or negotiated the repayment schedule with CRA for these years without Mr. Ferri\u2019s knowledge. She was certain she would have asked for and obtained his advice and opinions on that topic. She said Mr. Ferri was involved in all big decision\u2011making such as financial statements, books and records, shareholder dividends, and bonuses. She said she always assumed Mr. Ferri was a director even though she was not privy to the corporate minute book, and she may have obtained this information from a corporate profile. Ms. Chambers said she had never met Sam Mingle, the person Mr. Ferri said replaced him as director in 1999. In answer to one of my questions to her following redirect, Ms. Chambers shared that her new metal stamping company, which continued the North American Tool and Die business, rented its premises from Mr. Ferri \u2014 that he was her landlord, and that Mr. Ferri or his counsel had, since 2017, approached her to clarify her understanding of events. She said this possibly extended beyond the information in the corporate profile she was given to prove she was in error thinking and telling others that Mr. Ferri was a director. She said she was given the corporate profile but had still never seen the minute book or other corporate records. She did not receive the corporate minute book as part of her asset purchase of the business, which is understandable.\n[19] I infer from Ms. Chambers\u2019 evidence and her letter that she had been informed as office manager that Mr. Ferri was a director following his 1997 appointment and that she never had reason to believe he had ceased to be a director when she sent her letter to CRA based on his involvement and interaction with her, the corporaton and its new shareholder that he represented.\n[20] The fact that Sam Mingle was not called as a witness to corroborate that he was appointed to the board to replace Mr. Ferri in 1999, nor was any other witness associated with the corporation\u2019s ownership or governance, is strongly suggestive that would not be their testimony. Nor was any witness called from whichever law firm acted as corporate counsel after Mr. Leon ceased to represent it in 1999. The testimony of Mr. Ferri and Mr. Leon was somewhat light on their efforts to locate it, or why it may have perished in a house fire.\n[21] I did not find Mr. Ferri to be an entirely candid and credible witness. He frequently said he did not recall things, even though he remembered other things very clearly from the same period. He was at best guarded in disclosing who was behind the new shareholder of the corporation, even though he represented them and was paid by them. Mr. Ferri was at times non responsive in his answers, or evasive, and was instead inclined to repeat his version of events when questioned about other things. Mr. Ferri only acknowledged in cross-examination that he had lost his Chartered Accountant designation for moral turpitude, unacceptable behavior and professional misconduct for his role in the Astra Trust Company financial scandal of the early 1980s. Mr. Ferri was charged, convicted and incarcerated for his role in the Astra Trust scandal. He says he was later pardoned. He was not initially forthcoming about having subsequently been charged with extortion, fraud or theft involving another financial institution, though he testified those later charges were dismissed.\n[22] He was notably evasive, difficult and avoidant when asked about the nature of his later business consulting. He didn\u2019t recall if he ever owned a business, and if he could have been a shareholder of any private companies, nor did he recall which corporations he was ever a director of, acknowledging only that he had held directorships at various periods of time, and could not recall if he had been a director of any since 1999.\n[23] There are inconsistencies within Mr. Ferri\u2019s testimony and his notice of appeal. He appears to have tried to file a Form 1 removing himself as director but leaving himself as President and Secretary even though he said he did not hold those roles.\n[24] With respect to Sam Mingle replacing Mr. Ferri as director in October 1999, it is noteworthy that the Ontario provincial registry shows Mr. Mingle was recorded to have been added as director by 2014, but Mr. Ferri still remained recorded as director. This was not explained. Further, provincial records show entries that Mr. Ferri continued to file the corporation\u2019s Annual Returns with the province after October 1999.\n[25] In these circumstances, there is simply insufficient credible, consistent, reliable evidence to allow the Court to conclude on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Ferri delivered a written resignation as director to the corporation effective October 31, 1999. Similarly, the Court is unable to conclude on a balance of probabilities that any of the Form 1s reporting Mr. Ferri\u2019s removal as director were filed with the Ministry prior to 2017.\n[26] A Form 1, even accepting the date on it, that was the sole relevant document in the corporate counsel\u2019s file is not evidence sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Ferri ceased to be a director on that date, especially where there are reliability and\/or credibility concerns with both Mr. Leon and Mr. Ferri. The probative value of Ms. Chambers\u2019 evidence was impaired as a result of communications and material being provided to her by Mr. Ferri about this case.\n[27] I need emphasize that I place little to no reliance on the CRA\u2019s Report on Objection in evidence as it clearly contains significant overstatements about what Mr. Ferri wrote to CRA and an even greater overstatement about the results of the Canada Border Service Agency\u2019s test for dating the ink used to sign Mr. Ferri\u2019s Form 1. These were completely unacceptable, and, unsurprisingly, led to a waste of public resources in this proceeding and hearing. Mr. Ferri, like any other Canadian, was entirely reasonable in responding very fully to an unsubstantiated allegation and untruth about CBSA\u2019s initial suspicions, which is the highest they could be described as. CRA did not act on that suspicion and pursue it with any expert analysis, but wrote accusing Mr. Ferri of essentially forging or evidence tempering. What the CRA Officer wrote was not at all what the CBSA reported to it, nor was it what CBSA was asked to do. This must be most strongly discouraged, especially at the objection stage as a taxpayer\u2019s sole remedy after that is to formally appeal to this Court.\n[28] That is not what CBSA reported CRA. If anything, the fact that CRA chose not to actually have the ink dated indicates CRA did not make any relevant assumption regarding when the Form I was signed and I make no finding in that regard as that would have required an expert report from the respondent. I can note that there is absolutely no evidence of any probative value that the Form 1 was in fact signed on any other date. That Report and the respondent\u2019s reliance on it in this proceeding is the sole reason I am not awarding costs at Tariff level.\n[29] The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 28th day of February 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 25\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2017-2569(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nANDREW FERRI AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nPLACE OF HEARING:\nToronto, Ontario\nDATE OF HEARING:\nMarch 14, 15 and 16, 2023\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Patrick Boyle\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\nFebruary 28, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nJeff Warwick\nCounsel for the Respondent:\nKhalid Tariq\nCOUNSEL OF RECORD:\nFor the Appellant:\nName:\nJeff Warwick\nFirm:\nFor the Respondent:\nShalene Curtis-Micallef Deputy Attorney General of Canada Ottawa, Canada\n",

INTRODUCTION\n[1] These Reasons pertain to the Appeals brought by Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. (\u201cSkylight\u201d), Suresh Kumar Aravindakshan (\u201cSuresh\u201d) and Titus George (\u201cTitus\u201d) in respect of assessments issued to them, under the Employment Insurance Act (the \u201cEIA\u201d)[1] and the Canada Pension Plan (the \u201cCPP\u201d)[2], by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d), as represented by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d). The fundamental question in respect of these Appeals is whether Suresh, Titus and other workers were engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment. In particular, in the case of Skylight\u2019s Appeal, two specific issues are whether Selvy Thomas (\u201cSelvy\u201d) was engaged in pensionable employment and whether Sheela Thomas (\u201cSheela\u201d) was engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment.\n[2] As is apparent, Selvy and Sheela have the same surname; however, they are not related. To avoid confusion, I will refer to them by their given names. To be consistent, I will also refer to the two individual Appellants and the other workers by their given names.\n[3] On July 9, 2018, the Minister issued Notices of Assessment for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017 (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d) to assess premiums under the EIA and contributions under the CPP. Those assessments (the \u201cAssessments\u201d) were based on the assumptions that Sheela, Suresh, Titus and Akhill Jolly (\u201cAkhill\u201d) were employed by Skylight in insurable employment, and that Selvy, Sheela, Suresh, Titus and Akhill were employed by Skylight in pensionable employment. After considering objections in respect of the Assessments, on November 7, 2018 the Minister confirmed the Assessments.\nII. FACTS\n[4] Skylight was incorporated in 2004. Initially, Selvy was the sole shareholder of Skylight. Sometime thereafter, Sheela became a 50% shareholder of Skylight, and Selvy continued to own the other 50% of the issued shares of Skylight.\nA. Particulars Concerning Selvy\n[5] During the Relevant Period, Selvy was an executive, a director and a shareholder of Skylight. She stated that she \u201cstarted Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. in the year 2004.\u201d[3]\n[6] Initially, Selvy was the sole shareholder of Skylight. Sometime after October 31, 2017, Selvy\u2019s equity interest in Skylight was reduced to 50%.[4]\nB. Particulars Concerning Sheela\n[7] At some point in time, after October 31, 2017, Selvy arranged for Sheela to become a 50% shareholder of Skylight. Selvy said that Sheela was her partner and that Sheela \u201cwork[ed] selling packages.\u201d[5]\nC. Particulars Concerning Akhill and Giya\n[8] While testifying, Selvy explained that, during the Relevant Period, Skylight had four employees, i.e., herself, Sheela, Akhill and Giya Joy (\u201cGiya\u201d). Selvy stated that Akhill and Giya had been engaged as employees and were treated as such. Akhill and Giya each received a salary, were issued T4 slips after each taxation year, had a work station at Skylight\u2019s premises, had fixed office hours, and were supervised as employees. Selvy stated that the circumstances in respect of the employment of Akhill and Giya were substantially different from the circumstances in respect of the arrangements that Skylight had with Suresh and Titus.\n[9] Although Skylight seemed to treat Akhill as an employee, the Minister approached the audit of Skylight on the premise that Skylight had viewed Akhill as an independent contractor.[6]\nD. Particulars Concerning Suresh\n[10] During his direct examination, Suresh stated that he came to Canada from India in 2015. However, during cross-examination he indicated that he came to Canada in 2010, and then worked for three years as a shift manager at a fast food restaurant in Toronto, before enrolling in a travel and tourism course at Everest College. After completing that course, Suresh learned of a vacancy at Skylight and applied. During his initial interview, he was asked by Selvy whether he would like to work as a contractor or as an employee. He chose to work as a contractor, on a commission basis.\n[11] A primary aspect of Suresh\u2019s work was to assemble tour packages. Drawing on his prior experience working as a hotel operations manager in India and as a worker in food services positions in Saudi Arabia, Suresh prepared tour packages for South Asia. The packages were all-inclusive, in the sense that they included flights, hotels, ground transportation (or transfers) and excursions. He worked with two suppliers, which he identified as Tamarind Services International (which made the specific arrangements with the various hotels and transportation companies in South Asia)[7] and Tours East (which provided airline tickets). Sometimes, using SABRE, Suresh arranged the airline transportation for his clients.[8]\n[12] Suresh stated that he primarily worked at home, where he had a home office or work space. The furniture in his home office included a desk, which he had purchased himself, a chair, a laptop computer and his cell phone. He attended at Skylight\u2019s place of business occasionally, generally on a monthly basis, to drop off a list setting out the tour packages and other travel arrangements that he had made and the commissions earned in respect thereof. Suresh stated that he did not have any assistance from Skylight in compiling the tour packages. He typically dropped off his sales reports, which were entitled \u201cAgent Commission Forms\u201d and which were sometimes referred to as invoices.\n[13] The commissions earned by Suresh in respect of his sales were split with Skylight. Suresh was entitled to 70% of each commission, and Skylight was entitled to 30% of each commission. This had been discussed and negotiated during Suresh\u2019s initial meeting with Selvy, and was referenced in the confirmation letter signed by Selvy and Suresh on April 5, 2015.[9]\n[14] Suresh found his clients primarily through social media, friends and connections within his community in Toronto. His social media advertising was generally done by posts (which he called fliers) on Facebook.\n[15] Suresh stated that he obtained no support from Skylight in assembling tour packages, other than access to SABRE and the use of Skylight\u2019s name, which he acknowledges had some value.\n[16] Suresh was not aware of Skylight\u2019s office hours, as he worked primarily at home and set his own hours, and was his own boss.\n[17] He stated that Selvy did not question the amount of his production or suggest that he should increase his production, nor did she review his work.\n[18] Suresh could take days off whenever he wished. He did not need to obtain permission from Selvy or anyone else at Skylight to take a vacation. However, if he was going to be away for more than a few days, as a courtesy, he advised Skylight that he would be on vacation. Skylight did not provide vacation pay to him.\n[19] Skylight made business cards available to its workers. However, Suresh stated that he made his own business cards, which he apparently preferred to use. He paid for the printing of his own business cards. His business cards showed both Skylight\u2019s name and his name, as well as the telephone numbers and fax number of Skylight and his own cell phone number. The business cards also showed his Skylight email address and the domain name of Skylight\u2019s website.\n[20] Suresh stated that he could not be reached by calling Skylight\u2019s office telephone number. If someone called that number, asking for him, whoever answered the phone at Skylight\u2019s office generally gave the caller Suresh\u2019s cell phone number.\n[21] Suresh purchased a cell phone in 2013. During the Relevant Period, he owned it and paid the monthly phone bills.\n[22] Although his business cards showed Skylight\u2019s fax number, his clients never sent faxes to him. They always communicated with him by email or by calling him on his cell phone. They did not try to reach him by calling the telephone number of Skylight\u2019s office.\nE. Particulars Concerning Titus\n[23] Decades ago, Titus, who was 69 years of age when the trial commenced, had been a travel agent in Dubai. In 1996, he came to Canada for a brief period of time, then went abroad for almost five years, and subsequently returned to Canada sometime in 2000. For approximately 15 years he worked in non\u2011travel\u2011related endeavours. Desiring to return to the travel field, in 2015 Titus approached Skylight, seeking a part-time position. He selected Skylight because it focused on travel to South India, which was his preferred area of work.\n[24] According to Selvy and Titus, at their initial meeting, on January 11, 2015, Selvy arranged for a brief letter to be printed on Skylight letterhead, after which they both signed the letter. As the letter is quite brief, the substantive portion thereof is quoted below:\nWe would like to confirm that you (Mr. Titus George) are presently working with Skylight Travel & Tours Inc as a contractor in the department of Travel and Tourism. You are employed as travel agent based on commissions to be paid as agreed at the time of acceptance. Please note that you will be responsible for filing your own income taxes and paying all the applicable government taxes at the end of the year with your accountant directly.[10]\n[25] Selvy testified that she understood that Titus had been engaged by Skylight to work as an independent contractor. It was not expressly clear from Titus\u2019 testimony as to what was his precise intention in respect of his status. It seems that he was more concerned about ensuring that he would be engaged on a part\u2011time, rather than a full\u2011time, basis.\n[26] Although Titus had worked extensively in Dubai as a travel agent, that was a number of years previous to his being engaged by Skylight. In Dubai, he had not used the SABRE airline reservation system. Accordingly, he needed training in respect of SABRE and other aspects of the Canadian travel industry. That training took about one week, in respect of which he did not receive any remuneration or other payment from Skylight.\n[27] All travel agents in Ontario are required to be licensed with the Travel Industry Council of Ontario (\u201cTICO\u201d). Titus wrote the TICO exam and paid, out of his own pocket, the $200 examination fee. Skylight did not reimburse him for that amount.\n[28] Titus did not book tours. His work consisted of making airline reservations for clients, for which he earned commissions.\n[29] Skylight did not control Titus\u2019 work hours. Titus only advised Skylight, and did not seek permission, before going on vacation. The amount of his production was never questioned.[11] Skylight did not provide Titus with office supplies, other than business cards.[12]\nF. Billing and Compensation Arrangements for Suresh and Titus\n[30] Neither Suresh nor Titus was paid a salary or wages by Skylight. As noted above, the only earnings received by Suresh and Titus were 70% of the commissions received by Skylight in respect of their sales. Given the nature of the airline, hotel and other travel\u2011related industries, and the manner in which travelling customers purchase tickets, accommodation and other tour\u2011related amenities, the commissions pertaining to the work done by Suresh and Titus were paid to Skylight. On a periodic basis, Suresh and Titus each provided Skylight with tabulations showing the tickets, tours or other packages that had been purchased by their respective clients and the amount of commission paid to Skylight on behalf of Suresh or Titus, as the case may have been. Upon receiving those statements and upon confirming that the commissions had been received by Skylight, Skylight then periodically issued cheques to Suresh and Titus, so as to pay their respective 70% portions of those commissions.\nIII. ISSUES\n[31] The issues in respect of these Appeals are the following:\na)During the Relevant Period, was Selvy engaged in pensionable employment?\nb)During the Relevant Period, was Sheela engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nc)During the Relevant Period, was Akhill engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nd)During the Relevant Period, was Suresh engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\ne)During the Relevant Period, was Titus engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment?\nIV. EVIDENTIARY CONCERNS\nA. Letter Agreements\n[32] Early in the trial, a voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of a letter agreement dated April 5, 2015 between Skylight and Suresh,[13] and, eventually, a somewhat similar letter agreement dated January 11, 2015 between Skylight and Titus (most of which is quoted above).[14] Counsel for the Minister objected to the introduction of those two letter agreements, on the ground that the Notice of Appeal stated that there was only a verbal agreement.[15] It seems that counsel for the Minister was also concerned that the letter agreements were late\u2011produced, self\u2011serving documents. A copy of Suresh\u2019s letter agreement was provided to counsel for the Minister only a week before the trial began, and a copy of Titus\u2019 letter agreement was not made known to his own counsel, let alone counsel for the Minister, until partway through the voir dire.\n[33] A further concern related to the letterhead on which the two letter agreements were printed, as the two letter agreements showed different addresses for Skylight. By way of background, Selvy explained that, from the time of its incorporation, in 2004, until sometime before 2015, Skylight\u2019s address had been located at 3428 Sheppard Avenue East, Scarborough, Ontario. In 2015, Skylight\u2019s address was located at 3300 McNicoll Avenue, Scarborough.[16] Sometime thereafter, Skylight moved its office to 3341 Markham Road, Toronto. Titus testified that, when he met with Selvy in January 2015 for his initial application interview, Skylight\u2019s office was located at 3300 McNicoll Avenue. However, the address shown on Titus\u2019 letter agreement, which was dated January 11, 2015, was 3341 Markham Road. The address shown on Suresh\u2019s letter agreement, which was dated April 5, 2015, was 3428 Sheppard Avenue East.\n[34] Selvy explained the above discrepancies by indicating that, when Skylight moved its office from Sheppard Avenue to McNicoll Avenue, Skylight had a large supply of unused letterhead showing the Sheppard Avenue address. Skylight continued to use that letterhead until it was exhausted. It was for that reason that the letter agreement between Skylight and Suresh showed the Sheppard Avenue address. Selvy also explained that, in 2017 or thereabouts, Titus needed to send a copy of his letter agreement to TICO, but could not find his copy of it. The text of the letter agreement was still stored in Skylight\u2019s computer; therefore, Selvy arranged for the letter agreement to be reprinted on Skylight\u2019s letterhead, which, at that time, showed the new address on Markham Road.\n[35] Selvy, Suresh and Titus each testified that she or he (as the case may have been) had signed the applicable letter agreement. In my view, there is no question as to the authenticity or genuineness of the two letter agreements, although there may be a question as to whether they were backdated. Accordingly, at the conclusion of the voir dire, I admitted the two letter agreements into evidence, but indicated that I would determine the weight, if any, to be given to them.\n[36] In making the above decision (to admit the letter agreements into evidence), I accepted Selvy\u2019s explanation. It is not uncommon for a business to use up outdated letterhead before switching to new letterhead that contains up-to-date information. Both Selvy and Titus (who was not present in the courtroom when Selvy testified) confirmed that the letter agreement of January 11, 2015 had been reprinted in 2017 or thereabouts, as a copy of it was required by TICO. A further point to note is that, if Selvy, Suresh and Titus had desired to fabricate the letter agreements on the eve of the trial of these Appeals, it is likely that both letter agreements would have been printed on the same letterhead. The fact that the two letter agreements were printed on different letterhead tends to confirm that they were not fabricated on the eve of trial.\n[37] As indicated above, the Minister and the CRA are concerned that they had apparently been told by Selvy, Suresh or Titus that the only agreements between Skylight and Suresh and between Skylight and Titus were verbal agreements, and not written agreements. In reviewing the EI Notice of Appeal and the CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Skylight, I note that paragraph 6 of each of those pleadings stated, \u201cThe verbal agreement with Skylight and these individuals \u2026 envisaged the following\u201d, and there then followed a list of nine terms describing the arrangements between Skylight and Suresh and between Skylight and Titus. I did not find any provision in either of those Notices of Appeal that said that there was only a verbal agreement, and not a written agreement, as well. In reviewing the EI Notice of Appeal and the CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Suresh and the EI Notice of Appeal and CPP Notice of Appeal filed by Titus, I did not find any specific reference to a verbal agreement or a written agreement per se. As is clear from reviewing the two letter agreements, the substantive portions of those two agreements are extremely brief. I do not find it unusual or inconsistent that each letter agreement would be supplemented by a verbal agreement setting out additional terms of the arrangement between Skylight and Suresh and the arrangement between Skylight and Titus. Furthermore, I did not find any statement, in the pleadings or otherwise, where Skylight, Suresh or Titus stated that there was only a verbal agreement and no written agreement.\n[38] After the trial, as I reviewed the various reports prepared by two CRA officers (whose reports will be discussed below), I noted that they had acknowledged that the intention of Skylight, Suresh and Titus was that those two individuals would work for Skylight as independent contractors, and not as employees.[17] Accordingly, I have determined that sufficient weight may be put on the letter agreements to confirm the intention of the parties thereto and the general nature of their respective relationships.\n[39] Although there was the occasional memory lapse,[18] I found Selvy, Suresh and Titus to be credible and generally reliable witnesses. Having considered their testimony and having reviewed the letter agreements and the circumstances of their formation, I have concluded that I may rely on each letter agreement as indicating an intention on the part of the parties thereto to create an independent\u2011contractor relationship, and not an employment relationship.\nB. Auditor\u2019s Reports and Testimony\n[40] Counsel for the Minister called two witnesses from the CRA. The first CRA witness, to whom I will refer as the \u201cRulings Officer\u201d, is currently an acting CPP\/EI Appeals Officer. She worked as a CPP\/EI Rulings Officer from 2013 to 2021. The second CRA witness, to whom I will refer as the \u201cAppeals Officer\u201d, began to work for the CRA in 2008. In 2014 she became a CPP\/EI Appeals Officer, and in 2018 she became a Resource Officer in CPP\/EI Appeals. She is currently a Program Advisor in Developing Program and Learning for the CPP\/EI Appeals Division.\n[41] The Rulings Officer wrote a Ruling Report in respect of Suresh[19] and another Ruling Report in respect of Titus.[20] The contents of the two Reports were almost identical. During her testimony, the Rulings Officer acknowledged that she had done a lot of cutting and pasting.[21]\n[42] Each of the two Ruling Reports is a composite document, beginning with details and particulars concerning Suresh (in the case of Exhibit R\u20112) and Titus (in the case of Exhibit R\u20113). There then follows a larger portion entitled \u201cFacts\u201d which is approximately six pages long, and which, among other things, purports to summarize separate telephone conversations that the Rulings Officer had on June 7, 2017 with Suresh and Titus respectively, as well as with Selvy. The next portion of each Ruling Report is entitled \u201cEmployment Status\u201d; it analyzed the facts that the Rulings Officer had purportedly obtained from Suresh and Titus respectively, as well as from Selvy. Each Ruling Report came to the conclusion that the particular worker (i.e., Suresh or Titus) was engaged in insurable employment and pensionable employment. The final portion of each Ruling Report is entitled \u201cDecision\u201d. It seems to indicate that the status of the respective working arrangements in respect of Suresh and Titus was changed from \u201cContract for Service\u201d [sic] to \u201cContract of Service\u201d.\n[43] As noted above, the Rulings Officer acknowledged that she had done a lot of cutting and pasting in preparing her Reports. The analysis portions of the two Reports (i.e., the portions entitled \u201cEmployment Status\u201d) were identical. More troubling is the similarity between the summary of the two telephone conversations that the Rulings Officer had with Suresh and Titus respectively on June 7, 2017. Large portions of the summaries of those two conversations are identical. There are a few differences, such as an indication in the summary of the conversation with Titus, where he indicated that he was \u201cpaid strictly commission\u201d,[22] whereas there was no such statement in the summary of the conversation with Suresh. The summary of the conversation with Suresh states, \u201cHe confirmed all paperwork bears the name of Skylight.\u201d[23] There is no such statement in the summary of the conversation with Titus. Apart from these and a few other minor variations, the wording of the two summaries is essentially identical, subject to a few obvious efforts to make the two documents look different, such as referring to Suresh as a \u201cTicketing Agent\u201d and to Titus as a \u201cTravel Agent\u201d, or using the word \u201cstated\u201d in one summary and the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d in the corresponding place in the other summary, or using the word \u201cquotas\u201d in Titus\u2019 summary and the phrase \u201csales targets\u201d in Suresh\u2019s summary. Another example of this, which will be discussed below, is the use of \u201cHe laughed\u2026\u201d in Suresh\u2019s summary and \u201cHe chuckled\u2026\u201d in Titus\u2019 summary.\n[44] The extremely close similarity between the two Ruling Reports was explored during the examination in chief of the Rulings Officer in these terms:\nMS. ELLEITHY: \u2026 I did notice that \u2026 a lot of the wording is very similar. So, for example, \u2026 if we compare the ruling report at Tab 7 [Exhibit R\u20112] and Tab 8 [Exhibit R\u20113], there\u2019s a lot of similarities to the way it\u2019s structured, the order it\u2019s written and the wording. Could you explain why that is?\n[RULINGS OFFICER]: Yes, it is -- a lot of it is cut and paste because it\u2019s the same for each file. Like, again, when I reached out to the owner, that information would be a direct cut and paste into -- because I called at the same time. Again, if I left a message for -- to call me back regarding, you know, each worker, I certainly would change the name. But honestly, with this particular position, there\u2019s only -- and doing so many files, there\u2019s only so many ways you can write, you know, \u201cTools and equipment were not provided by the worker.\u201d\nSo, again, a lot of it has the same flow because that\u2019s just my writing style and addressing, you know, tools and equipment, and then subcontracting, and then getting into expenses. But again, it\u2019s personalized, too, because if something has been -- you know, to go back to the previous ruling report [i.e., Exhibit R\u20112], in respect of Suresh where I\u2019ve noted that they chuckled to a question, you know, that\u2019s specific to that individual.\nSo, that\u2019s why a lot of it appears to be the same because it is the same. A lot of it, the answers are the same, but I like to, again, make it specific to that worker as well that, you know, a conversation has taken place with this individual, because not everybody is going to chuckle to the same question or add their own comments.\nWe can\u2019t put, as I mentioned before, our personal opinions in the file, so that\u2019s sort of what we do, and in this case, I have done, is information that was substantially similar I\u2019ve put it in, and then tweaked it based on the specifics of that worker.[24] [Emphasis added.]\n[45] As indicated in the italicized portions of the above exchange between counsel for the Minister and the Rulings Officer, which took place during the discussion of the Ruling Report in respect of Titus (i.e., Exhibit R\u20113), the Rulings Officer made reference to her comment about \u201cthe previous ruling report\u201d (i.e., Exhibit R\u20112, being the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh), where she noted that the interviewee had chuckled to a question and pointed out that that was specific to that individual. That comment about \u201cthe previous ruling report\u201d occurred earlier in her testimony, when she was discussing the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh, and when she was asked by counsel for the Minister why she had included the \u201cHe laughed\u2026\u201d comment in her Report. The Rulings Officer replied:\nMS. ELLEITHY: And I wanted to ask, why would you -- why is that something to notate?\n[RULINGS OFFICER]: Well, it\u2019s an interesting reaction to the question, I think, and it speaks to -- like, it almost is -- you know, with somebody laughing and thinking the question is a joke, when it is a serious question, but to have that sort of reaction. And in the file, you know, I always like to add something that\u2019s sort of -- you know, because you can only write certain paragraphs, the information, the same way, so to add a little sort of personalized comment or reaction to the question.\nBut that particular question -- that\u2019s what I remember about this file.[25] [Emphasis added.]\n[46] When discussing Suresh and Exhibit R\u20112 (shortly before the above\u2011quoted exchange), the Rulings Officer had said that she remembered \u201cthe one gentleman chuckling about not going on vacation,\u201d but she could not remember whether the gentleman was Suresh or Titus.[26] The Rulings Officer may have been referring to the following comment that she wrote in the Ruling Report in respect of Suresh (as set out in Exhibit R\u20112):\nHe laughed when asked if he\u2019s received any personal invitations to experience resorts and stated that Selvy Thomas has as the owner of the travel agency.[27]\nOr she may have been referring to a comment that she wrote in the Ruling Report in respect of Titus (Exhibit R\u20113), which is quoted in the next paragraph.\n[47] Although I had initially understood that the Rulings Officer\u2019s reference to the chuckling was intended to show that she had remembered the distinct conversation and that her summary of that conversation was personalized to particularize that specific conversation,[28] I now question whether that was really the case, in light of the following statement from the summary of her conversation with Titus (i.e., Exhibit R\u20113):\nHe chuckled and stated he has not received any personal invitations to experience resorts and stated that Selvy Thomas has as the owner of the travel agency.[29]\n[48] During cross\u2011examination, counsel for the Appellants noted that significant portions of the Rulings Officer\u2019s summaries of her telephone conversations with Suresh and Titus appeared to be \u201cword for word\u201d the same and that they \u201clooked like a cut and paste.\u201d[30] Then, when counsel for the Appellants suggested to the Rulings Officer that she had not tweaked the two summaries (as she had claimed),[31] she replied:\nThere are parts that are specific to each of the individuals. But after doing this job so many times, it gets a little - - it\u2019s not a creative writing assignment.[32]\n[49] I am deeply concerned by the manner in which the Ruling Reports were prepared. With respect to the Rulings Officer\u2019s summaries of her telephone conversations with Suresh and Titus, I am left with the impression that she had anticipated in advance the answers that she was seeking and that she had already developed the language needed to record those answers. With respect to the analytical portions of the Ruling Reports, the precisely identical wording of the analyses of the respective working arrangements pertaining to Suresh and Titus raises the question of whether one analysis was copied from the other, or whether both were copied from the same precedent.\n[50] Given the manner in which the Ruling Reports were prepared, I have concerns as to whether the Rulings Officer addressed the situations of Suresh and Titus separately, or whether she took a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to her audit. Consequently, where her Reports differ from the testimony of the Appellants, I am inclined to rely on that testimony, rather than the Reports.\n[51] To the extent that the Ruling Reports set out statements made to the Rulings Officer by Selvy, Suresh or Titus, a question arose during the trial as to whether those Reports contained hearsay evidence. Initially, counsel for the Minister had advised the Court that she desired to adduce the Reports for the truth of their contents. However, after the hearsay concern had been raised, counsel for the Minister stated that she was relying on the Reports only to challenge the credibility of the workers, i.e., to show that the particular statements had been made, and not that they were necessarily true. Based on the manner in which the Ruling Reports were drafted, I am not persuaded that those Reports correctly recorded the statements that had been made.\n[52] I do not consider that the Ruling Reports have impeached the credibility of Selvy, Suresh or Titus. Rather, given the \u201ccut and paste\u201d nature of the Reports, I question whether the Reports have accurately reproduced the statements that may have been made by Selvy, Suresh and Titus to the Rulings Officer.\n[53] A possible explanation for the similarity between the Ruling Reports in respect of Suresh (Exhibit R\u20112) and Titus (Exhibit R\u20113) might relate to a communication barrier between the Rulings Officer on the one hand and Suresh and Titus respectively on the other hand. Intending no disrespect, I found that, during their oral testimonies, it was difficult to understand Suresh from time to time, and even more difficult to understand Titus. In addition, there were various instances during Titus\u2019 testimony where it seemed that he had a general understanding of the questions that were put to him, but he did not understand those questions precisely. The communication difficulties that I observed during the hearing may well have been exacerbated over the telephone, which is the way in which the Rulings Officer interviewed Suresh and Titus.\n[54] Regardless of whether there was a communication barrier or not, there were several instances (such as the question of whether Suresh and Titus worked at home or in Skylight\u2019s office) where the statements written by the Rulings Officer in her Ruling Reports were diametrically opposed to the statements given by Suresh and Titus on the witness stand. As already mentioned, I found Suresh and Titus, as well as Selvy, to be credible and generally reliable. Accordingly, as indicated above, I prefer their evidence over the Ruling Reports prepared by the Rulings Officer.\n[55] Turning to the Appeals Officer, she had originally anticipated that she would testify on October 20, 2021; however, as the trial progressed more slowly than expected, she did not begin to testify until April 26, 2022. She stated that, in preparation for her anticipated testimony on October 20, 2021, she had, in October 2021, reviewed her Memo For File (Form T2020)[33] and her Report On An Appeal (Form CPT110).[34] However, she acknowledged that she had not reviewed the Memo and Report during the period between October 20, 2021 and the commencement of her testimony on April 26, 2022. She also acknowledged that she could not remember the specific conversations that she had had with Suresh and Titus. Accordingly, I have reservations about the reliability of her memory and her testimony.\n[56] I wish to make a comment about the terminology used by the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer (together, the \u201cOfficers\u201d) in their respective Reports. Rather than using the terms employment contract and independent contract, the Officers generally used the traditional historical terms contract of service and contract for services. While either set of terms is acceptable, when referring to a contract for services, the Officers often used the term contract of services. I found this terminology to be confusing, as it was not always clear whether they were referring to a contract of service and inadvertently put an s at the end of service, or whether they were referring to a contract for services and inadvertently substituted the word of for the word for. An example of this confusion is the following excerpt from one of the Appeals Officer\u2019s reports:\nIt is recommended that the parties involved in this appeal be advised, by Ministerial Notification, that after a complete and impartial review of information, the workers, Selvy Thomas, Sureh [sic] Aravindaksha [sic], George Titus [sic], Akhill Jolly and Sheela Thomas were engaged by the payer, Skylight Travel & Tours Inc., under a contract of service during their respected [sic] periods under review. The requirements of contract of services were met; therefore, employer\u2011employee relationships existed.[35] [Emphasis added.]\nV. ANALYSIS\nA. Selvy\u2019s Status\n[57] In Skylight\u2019s Notices of Appeal, Skylight pleaded that Selvy and Sheela each owned 50% of the common shares of Skylight, and that it was incorrect for one of the CRA auditors to state that Selvy owned 100% of the common shares of Skylight. However, during her testimony, Selvy clarified that she had owned 100% of the common shares of Skylight upon its incorporation and during the Relevant Period,[36] and that, sometime after the Relevant Period, Sheela acquired 50% of the issued common shares of Skylight.\n[58] As Selvy has always owned more than 40% of the common shares (which are presumed to be the only voting shares) of Skylight, her employment with Skylight was not insurable.[37]\n[59] In the course of the trial, Selvy acknowledged that, during the Relevant Period, she had been employed by Skylight in pensionable employment.[38]\nB. Sheela\u2019s Status\n[60] In its EI Notice of Appeal, Skylight took the position that Sheela and Selvy each owned 50% of its voting shares, such that, by reason of paragraph 5(2)(b) of the EIA, Sheela was not engaged in insurable employment.[39] As indicated above, during her testimony, Selvy stated that she and Sheela are currently equal voting shareholders of Skylight. However, during the Relevant Period, Selvy owned all of the voting shares of Skylight. Accordingly, while it appears that Sheela\u2019s current employment with Skylight is not insurable employment, her employment with Skylight during the Relevant Period was insurable employment.\n[61] In the course of the trial, Skylight conceded that, during the Relevant Period, Sheela had been employed by Skylight in insurable employment and pensionable employment.[40]\nC. Akhill\u2019s Status\n[62] Skylight\u2019s Notices of Appeal focus primarly on the particulars of Suresh and Titus, with a minor reference to Selvy and Sheela, and no reference to Akhill. In the course of the trial, it was acknowledged by Skylight that, during the Relevant Period, Akhill had been employed by Skylight in insurable employment and pensionable employment.[41]\nD. Legal Principles Applicable to Suresh and Titus\n[63] Based on the pleadings, it is the position of Skylight, Suresh and Titus that, during the Relevant Period, Skylight had engaged each of Suresh and Titus pursuant to an independent contract (sometimes called a contract for services), and not pursuant to a contract of employment (sometimes called a contract of service). On the other hand, the Minister takes the opposite position. To resolve this matter, it is necessary to apply the two-step analytical process described by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes.[42]\n[64] In Connor Homes, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that, in determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, it is necessary to consider the intention of the worker and the person who hired the worker, as well as considering the traditional factors enunciated in Sagaz Industries and Wiebe Door.[43] Those factors are:\n(a) Does the hirer control the worker\u2019s activities?\n(b) Does the hirer provide the tools and equipment required by the worker, or is the worker required to provide his or her own tools and equipment?\n(c) Does the worker hire his or her own helpers?\n(d) What is the degree of financial risk taken by the worker? In other words, does the worker have a risk of loss?\n(e) What is the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker?\n(f) Does the worker have an opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks?[44]\n[65] Over the past couple of decades, some courts have noted that, rather than there being a sharp dichotomy between an employment contract and an independent contract, there is a continuum, with the employer\u2011employee relationship at one end, the independent\u2011contractor relationship at the other end, and a hybrid, intermediate or dependent\u2011contractor relationship somewhere in the middle.[45] It is generally recognized that a hybrid, intermediate or dependent\u2011contractor relationship is akin to, but not the same as, an employer\u2011employee relationship.[46] In determining whether a worker is an employee or a dependent contractor, courts have typically applied the same principles that are used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.[47]\n[66] As the principles used to distinguish a dependent contractor from an employee are similar to those used to distinguish an independent contractor from an employee, in these Reasons, I will sometimes simply use the term contractor, rather than independent contractor or dependent contractor.\nE. Suresh\u2019s Status\n[67] Following the guidance provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes, I will first consider whether there was a mutual understanding or common intention between Skylight and Suresh regarding their relationship. I will then consider the factors identified in Sagaz and Wiebe Door in light of such mutual intent (if any) for the purpose of determining if, on balance, the relevant facts sustain and are consistent with such intent, or, if there was not a mutual intent, determining whether those factors point to employment or independent contract.\n(1) Intention [68] At the commencement of Suresh\u2019s relationship with Skylight, Selvy and Suresh signed a letter agreement, dated April 5, 2015, on Skylight letterhead. As the letter agreement was relatively brief, containing only one paragraph, I have quoted that paragraph below:\nWe would like to confirm that you (Suresh Aravindakshan) is [sic] presently working with Skylight Travel & Tours Inc as a contractor in the department of Travel and Tourism. Mr. Aravindakshan is earning 70 % agent\u2019s commissions as agreed at the time of acceptance. Please note that you will be responsible for filing your own income taxes and paying all the applicable government taxes at the end of the year with your accountant directly.[48]\n[69] Based on the above letter, as well as the testimony of Selvy and Suresh, it is my understanding that they both understood and intended that Suresh would work for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. As well, it appears that the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer also acknowledged that Selvy (on behalf of Skylight) and Suresh intended that Suresh would work as an independent contractor.[49]\n(2) Control [70] Concerning the question of whether Skylight had control over Suresh in respect of the work which he undertook for Skylight, Selvy testified that Skylight did not expect Suresh to work a certain number of hours each week or to produce a certain volume of sales.[50]\n[71] Suresh could take sick days or vacation whenever he wanted.[51] In his testimony, Suresh confirmed that he set his own work hours and that he could take time off whenever he wanted,[52] although he did advise Skylight when he was going on vacation and indicated the days that he would not be available for work.[53]\n[72] When Suresh made a sale to a client, he generally did not report the sale to Selvy.[54] However, Suresh did advise Selvy of clients coming to Skylight\u2019s office to pay for a tour package,[55] so that Skylight could promptly wire the money to the particular tour operator.[56]\n[73] Suresh prepared his own invoices in respect of the commissions that he earned in respect of the sales that he made. He took the invoices to Skylight\u2019s office every two weeks.[57]\n[74] Skylight regularly issued cheques to Suresh to pay 70% of his earned commissions to him, while Skylight retained the other 30%.[58]\n[75] Skylight did not conduct performance reviews in respect of Suresh, or set sales targets for him.[59]\n[76] Suresh\u2019s title at Skylight was Travel Tour Coordinator. This was a title that he selected himself. Skylight had no issue with that title.[60]\n[77] Based on my understanding of the evidence, Skylight did not control Suresh\u2019s activities. This factor points strongly toward independent\u2011contractor status.\n(3) Tools and Equipment [78] Suresh worked primarily from home, where he had established a home office or other work space. He paid for the office furniture, including a desk and chair, himself. He provided his own laptop computer and his own cell phone.[61] The office maintained by Skylight was quite small (approximately 450 to 550 square feet in size) and was regularly used by Selvy, Sheela, Akhill and Giya. There was little physical room for Suresh to work in Skylight\u2019s office, and he did not have a desk or work space in that office.[62] Suresh used his personal cell phone to conduct business, and he paid the cell phone bills himself.[63] Suresh provided all of his own office supplies and office equipment.[64]\n[79] Skylight provided Suresh with password access to Skylight\u2019s license to use SABRE, as well as with business cards showing Skylight\u2019s general phone number, toll\u2011free number and fax number.[65] Suresh stated that he obtained from Skylight the template for its business cards, and he printed his own cards at his own expense.[66] Suresh\u2019s clients generally called him on his cell phone, and rarely used Skylight\u2019s office phone when trying to reach him; they did not send faxes to him.[67] Skylight also provided Suresh with an email address and the use of Skylight\u2019s email system.[68]\n[80] Suresh did not pay a specific fee to Skylight for the use of SABRE, the use of the business card template or the use of Skylight\u2019s email system. Selvy and Suresh explained that a portion of Skylight\u2019s 30% share of Suresh\u2019s commissions was intended to cover those costs.[69]\n[81] This factor points in both directions.\n(4) Hiring of Helpers [82] Selvy stated, on behalf of Skylight, that Suresh could engage a third party as a subcontractor and that he could hire helpers to assist with his work.[70] Suresh stated that he did not have any occasion to engage a subcontractor or to hire a helper or assistant. It is unclear, from his testimony, whether Suresh understood that he did, or did not, have the authority to hire a helper.[71] While Selvy\u2019s evidence points toward an independent contract, rather than employment, given that Suresh did not hire any subcontractors or other helpers, and given that he did not seem to understand fully and clearly the questions put to him in respect of this factor, I am inclined to treat this as a neutral factor.\n(5) Risk of Loss [83] Before Suresh had even begun to work for Skylight, he had incurred expenses. In 2014, Suresh took various courses in respect of travel and tourism at Everest College, at his own expense.[72] Suresh also took preparatory courses for, and passed, the requisite TICO licensing exam, again at his own expense, before he began to work for Skylight.[73]\n[84] Given that Suresh worked from home, and had to provide his own laptop, cell phone, office furniture, supplies, advertising and other work\u2011related items, he incurred work\u2011related expenses on a regular basis. If a client were to book a trip with Suresh, and then subsequently cancel the trip, Suresh would not receive a commission, although he would receive a cancellation fee.[74] As well, as he was paid by commission only, it was possible that there may have been months in which his expenses exceeded his revenue.\n[85] My sense is that Suresh had relatively modest work\u2011related expenses. Nevertheless, as there was always a possibility that those expenses would exceed his revenue, Suresh had a risk of loss. This factor points toward independent contract.\n(6) Responsibility for Investment and Management [86] There was no evidence adduced in respect of this factor. Therefore, I consider it to be a neutral or inapplicable factor.\n(7) Opportunity for Profit [87] Akhill and Giya, who were travel consultants and who were acknowledged by Skylight to be employees, were paid by salary.[75] On the other hand, Suresh was paid by commission only. Furthermore, as Suresh had his own clients, he was able to negotiate a 70%\/30% split of the commission, rather than a 60%\/40% split, which (according to Selvy) is the standard allocation in the travel industry.[76]\n[88] Suresh assembled his own tour packages, which included airfare, hotel accommodation and day tours. He prepared his own fliers to advertise the packages, which were often scheduled to coincide with \u201csome festival time\u201d or holiday.[77] He advertised his tour packages by word of mouth, social media and other promotions. The flights included in the packages were booked through Skylight\u2019s SABRE system, but all other arrangements were made by Suresh without any support from Skylight.[78] Suresh, and not Skylight, set the prices of the tours that he sold.[79]\n[89] During cross\u2011examination, Suresh described the process that he used to assemble a tour package. Suresh typically engaged the services of a vendor or supplier in India, such as Tours East or Tamarind Services International, as he found that it was preferable to have all aspects of the package (such as flights, hotels and ground transportation) arranged through a single entity. However, Suresh prepared the package himself and then gave instructions to the vendor selected for that package to make the bookings in his name (or perhaps sometimes his clients\u2019 names). The vendor charged a price to Suresh, which he paid. In subsequently billing his clients, Suresh added a markup of 5%, 10%, 15% or thereabouts, as negotiated with his clients, who sometimes bargained with him in the hope of getting a discount.[80]\n[90] With respect to flights that Suresh booked using Skylight\u2019s SABRE account, he could not change the price that was available through SABRE, but he could, and did, decide the markup that he would add to that price.[81]\n[91] Suresh testified that he had his own clients. At the time of the trial, he stated that he had been working for six or seven years, and had a list of more than 500 clients. He also stated that Skylight does not have access to his list (or folder) of clients.[82]\n[92] Selvy stated that, if Suresh were to have left Skylight, he would have been able to take his client list with him to another travel agency.[83]\n[93] Suresh stated that he built his client list through contacts in his own community, through social media and other means, and that he did not get clients from Skylight.[84] However, Selvy indicated that Skylight occasionally referred to Suresh clients who desired to book a tour.[85] When asked, during cross\u2011examination, about referrals from Skylight, Suresh indicated that it happened \u201cvery, very rarely.\u201d[86]\n[94] The above summary of Suresh\u2019s commission\u2011based compensation system, with his ability to determine and negotiate the amount by which he marked up the base prices that he obtained from his vendors and other suppliers, clearly indicate that he had an opportunity for profit. This factor points strongly toward independent contract.\n(8) Weighing, Balancing and Resolving [95] The control factor, the risk of loss factor and the opportunity for profit factor point strongly toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship between Skylight and Suresh. The tools and equipment factor points in both directions, but I think that it tilts toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship. The hiring of helpers factor and the responsibility for investment and management factor are neutral or inapplicable factors.\n[96] After having considered, weighed and balanced the above factors, I have concluded that, during the Relevant Period, Suresh worked as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. In other words, on balance, the factors considered in Sagaz and Wiebe Door are consistent with the mutual understanding that Suresh worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. Therefore, during the Relevant Period, Suresh was not engaged in either insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight.\nF. Titus\u2019 Status\n[97] Following the guidance provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Connor Homes, I will first consider whether there was a mutual understanding or common intention between Skylight and Titus regarding their relationship. I will then consider the factors identified in Sagaz and Wiebe Door in light of such mutual intent (if any) for the purpose of determining if, on balance, the relevant facts sustain and are consistent with such intent, or, if there was not a mutual intent, determining whether those factors point to employment or independent contract.\n(1) Intention [98] Based on Selvy\u2019s testimony and on the letter agreement dated January 11, 2015,[87] Skylight\u2019s intention was to engage Titus as a contractor. While Titus acknowledged signing the letter agreement, it is my impression that he did not fully understand the distinction between a contractor and an employee. In his testimony, Titus indicated that he was more concerned about ensuring that he would only be expected to work on a part-time basis and that he would be permitted to work from home, rather than being required to work from Skylight\u2019s office.[88]\n[99] Titus explained the manner in which his relationship with Skylight came together, as follows:\nMR. VANIER: Okay. And I understand you wanted to get back into the travel agency business.\nMR. GEORGE: Yeah, I -- I am interested in travel business because the reason I -- again, re-doing the -- with the part-time job. I don't want full-time job.\nMR. VANIER: Okay. Well, how did the relationship with you and Skylight, how did it begin?\nMR. GEORGE: I came to know them through one of my friends, because they are the only travel -- community travel doing business in South India travel business. They are the only one goes there.\nMR. VANIER: Okay. Did you approach them with a plan?\nMR. GEORGE: One of my friend introduced them, then I approached them. They are willing to help me with a part-time job.\nMR. VANIER: So can you tell me what was agreed to?\nMR. GEORGE: It was do my own business. They will give me the commission. That is the agreement.\nMR. VANIER: Was there much negotiation on the commission split?\nMR. GEORGE: They do 70 percent of the commission, and I am okay for that.[89]\n[100] During his testimony, Titus stated that he was not an employee of Skylight, but he then went on to say that he was only a part-time employee.[90] These statements were a bit confusing as they seemed to indicate that Titus may have been uncertain as to his status, or more likely (particularly given the language difficulties), he may not have fully understood the meanings of the terms contractor and employee.[91] Nevertheless, although there was a slight element of ambiguity, it seems that, overall, Skylight and Titus mutually understood that Titus worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee.\n[101] Furthermore, it is my understanding that the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer acknowledged that Skylight and Titus intended that Titus would work as an independent contractor.[92]\n(2) Control [102] During his testimony, Titus indicated that he was not concerned about earning a large amount of money, but he did want to work part-time in the travel industry.[93] Titus explained that he had a number of connections through his religious affiliation and that he had established a number of business connections because of the friendships that he had made in his church activities. Titus did not actively advertise. Rather, new clients came to him by word of mouth from other satisfied clients. Titus explained that he had a substantial amount of repeat business from long\u2011time clients.[94]\n[103] Selvy testified that there was no legal prohibition to keep Titus from working for somebody else. In other words, he was allowed to work for other people.[95] Titus stated that he understood that he had the ability to work for other travel agencies besides Skylight, but he was not interested in doing so.[96]\n[104] Titus performed almost all of his work at his home. He only went to the office to drop off his biweekly invoices and occasionally to meet with Skylight staff or airline representatives.[97]\n[105] Titus set his own hours, had his own customers, and worked whenever he liked.[98] Titus did not report to Skylight, other than when he submitted his invoices for the commissions that he had earned.[99]\n[106] Titus did not have fixed hours during which he was expected to work, and he could take sick days or vacation whenever he needed or wanted.[100] Titus notified Skylight when he was going on vacation for an extended period of time.[101]\n[107] Skylight permitted Titus to pick the title to be used by him while working with Skylight. He selected the title Sales Executive.[102]\n[108] Titus explained the typical manner in which his clients utilized his services. They typically telephoned him, explained that they would like to take a trip and gave him the details of the trip. They had often already ascertained the price of the flight that they would like to take. Titus proceeded to do the booking for the flight and he sent the details of the flight to a consolidator, which then issued the tickets and sent them to him by email, whereupon he forwarded the tickets to the clients. Titus explained that approximately 90% of his clients paid for their flights by credit card, and their credit card numbers were entered into the SABRE system as part of the booking process. The entire process was done without Titus having any physical contact with the clients, and without Titus interacting with Skylight, other than using the password provided by Skylight to access the SABRE system. After the booking had been made and the tickets had been issued, Titus sent an invoice to Skylight, to bill for 70% of the commission that was to be paid to Skylight by the airline.[103]\n[109] Skylight did not have any financial expectations of Titus (other than to receive 30% of the commissions earned by Titus). Skylight did not impose any financial goals, sales targets or benchmarks on Titus, nor did Skylight conduct any performance reviews in respect of Titus.[104]\n[110] The evidence indicates that Skylight did not control Titus. This factor strongly points toward independent\u2011contractor status.\n(3) Tools and Equipment [111] Skylight provided Titus with access to SABRE, business cards and an email address. Titus worked primarily from his home. Titus was required to provide his own computer, telephone, office furniture (which was located at his home) and vehicle.\n[112] Titus did not make specified payments to Skylight in respect of his use of SABRE or his email address and business cards. Rather, the compensation received by Skylight for those items came out of its 30% share of the commissions earned by Titus.[105]\n[113] Skylight did not provide Titus with office supplies.[106]\n[114] While this factor points in both directions, in my view it tilts toward contractor status.\n(4) Hiring of Helpers [115] Titus testified that he could not subcontract his work to a third party, nor could he hire anyone to help him with his work.[107]\n[116] This factor points toward employment.\n(5) Risk of Loss [117] As noted above, Titus incurred work\u2011related expenses, as he was required to provide his own laptop, cell phone, office furniture and office supplies.\n[118] Titus was also required to pay the fee for the TICO examination which he took at the commencement of his work with Skylight. He was not reimbursed by Skylight for that payment.[108]\n[119] Given that Titus was required to pay the above\u2011mentioned costs, and given that it was possible that his costs for a particular month or year might exceed his revenue for that month or year, he had a risk of loss. This factor points toward independent contract.\n(6) Responsibility for Investment and Management [120] This factor was not raised during the direct examination or the cross\u2011examination of Titus. This is an inapplicable factor.\n(7) Opportunity for Profit [121] Although Titus did not advertise through print or digital media, he worked hard to develop his clientele. He found his clients primarily through personal contact and maintaining good relationships with his relatives, friends, church congregants, and other persons with whom he had a connection. Titus regularly participated in three church congregations in Toronto and a fourth congregation in Niagara. He made friends with the people whom he met, then arranged travel for them, and they spread the news of his travel services to their acquaintances.[109] Titus generated his customer contact leads himself, and not through Skylight.[110] Titus maintained a manual client list (actually a book in which he kept track of his clients),[111] which he could have taken with him if he were to have left Skylight.[112]\n[122] Titus explained that in other contractor relationships of which he was aware, some travel agencies shared commissions with their contractors on a 50%\/50% basis or a 60%\/40% (in favour of the contractor) basis.[113] However in his situation, Titus appreciated that he was entitled to 70% of his earned commissions, while Skylight received 30%.[114] The fact that the commission\u2011sharing ratio applicable to Titus was more favourable to him than the ratio used in many other situations, and the fact that the amount of commissions earned was a function of the time and effort that he devoted to client development and other aspects of his work, indicate that he had an opportunity for profit.\n[123] This factor points strongly toward contractor status.\n(8) Weighing, Balancing and Resolving [124] To summarize, the control factor, the risk of loss factor and the opportunity for profit factor point strongly toward an independent\u2011contractor relationship between Skylight and Titus. The hiring of helpers factor points toward an employer\u2011employee relationship between Skylight and Titus. Although the tools and equipment factor points in both directions, it tilts toward contractor status. The responsibility for investment and management factor is not applicable in this situation.\n[125] Based on my review of the above factors, I have concluded that, overall, those factors support the position of Skylight and Titus, i.e., those factors are consistent with the mutual understanding that Titus worked for Skylight as an independent contractor, and not as an employee. Furthermore, even if there was a lack of clarity concerning Titus\u2019 understanding of his relationship with Skylight, on balance, the Sagaz and Wiebe Door factors point toward contractor status. Accordingly, during the Relevant Period, Titus was not engaged in either insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[126] The Appeals are allowed, the Assessments in respect of Suresh (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-443(EI) and No. 2019-441(CPP)) are vacated, the Assessments in respect of Titus (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-450(EI) and No. 2019-451(CPP)) are vacated, and the Assessments in respect of Skylight (which are the subject of Appeals No. 2019-454(EI) and No. 2019-456(CPP)) are referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that, during the Relevant Period:\n(a)neither Suresh nor Titus was engaged in insurable employment or pensionable employment with Skylight;\n(b)Selvy was engaged in pensionable employment, but not insurable employment, with Skylight; and\n(c)Sheela and Akhill were engaged in both insurable employment and pensionable employment with Skylight.\n[127] As neither the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Employment Insurance Act nor the Tax Court of Canada Rules of Procedure Respecting the Canada Pension Plan provide for costs, I am not making any ruling or award in respect of the costs of these Appeals.\n[128] There were six Notices of Appeal that were the subject of the trial, i.e., an EI Notice of Appeal and a CPP Notice of Appeal for each of Skylight, Suresh and Titus. Those Notices of Appeal were drafted by an agent, on behalf of the Appellants, at a time before the Appellants had retained counsel.\n[129] In describing the relief sought, each of the six Notices of Appeal alleged that the particular Appellant\u2019s rights were violated by the conduct of a named employee of the CRA, and then went on to request that this Court award damages against the Minister for the unreasonable conduct of that employee. The granting of such relief is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court; therefore, I have ignored this particular claim for relief. Although this type of relief is beyond my jurisdiction, and notwithstanding the shortcomings in the various Reports prepared by the Officers (as indicated above), I will note that I found the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer to be courteous and polite, as well as sincere, respectful and moderate in the manner in which they approached the duties of their employment. These comments are intended only to provide my impression of the Rulings Officer and the Appeals Officer in respect of their appearance as witnesses in the trial of these Appeals. If the Appellants decide to pursue their claim for damages in a court that does have jurisdiction to grant such relief, my comments in this paragraph should not be construed as in any way addressing the evidence or the issues that may come before that court.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 28th day of February 2024.\n\u201cDon R.

Overview: [1] This is a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) matter, involving Canadian resource property (CRP) as defined in the federal Income Tax Act (Act).[1]\n[2] In 2008, the Appellant DEML Investments Limited\u2019s parent corporation paid $50,688,330 to acquire the shares of a corporation holding a 99% interest in a partnership of which it was a partner. The partnership held resource property primarily consisting of petroleum and natural gas (PNG) rights, which constitute CRP, and as well depreciable property. After several admitted avoidance transactions, by January 30, 2009 the resource property held by the Appellant was valued at $59,363,463. As well, in relation to that resource property the Appellant now had continuation of entitlement to approximately $47 million in resource tax pools.\n[3] By February 1, 2009, the Appellant\u2019s interest in the partnership had low value and an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $45,850,237. On November 30, 2010, the Appellant disposed of its partnership interest and accordingly claimed a $45,850,237 capital loss (Capital Loss), virtually all of which the Appellant sought to carry-back to offset a substantial capital gain reported in its 2007 taxation year.\n[4] The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) viewed the claimed Capital Loss as an artificial loss and denied it on the basis of GAAR. The Minister maintains that various admitted avoidance transactions involving the CRP of the resource property resulted in abuse or misuse of provisions of the Act, including capital loss and \u201cbump\u201d provisions, thus justifying the appealed GAAR reassessments of the Appellant\u2019s 2010 and 2007 taxation years.[2]\n[5] The Appellant admits that certain transactions relating to the said resource property primarily consisting of CRP were avoidance transactions, and pursuant to section 245 of the Act the claimed Capital Loss (and carry-back) was a tax benefit. The Appellant says however that no avoidance transactions abused or misused any provisions of the Act, and thus the appealed reassessments are wrong.\n[6] Provisions of the Act referred to herein are reproduced in the annex to these reasons for judgment.\nII. Issue: [7] The issue is whether any avoidance transaction(s) in this matter circumvented, defeated or frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of any provisions of the Act, so as to justify the Minister\u2019s application of GAAR in denying the Appellant\u2019s 2010 Capital Loss and carry-back to 2007 to offset a capital gain.\nIII. Evidence: [8] At the hearing, the parties tendered an agreed statement of facts and true copies of relevant documentation, without oral testimony.\n[9] The pertinent facts are the following, including agreement as to the tax benefit and seven avoidance transactions:\n-the Appellant during its 2007 to 2010 taxation years was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Direct Energy), a Canadian energy company;\n-in its 2007 taxation year, the Appellant reported a substantial capital gain;\n-in early 2008, Direct Energy chose to acquire certain Canadian oil and gas properties (Resource Properties) owned by Transglobe Energy Corporation (Transglobe), an international exploration and production company based in Calgary;\n-the Resource Properties consisted of:\n(a) PNG rights, which constituted CRP;\n(b) tangible property used to produce oil and natural gas, which constituted depreciable property as defined in the Act and classified as Class 41 property; and\n(c) miscellaneous interests of nominal value consisting of property necessary to operate the Resource Properties;\n-at all relevant times Direct Energy and Transglobe dealt with each other at arm\u2019s length;\n-in early 2008, Direct Energy entered into an agreement with Transglobe to acquire the Resource Properties. To implement the agreement, Direct Energy and Transglobe arranged and undertook certain pre\u2011acquisition transactions (Steps 1 to 4, following);\n- Step 1: on January 28, 2008 and March 25, 2008 respectively, Transglobe caused incorporation of two numbered companies that were wholly-owned subsidiaries, being 1377116 Alberta Ltd. (137) and 1389673 Alberta Ltd. (138);\n- Step 2: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on April 22, 2008, 137 and 138 formed the Transglobe Energy Partnership (DERP2);\n- Step 3: Transglobe transferred 99% of the Resource Properties to 137 and the remaining 1% to 138. The parties elected per subsection 85(1) of the Act re these transfers;\n- Step 4: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) 137 and 138 transferred the Resource Properties to their DERP2 partnership. They and DERP2 elected per subsection 97(2) of the Act re these transfers, at costs of $1 for the CRP and $11.3 million for the depreciable property;\n- Step 5: on April 30, 2008 Direct Energy acquired from Transglobe the shares of 137 and 138 for $56.7 million less adjustments, for a net purchase price of $51,200,333 broken down as follows - $50,688,330 for the shares of 137 and $512,003 for the shares of 138. Immediately following, Direct Energy\u2019s ACB of its shares of 137 was $50,688,330;\n- Steps 6 to 10 include the wind-up of 137 and transfer of the Resource Properties from DERP2;\n- Step 6: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on January 28, 2009, Direct Energy transferred its shares of 137 to the Appellant. They elected per subsection 85(1) of the Act re the roll-over transfer. The Appellant acquired the shares of 137 at a cost of $50,688,330 (equal to Direct Energy\u2019s ACB in the shares). At that time, the fair market value of the shares of 137 was $55,068,750;\n- Step 7: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on the following day, January 29, 2009, 137 distributed to the Appellant its property, consisting of its 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership, with an ACB of $11.3 million. Then 137 was wound-up and dissolved;\n- Step 8: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on the following day, January 30, 2009, the Appellant made a \u201cbump\u201d designation under paragraph 88(1)(d) of the Act for its acquisition of the 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership. The Appellant relied on this designation to claim a $39,402,330 increase (from $11,286,000 to the said $50,688,330) to its cost of acquisition, i.e. ACB, of the 99% designated interest in the DERP2 partnership. The Appellant also was deemed to be the same corporation and a continuation of 137 for the purpose of the Resource Properties. The Appellant increased its cumulative Canadian oil and gas property expenses (CCOGPE) tax pool by $34,859,099 and its UCC by $11,286,000;\n- Step 9: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on January 30, 2009, DERP2 distributed the Resource Properties to the Appellant as a return of capital of $59,363,463. This was the then fair market value of the Resource Properties. Of that amount $41,512,833 was allocated to the PNG rights, i.e. CRP; $12,112,166 to the Class 41 depreciable property; $3,783,463 to working capital and $1 to miscellaneous interests. This distribution reduced the Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest by the said fair market value (from $50,688,431 to $(8,675,032)).[3] The Appellant\u2019s CCOGPE balance was increased by the fair market value of the PNG rights;[4]\n- on January 31, 2009, being DERP2\u2019s fiscal year end, DERP2\u2019s proceeds of distribution for the CRP (the PNG rights) was allocated to its partners. The Appellant\u2019s CCOGPE balance was reduced by $43,077,705. The Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest increased by the said $43,077,705 to the amount of $34,402,673;\n- Step 10: on the next day, February 1, 2009, the Appellant transferred the assets it acquired from DERP2 to another partnership (LP1). Following this transfer the Appellant held a minority interest in LP1. The remaining interests in LP1 were held by persons related to the Appellant;\n- between June and October 2010, Direct Energy decided to divest itself of certain of the Resource Properties that were located in the Redwater district (Redwater Properties). To effect sale of the Redwater Properties, the Appellant arranged for undertaking of the following transactions (Steps 11 and 12). At all relevant times the Appellant and the intended purchaser, Orion Oil & Gas Corporation (Orion), dealt with each other at arm\u2019s length;\n- Step 11: (admitted Avoidance Transaction) on November 29, 2010, LP1 transferred the Redwater Properties (valued at $6.7 million) to the Appellant. The Appellant in turn transferred the Redwater Properties back into DERP2. The Appellant and DERP2 elected per subsection 97(2) of the Act respecting that transfer. As a result of the transfer, the Appellant\u2019s ACB of its DERP2 partnership interest increased by approx. $6.7 million;\n- Step 12: on November 30, 2010, the Appellant sold to Orion its DERP2 partnership interest and its shares in 138, for a base purchase price of $6.7 million;\n- for its 2010 taxation year the Appellant reported the aforesaid Capital Loss of $45,850,237, from disposition of its DERP2 partnership interest. The Appellant had reported an ACB in the DERP2 partnership interest of $52,550,237 and proceeds of disposition of $6.7 million;\n- the Appellant \u201ccarried back\u201d and deducted in computing its taxable income for its 2007 taxation year $44,879,994 of the Capital Loss, as a net capital loss from its 2010 taxation year, to offset the capital gain the Appellant had reported in its 2007 taxation year;\n- the Minister on reassessment determined the Capital Loss to be nil and reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2007 taxation year to deny the deduction of the net capital loss in that taxation year from the 2010 taxation year;\n- the deduction by the Appellant in computing taxable income for the 2007 taxation year of a portion ($44,879,994) of the Capital Loss is a tax benefit (Tax Benefit) as defined under subsection 245(1) of the Act.\n- Direct Energy had a business purpose for agreeing to acquire the Resource Properties: their production and development potential were geographically adjacent to Direct Energy\u2019s core properties, and the properties were geologically similar to Direct Energy\u2019s core assets, primarily conventional natural gas;\n- the parties agree that each of the transactions described at Step 2, Step 4, Step 6, Step 7, Step 8, Step 9 and Step 11 above:\na. resulted directly or indirectly, alone or as part of a series of transactions, in the Tax Benefit;\nb. was arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit;\nc. may not reasonably be considered to be a transaction undertaken or arranged primarily for a purpose other than to obtain the Tax Benefit; and\nd. is an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d per subsection 245(3) of the Act.\nIV. GAAR: [10] Section 245 of the Act (the GAAR provision) provides as follows (excluding subsection (1) definitions except for \u201ctax benefit\u201d):\n245(1) \u201ctax benefit\u201d means reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act, and includes a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount that would be payable under this Act but for a tax treaty or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act as a result of a tax treaty;\n245(2) General anti-avoidance provision [GAAR] - where a transaction is an avoidance transaction, the tax consequences to a person shall be determined, as is reasonable in the circumstances in order to deny a tax benefit that, but for this section, would result, directly, or indirectly, from that transaction, or from a series of transactions that includes that transaction.\n245(3) Avoidance transaction - an avoidance transaction means any transaction\n(a) that, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit; or\n(b) that is partly of a series of transactions, which series, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.\n245(4) Application of subsection (2) - Subsection 2 applies to a transaction only if it may reasonably be considered that the transaction\n(a) would, if this Act were read without reference to this section, result directly or indirectly in a misuse of the provisions of any one or more of\n(i) this Act, (ii) the Income Tax Regulations, (iii) the Income Tax Application Rules, (iv) a tax treaty, or (v) any other enactment that is relevant in computing tax or any other amount payable by or refundable to a person under this act or in determining any amount that is relevant for the purposes of that computation; or\n(b) would result directly or indirectly in an abuse having regard to those provisions, other than this section, read as a whole.\nV. Issue and Parties\u2019 Positions: [11] As stated, the sole issue is whether per paragraph 245(4) any avoidance transaction(s) undertaken or arranged to achieve the Tax Benefit resulted directly or indirectly in abuse or misuse of any provision(s) of the Act.\n[12] Answering this is a two-step process \u2013 first, to determine the object, spirit and purpose (OSP) of relevant provisions of the Act through a unified textual, contextual and purposive approach; and second, to determine whether an avoidance transaction or series of avoidance transactions frustrated or defeated the OSP of relevant provisions of the Act.\n[13] The Appellant submits that its position is justified by the Act\u2019s resource rules, stating that they applied as intended and that the legislative text supports three \u201ckey points\u201d. These points are:\n(a) CRP is neither capital property, nor inventory, therefore it receives its own special treatment under the Act;\n(b) the cost associated with acquiring CRP is not tied to the property itself, but allocated to certain resource tax pools. CRP does not have an ACB associated with it. When a taxpayer acquires or disposes of CRP, the tax pools\u2019 balances accordingly increase or decrease; and\n(c) when CRP is owned by a partnership, the costs associated with that property are tracked at the partner level, not at the partnership level.[5]\n[14] Also, the Appellant cites CRA Ruling 2005\u20130147681R3 entitled \u201cTransfer of Canadian Resource Properties\u201d, which the Appellant says presents a similar series of transactions to those herein, and then concluding that the GAAR would not apply. The 2005 Ruling states also that it, \u201cmay not represent the current position of the CRA.\u201d[6]\nVI. Resource Property Provisions: [15] The Act provides for differing regimes in recognizing costs incurred to acquire differing types of properties. Three such regimes are relevant in this matter, in determining whether there was statutory abuse in a GAAR context. They are:\n(a) the capital gain\/loss regime which relates to acquisition costs of capital property;\n(b) the CCA regime which is pertinent to acquisition costs of depreciable property; and\n(c) the CCOGPE tax pools regime, pertinent to acquisition costs of Canadian resource property, i.e. CRP.\n[16] Costs pertaining to CRP acquisitions are added to the CCOGPE tax pool. The concept of ACB, applicable in the context of capital property, does not apply to CRP acquisition costs, as CRP is not capital property, per the section 54 definition of \u201ccapital property\u201d and subparagraphs 39(1)(a)(ii) and 39(1)(b)(ii).\n[17] The CCOGPE tax pool (one of three tax pools) is established by paragraphs 66.4(5)(a) and (b) of the Act. CRP costs allocated to this pool include costs of acquiring CRP relevant to the oil and gas industry such as for land, licences, permits, exploration rights, leases, wells and royalty interests. This includes the PNG rights relevant in this appeal; with CRP being a prominent portion of the Resource Properties.\n[18] The Appellant asserts that CRP triggers special treatment. As stated, CRP does not have an ACB associated with it as it is not capital property pursuant to section 54 and subparagraphs 39(1)(a)(ii) and 39(1)(b)(ii). The latter two provisions also provide that no capital gain or loss can be realized on property that is CRP.[7]\n[19] Also, the Appellant notes that CRP is not depreciable property, due to subsection 13(21) which limits depreciable property to being property for which capital cost allowance may be claimed under paragraph 20(1)(a).[8]\n[20] The Appellant submits that as CRP is not capital property and no ACB may be associated with it, the cost of acquiring CRP is instead recognized by way of tax pools, in particular the CCOGPE tax pool. Per paragraph 66.4(2)(b) a taxpayer\u2019s CCOGPE balance is deductible in calculating a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year on a 10 percent declining balance. When CRP is disposed of, the taxpayer\u2019s CCOGPE balance is reduced by the amount of proceeds of disposition of the CRP.\nVII. Analysis: [21] The Respondent submits that capital loss provisions of the Act were abused. The Respondent asserts that the Appellant, in claiming the Capital Loss, claimed an artificial or paper loss, and not a real loss.\n[22] The Appellant refutes that submission, saying there was no abuse and that the claimed Capital Loss arose due to \u201cthe unique features of the resource rules [which] specifically contemplate different tax results than are available in any other regime in the Act.\u201d[9]\n[23] The Respondent submits also that the \u201cbump\u201d rules in the Act were abused.\n[24] The Appellant responds that the \u201cbump\u201d rules in the Act were applied as intended.\n[25] In the recent decision of Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada, 2023 SCC 16, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that GAAR was added to the Act (in 1988) due to \u201cabusive tax avoidance\u201d brought on by \u201ccreative tax planners.\u201d\n[26] Rowe J., writing the 7\/1 majority opinion in Deans Knight, referenced this as follows (underlining added):[10]\n42. [Prior to the GAAR coming into force in 1988]\u2026abusive tax avoidance had become a problem of significant concern for Parliament. Taxpayers, aided by expert advice, increasingly devised complex legal transactions to avoid tax in ways unintended by Parliament. Once the avoidance mechanisms relied on became evident, either from advance ruling requests or tax assessments, Parliament would react to \u2018plug\u2019 the loopholes in the [Income Tax] Act to prevent future use. The problem was that increasingly convoluted rules were vulnerable, creating new loopholes to exploit\u2026. As this \u2018cycle of action and reaction\u2019 between creative tax planners and Parliament continued, the Act grew in size and complexity\u2026\n44. The GAAR was Parliament\u2019s chosen mechanism to interrupt this cycle...\n[27] The GAAR, \u201cconfers\u2026the unusual duty of going beyond the words of the legislation\u201d in applying the three-step GAAR analysis, described as follows:[11]\n51. \u2026\u2018[i]t is relatively straightforward to set out the GAAR scheme. It is much more difficult to apply it\u2019\u2026 This is because the GAAR confers upon courts the \u2018unusual duty of going behind the words of the legislation\u2019... While the duty imposed by the GAAR is unusual, the analysis involves a structured, three-step test that has been the subject of thorough guidance by this Court. In order for the GAAR to apply, the following questions must be asked\u2026 (1) Was there a tax benefit? (2) Was the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit an avoidance transaction? (3) Was the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit abusive?\n52. \u2026at the third step, the Minister bears the burden of proving that the avoidance transaction results in an abuse. (underlining added)\n[28] Regarding the first of these three questions (was there a tax benefit?), the parties agree that the Appellant\u2019s claimed deduction for its 2007 taxation year of $44,879,994 of the total $45,850,237 Capital Loss from its disposition in its 2010 taxation year of its DERP2 partnership interest, is the Tax Benefit per subsection 245(1) of the Act.[12]\n[29] As for the second question (was the transaction giving rise to the Tax Benefit an avoidance transaction?), the parties concur that seven of the twelve transactional steps as set out above were avoidance transactions \u2013 being steps 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The parties accept, per the subsection 245(3) definition of avoidance transaction, that each of these avoidance transactions was arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit, i.e. the Capital Loss claimed by the Appellant.\n[30] It is the third of these questions (was\/were the avoidance transaction(s) that gave rise to the Tax Benefit abusive?) that is at issue herein.\n[31] In Deans Knight Rowe, J. addressed this third stage question in applying the GAAR as follows (under the heading, \u201cThe Abuse Analysis Focuses on Whether the Result of the Transactions Frustrates the Provision\u2019s Object, Spirit and Purpose\u201d):\nAt the abuse stage, the avoidance transactions will be abusive where the outcome or result of the avoidance transaction \u2018(a) is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; (b) defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions relied on; or (c) circumvents certain provisions in a manner that frustrates the object, spirit and purpose of those provisions\u2019 (Lipson, at para. 40, citing Trustco, at para. 45). These considerations are not independent of one another and frequently overlap (Copthorne, at para. 72). Ultimately, the analysis remains squarely focused on abuse. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction \u201cmust be clear\u201d (Trustco, at paras. 62 and 66; Copthorne, at para. 68; Alta Energy, at para. 33).[13] (underlining added)\n[32] Also, it was made clear that the GAAR may apply regardless of precisely worded provisions:\nImportantly, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule. Thus, I do not agree with the appellant\u2019s submission that where Parliament has legislated with precision, as here, where loss carryovers are denied in specific instances, the GAAR is not meant to play a role. Of course, the GAAR will not apply in all circumstances - the analysis is inherently case specific. Further, the way a provision has been drafted is important within the text, context and purpose analysis, since it may shed light on the conduct that Parliament sought to target and how it went about doing so. But the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s.245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules were being circumvented through abusive tax planning, and that such rules were among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions\u2026[14] (underlining added)\n[33] Rowe J. added:[15]\nIn summary, at the third stage of the GAAR analysis:\n-The object spirit and purpose is a description of the provision\u2019s underlying rationale. The means (the how) do not always provide a full answer as to the rationale underlying the provision (the why).\n-The text, context and purpose of a provision provide indicia of its rationale. The text can shed light on what the provision was designed to encourage or prevent based on what it expressly permits or restricts, how it is worded and structured, and the nature of the provision. Similarly, the context can serve to identify the function of the provision within a coherent scheme.\n-Finally, the provision\u2019s purpose can help to discern the outcomes that Parliament sought to achieve or prevent.\n-Once the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis goes beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions to consider whether the result frustrates the provision\u2019s rationale. (underlining added)\nVIII. Assertions of abuse: [34] The Respondent asserts two categories of abuse of provisions of the Act. The first abuse assertion is in respect of certain capital loss provisions of the Act. The second is in respect of \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act utilized to increase the ACB of the Appellant\u2019s DERP2 partnership interest, enabling increase of the claimed Capital Loss.\n[35] I first address the claimed abuse of capital loss provisions of the Act that were applied to obtain the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit. The capital loss provisions of the Act said to have been abused are paragraphs 3(b), 38(b) and 11(b), subparagraphs 39(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and definitions \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8).[16]\n[36] As noted, there are two parts to the abuse analysis. The first is establishment of the OSP of the statutory provisions at issue. The second is establishment that one or more avoidance transactions of the Appellant abused the OSP of those provisions.\n[37] In Triad Gestco Ltd. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 258, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) accepted the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive analysis\u201d of the specified capital loss provisions, as follows:\n50. Addressing this question, Justice Paris in the companion case conducted a textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the provisions relied upon by the appellant in order to obtain the tax benefit (1207192 Ontario Ltd., paras. 63 to 68 and 84 to 93). He properly identified each of the relevant provisions and their reason for being. I agree with his conclusion that these provisions, in particular paragraph 38(b), provide relief as an offset against capital gain where a taxpayer has suffered an economic loss on the disposition of property. I also agree with his further conclusion that offsetting a capital gain with the paper loss that was claimed results in an abuse and a misuse of the relevant provisions, specifically paragraphs 38(b), 39(1)(b) and 40(1)(b) (1207192 Ontario Ltd., paras. 92 and 93).\n51. The appellant correctly points out that the words \u201ceconomic loss\u201d on which Justice Paris relied in identifying the underlying rationale do not appear in any of the relevant provisions. However, there is no objection at this stage of the analysis to departing from the bare meaning of the words provided that the reading proposed is supported by a textual, contextual and purposive reading of the relevant provisions (Copthorne Holdings, para. 70). Given their purpose \u2013 i.e. to tax the net realized increase in the value of capital assets - it is not possible, in my view, to read the relevant provisions otherwise. (underlining added)\n[38] The capital loss provisions addressed in Triad Gestco (paragraphs 38(b), 39(1)(b) and 40(1)(b)) are included in the capital loss provisions that in this appeal the Crown has claimed were abused (sections 3, 38, 39, 40, 53 and 54). The underlying rationale of the capital loss provisions identified in Triad Gestco is that a capital loss offsetting a capital gain is to be reflective of \u201can economic loss on the disposition of property\u201d. That is, the loss cannot be an artificial or paper loss.\n[39] Here the Minister determined there was no real or economic loss, as stated in the Respondent\u2019s written submissions, paragraph 170, as follows:\n170. The appellant\u2019s capital loss does not reflect any kind of impoverishment on the part of the appellant. The entire capital loss relies on ACB from transactions that occurred in a period \u2013 the period from April 2008 until January 30, 2009 - during which the Resource Properties increased in value by $8,675,133 from the price paid by Direct Energy for the shares in 137. All of the price paid by Direct Energy for those shares was indirectly attributable to the Resource Properties. During this period there were no transactions involving the appellant and DERP2 other than those involving the Resource Properties. At the end of the period, the appellant held the Resource Properties at a value of over $59 million.[17] [underlining added]\n[40] As indicated by this statement, the Respondent observes that while the Appellant claimed the Capital Loss of some $45 million, at the same time the value of the Resource Properties, held by the Appellant, had increased by over $8 million from when purchased by the Appellant\u2019s parent Direct Energy, to an amount exceeding $59 million. This does not indicate there having been any loss, let alone one of some $45 million.\n[41] The Appellant asserts that, for resource properties, gain or loss is not based on any particular resource property but rather \u201con a pool-wide basis by increasing or decreasing CCOGPE as the case may be.\u201d[18]\n[42] That is so, however I do not accept that that constrains a GAAR analysis from viewing the pertinent circumstances in a general and common-sense basis.\n[43] The Appellant did not show that the claimed Capital Loss (i.e., the Tax Benefit) was a real loss, as opposed to being an artificial or paper loss. To the contrary, the Capital Loss was reflective of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest that per Step 8 had been substantially \u201cbumped\u201d per paragraph 88(1)(d). That does not reflect any actual as opposed to paper loss. The Appellant acknowledges that this Step 8 was an avoidance transaction, and as such, \u201cwas arranged and undertaken primarily for the purpose of obtaining the Tax Benefit.\u201d[19]\n[44] Thus, I conclude that the Appellant has claimed an artificial loss, rather than a true loss, not abiding by the OSP of the capital loss provisions of the Act, as pronounced by the FCA in Triad Gestco. Also, it is apparent that the approx. $51 million that Direct Energy paid for the shares of 137 would be due to the value of the 99% interest in the Resource Properties that 137 held, most all of which was CRP, and which by January 30, 2009 had increased in value to more than $59 million. That certainly is not indicative of any loss.\n[45] This breach of the OSP of capital loss provisions of the Act is a clear abuse of those provisions \u2013 i.e., paragraphs 3(b), 38(b), 39(1)(b), 40(1)(b) and 111(1)(b), the definition \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8). Consistent with the OSP of these provisions, these provisions are abused when utilized in respect of artificial or paper losses as opposed to real losses.\n[46] The Appellant refutes the proposition that it abused the capital gain\/loss provisions of the Act. The Appellant submits that the loss pertaining to its claimed Capital Loss is due to the \u201cunique\u201d provisions in the Act respecting CRP. The provisions \u201cspecifically contemplate different tax results than are available in any other regime in the Act.\u201d[20]\n[47] GAAR, where the applicable OSP has been abused, should prevent a taxpayer from doing indirectly what cannot be done directly. Applying the GAAR turns on viewing what has actually happened. Here the substantial Capital Loss was claimed where there was no economic loss or impoverishment, thus per Triad Gestco breaching the OSP of the Act\u2019s capital loss provisions, including paragraph 39(1)(b).\n[48] In that context it is abusive where a capital loss nevertheless was claimed based on the value of a partnership interest, which value derives from the CRP (of the Resource Properties) while held by that partnership. So here, CRP was made indirectly the basis for the claimed capital loss. As said, this is tax planning to do indirectly what cannot be done directly, and GAAR exists to deal with such situations.\n[49] Furthermore, on November 30, 2010 when the DERP2 partnership interest was disposed of, creating the subject Capital Loss, the agreed statement of facts indicates that the Appellant continued to own the Resource Properties (minus a portion referenced as the Redwater Properties), acquired from the DERP2 partnership a year earlier (Step 9). Thus, the Appellant remained entitled to the CCOGPE and UCC tax pools pertaining to the Resource Properties while also enjoying an increase in the value of the Resource Properties of more than $8 million. This is all while the Appellant was seeking to benefit from the carry\u2011back to 2007 of most of the claimed Capital Loss \u2013 which was a paper loss only \u2013 to offset the substantial capital gain reported in that year.\n[50] I find that is abusive of the capital loss provisions, which are not intended to be useable for CRP based value, particularly while at the same time there remains entitlement to the CCOGPE and UCC tax pools. That appears why the Act does not want CRP involved with claimed capital losses. The CCOPEG cost regime applies to CRP; not either the capital loss\/gain cost regime or CCA cost regimes.\n[51] The Appellant cites also the above-mentioned CRA Ruling - # 2005\u20110147681R3. In this Ruling, issued in 2006, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) held that a partnership that no longer owned certain resource properties, which generated a high ACB, could still preserve that ACB. However, in that Ruling the CRA did not take a position with regards to claimed capital losses on a partnership interest in such a partnership, which is the situation in the present matter. Nor did the Ruling deal with ACB that had been \u201cbumped\u201d for the purposes of increasing a capital loss to be applied against a previously reported capital gain.\n[52] Furthermore, the FCA has warned that prior rulings and opinions provided by the CRA are \u201cof little assistance\u201d in GAAR cases. The courts are not bound by the opinion of the Minister or CRA. Determining the object, spirit and purpose of a provision is a question of law and is the sole responsibility of the courts.[21]\n[53] The series of avoidance transactions defeats the underlying rationale of the capital loss provisions by carrying back a loss where there is no economic loss. Following Triad Gestco there is abuse where a capital loss is carried back without any corresponding economic loss.\n[54] Of particular note, in 2763478 Canada Inc. v. Canada, 2018 FCA 209, the FCA wrote:\nThe appellant points out that the phrases \u201cpaper loss\u201d and \u201ceconomic\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d loss appear nowhere in the ITA\u2026 That is so, but as the Supreme Court explained in Copthorne (paragraph 70), construction focused on the object, spirit and purpose of a provision may give it a broader meaning than a construction which focuses on the words (to the same effect, see Triad Gestco, at paragraph 51). When one considers the object, spirit and purpose of the capital gains regime, it seems clear that allowing a paper loss to offset a true gain would frustrate its reason for being.[22] [emphasis added]\n[55] The Appellant argues that Triad Gestco should be distinguished in favour of the reasoning applied in Donahue Forest Products Inc.[23] As a matter of jurisprudence, the Triad Gestco decision is quite more recent. In Donahue, the FCA affirms that there is \u201cnothing in the Act that bars the taxpayer from realizing a loss on the sale of shares to arm\u2019s length of third parties, even if a significant portion of the assets to which the loss on the shares may be attributed remains within the group of corporations.\u201d However, unlike the present fact situation, in Donohue there was a true economic loss - following the collapse of the price of wood pulp, Donahue Inc.\u2019s investment became worthless. This crucial distinction as to real versus false loss, calls for, in the present case, the application of Triad Gestco rather than Donohue.\n[56] As the purpose of the capital loss provisions is to recognize real losses, there is clear abuse where artificial losses are deducted. That is even more so when those losses are based on non-capital CRP, that will also be deducted through CCOGPE pools at a 100% inclusion rate thus creating a double deduction. As the Appellant stated, CRP is not capital property and does not have an ACB \u2013 therefore, how can it be the economic basis for a capital loss.\n[57] The avoidance transactions at issue undermine the integrity of the capital gains and loss scheme of the Act, in addition to benefitting from the CCOGPE tax pool.\n[58] Accordingly, I conclude that from a GAAR perspective that in this matter there was abuse of the identified capital loss provisions arising from the avoidance transactions.\n[59] I now address the Respondent\u2019s second abuse submission, that avoidance transactions undertaken to achieve the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit, through augmenting the ACB of the Appellant\u2019s DERP2 partnership interest, abused provisions of the Act. The provisions are paragraphs 88(1)(b), (c) and (d), subparagraphs 39(1)(b)(i) and (ii), paragraphs 3(b), 38(b) and 111(b) and the definitions \u201cadjusted cost base\u201d in section 54 and \u201cnet capital loss\u201d in subsection 111(8), subparagraph 53(1)(e)(viii), section 66.4 and subsection 66(13) of the Act.\n[60] The subsection 88(1) \u201cbump\u201d provisions are described in Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30 at paragraph 76, 77 and 78, as follows:\n76. In vertical amalgamation, paragraph 88(1)(a) deems the parent corporation to have acquired the property of its subsidiary at the subsidiary\u2019s tax cost. Prior to the wind-up, however, it is possible that the parent\u2019s tax cost of the shares in its subsidiary (the ACB of the shares) will exceed the tax cost of the subsidiary\u2019s underlying property. Upon a vertical amalgamation, these shares will disappear. Without further adjustment, the tax cost in those shares would also disappear, thereby giving rise to potential double taxation in the event that the underlying property is subsequently sold. This is because the deemed cost of the underlying property in the hands of the parent, being equal to the subsidiary\u2019s tax cost, would not reflect any appreciation in value up to the time of the wind-up.\n77. The bump provided for in paragraphs 88(1)(c) and (d) rectifies this situation by first calculating the difference between the ACB of the parent\u2019s shares and the tax cost of the subsidiary\u2019s property. This amount is then allowed to be added to the tax cost of the non-depreciable capital property which the parent inherited from its subsidiary. In other words, the tax cost of this property is bumped. The bump essentially allows any ACB that would otherwise be lost on a vertical amalgamation to be preserved and transferred to different property that is taxed the same way.\n78. Subparagraph 88(1)(c)(iii) prohibits the parent from bumping the cost of \u201cineligible property\u201d which includes depreciable property. The issue the bumps seeks to address is the disappearance of the shares and the tax cost (the shares\u2019 ACB) embedded therein. Preserving and transferring ACB that would otherwise be lost to an asset that is taxed with the same rate of inclusion is the way in which this is accommodated. Allowing property that is taxed on the basis of a 50% rate of inclusion to augment the value of property that is taxed on the basis of a 100% rate of inclusion would result in an obvious revenue loss. That explains why depreciable property or other types of property that give rise to a 100% rate of inclusion cannot be bumped.\n[61] In this matter, 137 was the wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent the Appellant. Per Step 7, being an avoidance transaction, on January 29, 2009 137 distributed its property (99% interest in DERRP2 partnership) to its parent the Appellant. 137 was then wound-up and dissolved.\n[62] The Step 8 avoidance transaction closely followed, whereby the Appellant made a paragraph 88(1)(d) designation respecting its acquisition from 137 of the 99% interest in the DERP2 partnership. This \u201cbump\u201d designation of the capital property allowed the Appellant to claim a $39,402,330 increase to the cost at which it had acquired the said partnership interest. The cost thus ACB went from $11,286,101 to $50,688,431. And then on the following day, January 30, 2009, DERP2 distributed the Resource Properties to the Appellant.\n[63] Paragraph 88(1)(c) sets out the basic eligibility criteria for the bump (also known as the bump denial rules). These rules include that the property must be capital property of the subsidiary at the time the parent acquired control of the subsidiary. CRP is specifically excluded from capital property, per subparagraph 39(1)(b)(ii). Thus, CRP cannot be bumped. The property must not be \u201cineligible property\u201d, such as depreciable property.[24]\n[64] But for the bump rules, the parent\u2019s tax cost in the subsidiary\u2019s shares would disappear on the wind-up and the parent would lose that positive tax attribute to shelter future capital gains.\n[65] Note that subparagraph 88(1)(d)(ii.1) was introduced in 2013, well after the transactions relating to this present appeal. This anti-avoidance provision ended the practice of bumping ACBs of partnership interests where the fair market value of the partnership was derived from ineligible assets, such as depreciable property or CRP.\n[66] The FCA examined the object, spirit, and purpose of paragraph 88(1)(d) in the Queen v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30. In that case, the taxpayer undertook a complex series of transactions, which involved rolling three real estate properties, through a tiered partnership structure, increasing (bumping) the ACB of the partnership interest and selling the partnership interests to tax-exempt entities without tax being paid on the latent recapture, and accrued gains in the property being held by the partnerships. Essentially, the taxpayer avoided latent recapture under subsection 100(1) and eliminated capital gains on the sale of their partnership interests.\n[67] To my mind there is a ready answer as to whether the \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act have been abused in the circumstances at bar. It was the \u201cbump\u201d of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest that led to the very substantial increase of the Capital Loss\/Tax Benefit, while not reflective of any real loss as discussed above. Thus, as concluded above, the capital gain\/loss provisions of the Act were abused or misused.\n[68] The primary tool for doing this was the \u201cbump\u201d mechanism of the Act, causing the increasing of ACBs. It thus appears obvious that likewise the \u201cbump\u201d provisions in subsection 88(1) of the Act were abused, for having been the legislative tool used for creation of the artificial loss reflected by the Capital Loss.\n[69] I note also that the \u201cbump\u201d provisions well fit the category of capital loss provisions of the Act. After all, it is the ACB that is \u201cbumped\u201d; and the ACB is a primary factor in the determination of the amount of a capital gain or loss. Thus the \u201cno artificial loss\u201d OSP of capital loss provisions of the Act encompass also the subsection 88(1) \u201cbump\u201d provisions. Hence, in the context of a GAAR analysis, abuse of these provisions would include the \u201cbump\u201d provisions where the ACB was \u201cbumped\u201d in creation of the artificial loss here underlying the Capital Loss leading to the Tax Benefit.\n[70] Put another way, it seems incomprehensible that an artificial loss would signal misuse of capital loss provisions of the Act without equally indicating misuse of the very \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act used to achieve the artificial loss through the \u201cbumping\u201d of an ACB.\n[71] I accordingly find that the identified \u201cbump\u201d provisions of the Act were likewise misused by the avoidance transactions leading to and including the \u201cbumped\u201d enhancement of the ACB of the DERP2 partnership interest, to enable the Appellant to claim in 2010 the Capital Loss sufficiently sized to be carried\u2011back and set-off against the Appellant\u2019s 2007 capital gain.\nIX. Conclusion: [72] In conclusion, I have found that both of the Respondent\u2019s claims of statutory misuse in a GAAR context have been made out. That being the sole issue, the appeal will be denied, with costs.\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated February 29, 2024, in order to correct the words underscored in paragraphs 5, 9, 10, 18, 36 and 72 hereof.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 11th day of March 2024.\n\u201cB.

Introduction\n[1] The Minister of National Revenue denied Michelle Adams\u2019 application for the disability tax credit (DTC) on the basis that her celiac disease symptoms and treatment do not meet the relevant criteria under the Income Tax Act (Act).[1]\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Minister\u2019s decision. Ms. Adams does not qualify for the DTC because she does not have a marked restriction in feeding herself within the meaning of that term in the Act.\n[3] The DTC provisions specifically exclude activities related to managing dietary restrictions from the activity of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d. Moreover, the inability to absorb nutrients does not qualify as a marked restriction in feeding oneself, otherwise everyone with celiac disease would automatically qualify for the credit. Eligibility for the DTC is not based solely on the existence of a medical condition; taxpayers must still establish a resulting marked restriction in an activity of daily living.\nII. Background\n[4] Ms. Adams applied for the DTC for the 2014 through 2021 taxation years, based on a diagnosis of celiac disease and the steps she takes to manage the disease.\n[5] For several years, Ms. Adams experienced severe stomach pains, fatigue, and vitamin B12 deficiencies. When she was first tested for celiac disease in 2014, the results were negative. After her symptoms persisted and worsened, she was tested again in 2021 and received a formal diagnosis on April 22, 2021. The diagnosis was considered effective as of 2014, after her 2014 samples were re\u2011tested.\n[6] After the diagnosis, Ms. Adams immediately stopped consuming gluten and conducted extensive research to understand celiac disease. Her gastroenterologist also referred her to a registered dietician for \u201cformal counseling on a gluten-free diet\u201d.\n[7] Ms. Adams applied for the DTC in the fall of 2021. Her family physician, Dr. Shawna Phillips, signed the required form on October 14, 2021 (Certificate).[2] In completing the Certificate, Dr. Phillips did not indicate that Ms. Adams was impaired in her ability to perform any of the listed daily activities of living. However, Dr. Phillips did certify that Ms. Adams required therapy to support a vital function, and attached a document prepared by Ms. Adams estimating the amount of time she requires to maintain a gluten-free diet. Dr. Phillips also referred to that same document instead of providing a description of Ms. Adams\u2019 impairment.\n[8] By Notice of Determination dated November 22, 2021, the Minister denied the application on the basis that Ms. Adams was not impaired in her ability to perform one or more activities of daily living, as required under paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) of the Act. The Minister also concluded that Ms. Adams did not require therapy, administered for an average of more than 14 hours per week, within the meaning of paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) and subsection 118.3(1.1).\n[9] In support of her appeal from the Minister\u2019s decision, Ms. Adams relied on a new certificate signed by Dr. Phillips, dated September 8, 2022 (Revised Certificate).[3] In the Revised Certificate, Dr. Phillips indicated that Ms. Adams was impaired in her ability to perform the daily activity of feeding herself.\n[10] In her testimony, Ms. Adams summarized her journey to obtain a diagnosis and manage her disease. She also provided the Court with background information that she learned through her extensive research on celiac disease.\n[11] That information was consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s description of celiac disease in its 2002 decision in Hamilton.[4] Celiac disease is a genetically based, permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in inflammatory damage to the small intestine. If untreated, it can result in severe malnutrition and increased risk of other diseases like lymphoma, osteoporosis, Type I diabetes and reproductive problems. The only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, effectively eliminating wheat, rye, barley, oats, or any products derived from these grains. Celiac disease does not require avoidance of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, or starches that do not contain gluten, such as rice, potatoes and corn. However, a gluten-free diet requires avoiding cross-contamination in processed foods and in food prepared by others, including at restaurants.\n[12] Ms. Adams\u2019 research highlighted the changes in how celiac disease has been recognized and treated since the 2002 Hamilton decision. For example, Health Canada began regulating the sale of food labelled as \u201cgluten-free\u201d in 2012.[5] Only those foods that have been specially processed or formulated to meet the needs of individuals who need to follow a gluten-free diet to protect their health can carry a gluten-free claim.\n[13] Unfortunately, Ms. Adams\u2019 research did not establish that the facts of her case, including her particular symptoms and the steps she takes to manage celiac disease, meet the requirements of the Act.\nIII. Analysis\n[14] The purpose of the DTC is to provide modest tax relief for individuals who fall within the restricted category of markedly physically or mentally impaired persons.[6] While the DTC provisions should be given a humane and compassionate interpretation, the Court cannot disregard clear statutory requirements and restrictions. Attention must be paid to the terms chosen by Parliament.[7]\n[15] The terms used in the DTC provisions have legal meanings that may not align with a layperson\u2019s understanding or even that of a medical professional.[8] For that reason, certification by a medical practitioner does not guarantee eligibility for the credit. This Court must still assess whether the legal requirements of the Act have been met.[9]\nA. The limited scope of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d\n[16] The outcome of this appeal turns on the meaning of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d, a term Parliament amended in 2003 to explicitly exclude the time required to identify, shop for, and prepare food, due to a dietary restriction or regime.[10]\n[17] The amendment was in response to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Hamilton.[11] In that matter, both this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal applied the general principle that \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d includes finding and preparing food that conforms to a medically prescribed diet.[12] Mr. Hamilton, who had to manage dietary restrictions related to celiac disease and diabetes,[13] required an inordinate amount of time to prepare his meals and feed himself compared to ordinary, healthy persons following a routine diet.[14]\n[18] In response, Parliament clarified and limited the scope of the activity of feeding oneself with the addition of the following paragraph to subsection 118.4(1):\n(e) feeding oneself does not include\n(i) any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food, or\n(ii) the activity of preparing food to the extent that the time associated with the activity would not have been necessary in the absence of a dietary restriction or regime;\n[19] In applying these amendments, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the excessive amount of time preparing food is no longer a factor to be considered.[15]\n[20] Ms. Adams\u2019 claim therefore must be considered within the parameters of those provisions. Based on the clear legislative criteria, I cannot conclude that she was markedly restricted in her ability to feed herself.\n1. Time required is not inordinate\n[21] Ms. Adams argued that she is markedly restricted because she requires an inordinate amount of time to feed herself. In support of this argument, she provided an estimate of time for several activities related to managing and treating her celiac disease through a 100% gluten-free diet:[16]\nActivity\nMinutes per week\nMinutes per day\nTreatment: consumption of gluten-free foods (3-5 times per day, 7 days per week)\n525\n75\nTreatment: consumption of vitamins\/supplements that body can\u2019t absorb due to celiac disease (calcium, B12 and Vitamin D) (Once per day, 7 days per week)\n35\n5\nPreparation of gluten-free foods (3-5 times per day, 7 days per week)\n630\n90\nCommunication with people hosting events \/ preparing food to bring to these events\n15\n2\nPreparation of gluten-free food for family and holiday gatherings (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas)\n15\n2\nCommunication with family\/friends in preparation of gatherings to ensure appropriate food is available\n15\n2\nSelf-education and educating others about celiac disease, gluten-free diet, cross-contamination, meal planning, shopping for gluten-free foods, reading labels\n20\nCommunication with restaurants\/staff when eating out about gluten-free food options and minimizing cross-contamination\n30\nReading labels of food items during each grocery visit to ensure items do not contain barley, rye, oats or wheat (gluten-free)\n120\nAttending celiac disease workshops (education, cooking, therapy and support)\n15\nMedical and nutrition appointments and communications\n5.76\nMedical testing\n12.69\nTime roommate spends reading labels for food brought into shared living space\n60\nTotal minutes per week managing\/treating celiac disease\n1498.5\nTotal hours per week\n24.97\n[22] As a preliminary issue, Ms. Adams\u2019 claim for the DTC for 2014 through 2020 cannot succeed because she did not undertake any of these activities until after her diagnosis in 2021.\n[23] The claim for 2021 cannot succeed because the majority of the activities do not fall within the meaning of \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d as limited by paragraph 118.4(1)(e) cited above.\n[24] Time spent on preparation of gluten-free foods is excluded under subparagraph 118.4(1)(e)(ii) as \u201cthe activity of preparing food for a dietary restriction or regime\u201d. Time spent on reading food labels is excluded under subparagraph 188.4(1)(e)(i) as \u201cactivities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food\u201d.\n[25] The following activities also cannot be considered because they are closely tied or analogous to those specifically excluded activities of shopping for and preparing foods, and are too remote from the activity of feeding oneself:\ncommunication with people hosting events\ncommunication with family\/friends in preparation of gatherings\nself-education and educating others\ncommunication with restaurants\/staff when eating out\nattending celiac disease workshops\nmedical and nutrition appointments and communications\n[26] Many of these activities also are repetitive and do not occur regularly enough to warrant a weekly estimate of time.\n[27] While consuming vitamins and supplements could be considered related to the activity of feeding oneself, the estimated time is minimal and comparable to those who consume vitamins and supplements for other reasons.\n[28] The remaining listed activity that falls within the scope of feeding oneself is \u201cconsumption of gluten-free foods\u201d, estimated at 525 minutes per week. In her testimony, Ms. Adams clarified that the 525 minutes was in addition to the 480 minutes per week she estimated for consumption of food before she started a gluten-free diet.[17] She further stated that the time doubled because she needed to consume twice the amount of food to obtain nutrients.\n[29] However, this assertion is not supported by a dietary plan from her treating physician or dietician, or by the research she tendered as evidence.[18] The assertion also does not take into account the nutrients Ms. Adams would obtain from gluten-free food like fruit, vegetables, rice, potatoes, fish, and meat. Ultimately, it is unclear why time to consume food doubles when a gluten-free diet only requires substitution of some, not all foods.\n[30] As a result, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. Adams requires an inordinate amount of time to perform the activity of feeding herself.\n2. No other evidence of marked restriction\n[31] Prior to commencing a gluten-free diet to manage her celiac disease, Ms. Adams had vitamin deficiencies and experienced severe stomach pain and fatigue.\n[32] On their own, those symptoms do not demonstrate a marked impairment in feeding oneself or any of the other activities of daily living listed in the DTC provisions.\n[33] Notably, Ms. Adams\u2019 testimony suggests that her family doctor recognized the disconnect between her symptoms and the DTC criteria. She and her family doctor tried to \u201cunderstand and learn more about how celiac disease interacts with the disability tax credit\u201d. Her family doctor made the change in the Revised Certificate to indicate a marked restriction in feeding on the basis that the \u201ccategory made the most sense at the time\u201d and fit \u201cin terms of the categories that are available for the disability tax credit\u201d.\n[34] Essentially, Ms. Adams and her family doctor determined that feeding oneself includes the ability to absorb nutrients from food. In support of her appeal, Ms. Adams argued that \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d should go beyond the physical aspect of consuming food; it should include the ability to absorb nutrients because that is the purpose of eating.\n[35] While I understand the rationale behind this argument, it cannot succeed because it extends the DTC beyond its intended scope. Simply put, this interpretation would automatically qualify every taxpayer who suffers from celiac disease. While celiac disease results in an impairment, taxpayers must still establish that the effects of the disease fall within the DTC criteria in their particular case.[19]\n[36] In Hamilton, the Federal Court of Appeal held that not everyone with celiac disease is entitled to claim the DTC, and referred to the different outcomes of celiac disease cases heard by this Court in the years prior.[20] The different decisions highlight that evidence plays a critical role in each case. Symptoms of celiac disease vary depending on age, duration, and severity of the disease.[21]\n[37] Evidentiary differences also highlight the limited relevance of non-celiac disease cases for the purpose of deciding this appeal. Ms. Adams\u2019 reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in Hughes is misplaced because the facts are significantly different. In Hughes, the taxpayer\u2019s child had phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disease diagnosed through testing of newborns.[22] If left untreated, PKU affects cognitive ability and leads to permanent, severe brain damage in a matter of weeks.[23] PKU cannot be managed by eliminating a single compound like gluten; it requires constant balancing of levels of a specific protein, using measurements, formula, and medical food sold and labelled as such.[24] The Court therefore determined that there was a marked restriction in the daily activity of \u201cmental functions necessary for everyday life\u201d.[25]\n[38] Ms. Adams argued that a humane, compassionate and common sense interpretation should yield a similar result in her case. However, applying the Court\u2019s findings in Hughes would disregard the clear requirements of the DTC provisions at issue and the different facts of Ms. Adams\u2019 case.\nB. No therapy essential to maintain a vital function\n[39] Ms. Adams also argued that she would be markedly restricted in feeding herself but for the therapy of adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. This argument fails because it is predicated on the faulty assumption that an underlying marked restriction exists. As outlined above, the effects of celiac disease do not lead any marked restrictions in Ms. Adams\u2019 case.\n[40] In any event, her gluten-free diet does not qualify as therapy under paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1) and subsection 118.3(1.1).\n[41] Similar to \u201cfeeding oneself\u201d, Parliament has restricted the term \u201ctherapy\u201d for the purpose of the DTC. The therapy for celiac disease is a dietary restriction or regime excluded from the calculation of time spent as therapy, under the provisions applicable in the 2021 taxation year. That version of paragraph 118.3(1.1)(d) stated that the time spent on therapy:\ndoes not include time spent on activities related to dietary or exercise restrictions or regimes (even if those restrictions or regimes are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication), travel time, medical appointments, shopping for medication or recuperation after therapy.\n[42] This provision excludes the activities Ms. Adams has listed in her calculation of time spent managing and treating her celiac disease.\n[43] Ms. Adams attempted to rely on a subsequent amendment that includes time spent on \u201cthe daily consumption of a medical food or medical formula to limit intake of a particular compound to levels required for the proper development or functioning of the body\u201d.[26] In doing so, Ms. Adams has disregarded the fact that dietary restrictions or regimes are still excluded.[27] Parliament has created a distinction between medical foods and dietary restrictions. A gluten-free diet does not involve the consumption of a medical food or formula.[28]\nIV. Conclusion\n[44] This decision does not speak to the importance of Ms. Adams following a gluten-free diet to address the associated risks of celiac disease and to ultimately live a better, healthier life. The focus of this analysis is the specific legal question of whether Ms. Adams met the criteria to qualify for the DTC. In answering this question, I am bound to apply the clear words and parameters established by Parliament. Ms. Adams does not have a marked restriction in feeding as that term is understood under the Act.\n[45] The appeal is therefore dismissed, without costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 7th day of

that\n(i) is essential to sustain a vital function of the individual,\n(ii) is required to be administered at least three times each week for a total duration averaging not less than 14 hours a week, and\n(iii) cannot reasonably be expected to be of significant benefit to persons who are not so impaired,\n(a.2) in the case of an impairment in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform a single basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted or would be so restricted but for therapy referred to in paragraph (a.1), a medical practitioner has certified in prescribed form that the impairment is a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted or would be markedly restricted, but for therapy referred to in paragraph (a.1), where the medical practitioner is a medical doctor or, in the case of\n(i) a sight impairment, an optometrist,\n(ii) a speech impairment, a speech-language pathologist,\n(iii) a hearing impairment, an audiologist,\n(iv) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in feeding or dressing themself, an occupational therapist,\n(v) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in walking, an occupational therapist, or after February 22, 2005, a physiotherapist, and\n(vi) an impairment with respect to an individual\u2019s ability in mental functions necessary for everyday life, a psychologist,\n(a.3) in the case of one or more impairments in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living is significantly restricted, a medical practitioner has certified in prescribed form that the impairment or impairments are severe and prolonged impairments in physical or mental functions the effects of which are such that the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living is significantly restricted and that the cumulative effect of those restrictions is equivalent to having a marked restriction in the ability to perform a single basic activity of daily living, where the medical practitioner is, in the case of\n(i) an impairment with respect to the individual\u2019s ability in feeding or dressing themself, or in walking, a medical doctor or an occupational therapist, and\n(ii) in the case of any other impairment, a medical doctor,\n(b) the individual has filed for a taxation year with the Minister the certificate described in paragraph (a.2) or (a.3), and\n(c) no amount in respect of remuneration for an attendant or care in a nursing home, in respect of the individual, is included in calculating a deduction under section 118.2 (otherwise than because of paragraph 118.2(2)(b.1)) for the year by the individual or by any other person,\nthere may be deducted in computing the individual\u2019s tax payable under this Part for the year the amount determined by the formula\nA \u00d7 (B + C)\nwhere\nA\nis the appropriate percentage for the year,\nB\nis $6,000,

year\nexceeds\n(B) $2,050, and\n(b) in any other case, zero.\nTime spent on therapy\n118.3(1.1) For the purpose of paragraph 118.3(1)(a.1), in determining whether therapy is required to be administered at least three times each week for a total duration averaging not less than an average of 14 hours a week, the time spent on administering therapy\n(a) includes only time spent on activities that require the individual to take time away from normal everyday activities in order to receive the therapy;\n(b) in the case of therapy that requires a regular dosage of medication that is required to be adjusted on a daily basis, includes (subject to paragraph (d)) time spent on activities that are directly related to the determination of the dosage of the medication;\n(c) in the case of a child who is unable to perform the activities related to the administration of the therapy as a result of the child\u2019s age, includes the time, if any, spent by the child\u2019s primary caregivers performing or supervising those activities for the child; and\n(d) does not include time spent on activities related to dietary or exercise restrictions or regimes (even if those restrictions or regimes are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication), travel time, medical appointments, shopping for medication or recuperation after therapy.\nNature of impairment\n118.4 (1) For the purposes of subsection 6(16), sections 118.2 and 118.3 and this subsection,\n(a) an impairment is prolonged where it has lasted, or can reasonably be expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 months;\n(b) an individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living is markedly restricted only where all or substantially all of the time, even with therapy and the use of appropriate devices and medication, the individual is blind or is unable (or requires an inordinate amount of time) to perform a basic activity of daily living;\n(b.1) an individual is considered to have the equivalent of a marked restriction in a basic activity of daily living only where all or substantially all of the time, even with therapy and the use of appropriate devices and medication, the individual\u2019s ability to perform more than one basic activity of daily living (including for this purpose, the ability to see) is significantly restricted, and the cumulative effect of those restrictions is tantamount to the individual\u2019s ability to perform a basic activity of daily living being markedly restricted;\n(c) a basic activity of daily living in relation to an individual means\n(i) mental functions necessary for everyday life,\n(ii) feeding oneself or dressing oneself,\n(iii) speaking so as to be understood, in a quiet setting, by another person familiar with the individual,\n(iv) hearing so as to understand, in a quiet setting, another person familiar with the individual,\n(v) eliminating (bowel or bladder functions), or\n(vi) walking;\n(c.1) mental functions necessary for everyday life include\n(i) memory,\n(ii) problem solving, goal-setting and judgement (taken together), and\n(iii) adaptive functioning;\n(d) for greater certainty, no other activity, including working, housekeeping or a social or recreational activity, shall be considered as a basic activity of daily living; and\n(e) feeding oneself does not include\n(i) any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring food, or\n(ii) the activity of preparing food to the extent that the time associated with the activity would not have been necessary in the absence of a dietary restriction or regime; and\n(f) dressing oneself does not include any of the activities of identifying, finding, shopping for or otherwise procuring clothing.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 28\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-1952(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMichelle Adams v.

Bocock\u201d\nBocock J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 29\nDate: 20240313\nDocket: 2023-1435(IT)APP\nBETWEEN:\nLORETTA STO DOMINGO,\nApplicant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nBocock J.\n[1] This application is brought for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under the Income Tax Act against an assessment for the 2012 taxation year and a reassessment for the 2013 taxation year.\n[2] The Applicant, Loretta Sto Domingo (pronounced Santo Domingo), speaks little English. An interpreter presided throughout the hearing. Further, as suggested by the Court at the conclusion of the hearing, Ms. Sto Domingo confirmed written reasons for the Order would be appreciated. Hence, these written reasons.\n[3] There are no disputed facts. In response to the 2012 assessment and 2013 reassessment, Ms. Sto Domingo filed notices of objection to the Minister\u2019s disallowance of charitable donations claimed in those two tax years. The deductions under section 118.1 concerned purported courseware gifts and cash donations under the Global Learning and Gifting Initiative (\u201cGLGI\u201d).\n[4] In response to the objections, the Minister confirmed the respective assessment and reassessment by joint notice of confirmation dated March 2, 2022. The next communication, filing or action occurred on July 10, 2023. On that date, Ms. Sto Domingo filed an application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.\n[5] Ms. Sto Domingo testified directly and on cross-examination that her life between March 2, 2022 and July 10, 2023 was difficult and confused.\n[6] Her physical and financial health, and that of her family distracted her. Physically, she contracted COVID-19 several times during that period as did her husband. Financially, her tax preparer died in or around May, 2022. As someone unfamiliar with the language and tax matters, assistance was needed, but difficult to access.\n[7] Confusion was the order of the day. After turning to other GLGI subscribers, Ms. Sto Domingo discovered that others too were uncertain and unknowing of where to turn. In short, she did not understand the significance of the notice of confirmation once she re-discovered having received it.\n[8] On cross-examination, Ms. Sto Domingo confirmed she received the notice of confirmation, did not contact the CRA in response, instead tried to seek advice elsewhere in vain and, ultimately, only refocused on the issue once garnishment proceedings were threatened. This caused her to begin paying the tax in December 2023, while seeking this extension.\n[9] In argument, Ms. Sto Domingo asserts the deadline was \u201coverlooked\u201d because of all of these unforeseen and unfortunate contributing factors.\n[10] The Income Tax Act clearly states the conditions under which an extension to file a notice of appeal may be granted once an assessment or reassessment for tax has been confirmed and sent by the CRA. Firstly, subsection 169(1) provides the taxpayer with ninety (90) days to file a notice of appeal with the Court.\n[11] If the taxpayer misses that deadline, there is further relief. Subsection 167(5) provides that a taxpayer may bring an extension application within (1) one year after the expiration of the ninety days initial deadline.\n[12] Those deadlines apply to the facts in this application as follows:\nOccurrence\/Deadline\nApplicable Date of Occurrence\nNotice of Confirmation for 2012 and 2013\nMarch 2, 2022\nNinety (90) Days after confirmation to file notice of appeal: ss. 169(1)\nMay 31, 2022\nOne Year after the 90 day period to file application to extend time to file notice of appeal: ss. 167(5)\nMay 31, 2023\nExtension Application filed by Ms. Sto Domingo with the Tax Court\nJuly 10, 2023\n[13] No excuse exists where a taxpayer fails to act and misses the extension application deadline under subsection 167(5). The final ironclad deadline above relevant in this application is May 31, 2023. Ms. Sto Domingo did not file her application until July 10, 2023. This inflexibility appears, and perhaps rightly has been described as, harsh.\n[14] Lest anyone should think that such a clear redline has come from the bench of relevant courts, critics are directed to the preamble of the section. No less a body than Parliament, itself, marshalled the clearest, evocative language it could:\nS. 167 \u2026\nWhen order to be made\n(5) No order shall be made under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time limited by section 169 for appealing; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by section 169 for appealing the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to appeal,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application,\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted, and\n(iv) there are reasonable grounds for the appeal.\n[emphasis added]\n[15] As such, both the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have emphasized repeatedly that they have no discretion, flexibility or leniency to pry that forged deadline open. That is true no matter how sympathetic, unforeseen or unavoidable the impediments are to filing the extension application. Unfortunately for Ms. Sto Domingo, that holds in this application.\n[16] If the notice of confirmation is sent, as it was in this application, time commences to run. If a taxpayer takes no measureable or meaningful responsive action to file (or even attempt to file), as none occurred in this application, within the combined one year and ninety days, then this Court is powerless to countermand the mandated direction of Parliament. Justice McPhee succinctly reviewed the leading Federal Court of Appeal and Tax Court authorities concerning the clear, unequivocal and fatal nature of the deadlines, no matter how sympathetic the reasons for the omission: Dutka v. HMQ 2020 TCC 21 at paragraphs 18 through 26.\n[17] Given the above, there is no need for the Court to consider any alternative submissions of the Respondent concerning whether there are \u201creasonable grounds for the appeal\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 167(5)(iv).\nConclusion [18] Regrettably, for all these reasons, the application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal is dismissed. There shall be no costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of March 2024.\n\u201cR.S.

Introduction [1] On August 22, 2023, Lark Investments Inc. (Lark or the Appellant) filed a Notice of Motion before this Court pursuant to sections 53 and 65 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (Rules) seeking an order:\n(i) Striking out, without leave to amend, subparagraphs 67 d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k), l) and m) of the Respondent\u2019s Further Amended Reply filed on December 2, 2022;\n(ii) Striking out the Further Amended Reply filed on December 2, 2022 and allowing the appeal; and\n(iii) Awarding costs of this motion.\n[2] The Appellant set out the grounds in the Notice of Motion as follows:\n(i) the alleged abuse is dependent on control by Canadian residents, which is totally inconsistent with the unchallenged and uncontradicted facts admitted by the Respondent, and\n(ii) the rationale for the alleged abuse is based on completely different transactions carried out by different taxpayers, unrelated to the Appellant.\n[3] For the reasons below, the Appellant\u2019s Motion is allowed in part such that subparagraphs 67d) to m) of the Further Amended Reply are struck but with leave to amend. The Respondent\u2019s pleadings are deficient but they are not incurable. The Respondent shall have until May 1, 2024 to file and serve an amended Further Amended Reply. The Appellant shall have until June 3, 2024 to file and serve an answer, if any, to the newly amended Further Amended Reply. The Appellant is entitled to costs of this motion in any event of the cause.\nII. Background Facts and Issue in this Appeal [4] The basic facts concerning Lark\u2019s shareholders and the transactions that led to the reassessment do not appear to be disputed.\n[5] Lark is a holding corporation that has continuously been resident in Canada since its incorporation in 2013 under the Business Corporations Act of Ontario (RSO 1990 c B.16). Prior to July 24, 2015, Sajjad Ebrahim was its sole shareholder and Lark was a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC). In 2015, Lark issued preference shares with voting rights to Mr. Ebrahim\u2019s non-resident children. Shares were not issued to Mr. Ebrahim\u2019s resident son.\n[6] After the corporate reorganization, the non-resident children held 50.89% of the voting rights such that Lark no longer met the statutory definition of a CCPC under the Income Tax Act (RSC 1985, c 1 (5th supp)) (ITA).\n[7] On July 31, 2015, Lark disposed of investment property, realized a capital gain of $118,810,035 and declared a taxable capital gain of $59,405,018 for its 2016 taxation year. On October 15, 2015, Lark declared a dividend of $53,943,700 on its common shares and elected that it be treated as a capital dividend pursuant to subsection 83(2) of the ITA.\n[8] In reassessing the Appellant for its taxation year ended on June 30, 2016, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) imposed tax under section 123.3 and denied the general rate reduction under section 123.4 of the ITA. This resulted in an increase in tax of almost 13 million dollars.\n[9] It bears reminding that a CCPC is subject to a refundable tax on its investment income under section 123.3 of the ITA and is not entitled to the general rate reduction under section 123.4 of the ITA. Conversely, a non-CCPC is not subject to tax under 123.3 and is entitled to the general rate reduction under section 123.4. The non-payment of tax under section 123.3 together with the rate reduction under section 123.4 form the alleged \u201ctax benefit\u201d that is the subject of this appeal.\n[10] Taking the position that there was a misuse of sections 123.3 and 123.4 or an abuse of the ITA read as a whole, the Minister applied the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in section 245 of the ITA to deny the \u201ctax benefit\u201d. Hence, defined broadly, the issue in this appeal is whether GAAR applies to the transactions described above.\nIII. Procedural History [11] In light of the parties\u2019 arguments in this motion to strike, it is useful to provide the procedural history of this matter to date. The procedural steps can be summarized as follows:\n(i) The Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal on August 16, 2021;\n(ii) The Respondent filed its Reply on November 19, 2021;\n(iii) The Responded filed an Amended Reply on February 14, 2022;\n(iv) The parties conducted examinations for discovery on June 9 and 10, 2022;\n(v) During examinations for discovery, the Respondent\u2019s counsel objected to its nominee providing the GAAR Committee documents pertaining to a case involving a factual background that was not dissimilar to that of Lark and which played a role in the decision to apply GAAR without the GAAR Committee performing an analysis in the Lark matter;\n(vi) The Respondent filed a Further Amended Reply on December 2, 2022 (this pleading is the subject of this motion);\n(vii) After the Appellant filed a motion to compel the Respondent to provide the GAAR Committee documents on December 8, 2022, but before it was heard, the Respondent produced four GAAR Committee documents on January 27, 2023;\n(viii) On April 17, 2023, the Appellant conducted further examinations for discovery of the auditor; and\n(ix) On August 22, 2023, the Appellant filed this motion to strike.\nIV. Position of the Parties on the Motion to Strike A. The Appellant\u2019s Position\n[12] The Appellant is seeking an order striking subparagraphs 67 d) to m) (impugned paragraphs, reproduced in Schedule A to these reasons) of the Further Amended Reply without leave to amend. In addition, the Appellant submits that as striking the impugned paragraphs results in a reply that does not comply with section 49 of the Rules, the only appropriate remedy is to strike the Further Amended Reply in its entirety and allow the appeal.\n[13] In the Appellant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s rationale in support of the application of GAAR, control of Lark by Canadian residents, is completely inconsistent with the unchallenged facts, mainly that the majority voting power is held by non-residents (Notice of Motion at paras 22-23). That, according to the Appellant, is a sufficient basis to strike the impugned paragraphs.\n[14] Further, the Appellant submits that the decision to apply GAAR in this matter was made without a referral to the GAAR Committee and the rationale for the application of GAAR to the transactions undertaken by Lark is based on completely different transactions involving a different taxpayer. It is not disputed that the GAAR Committee documents disclosed by the Respondent after the first round of examinations for discovery reveal that the analysis focussed on a transaction that did not involve the issuance of shares to non-residents but rather, focussed on the alleged abuse that resulted from the loss of CCPC status through a corporate migration.\n[15] The Appellant asserts that the rationale in support of the application of GAAR, in the case that is the subject of the GAAR Committee documents, is simply not applicable to the circumstances of this case (see Memorandum G04704, Motion Record at p 223). The Appellant submits that allowing the appeal to proceed, where the Respondent\u2019s position is in no conceivable manner connected to the transaction at issue will prejudice the fair hearing of the appeal and constitutes an abuse of process (Notice of Motion at para 41).\n[16] The Appellant did not make a request under Rule 8 for leave of the Court to bring its motion to strike. However, in opposing the Appellant\u2019s motion to strike, the Respondent referenced section 8 of the Rules, a rule often referred to as the fresh step rule. In addressing the Respondent\u2019s arguments on Rule 8 at the hearing, the Appellant submitted that the GAAR Committee documents disclosed on January 27, 2023 and the further examinations for discovery, the need for which resulted from that disclosure and which took place on April 17, 2023, underlie its motion to strike. Therefore, the motion could not have been brought earlier. In addition, the Appellant argued that there were other exceptions to Rule 8 that were applicable to the circumstances of this case.\n[17] And further, based on a recent decision of this Court in Gilchrist Properties Ltd. v The King (2023 TCC 153), the Appellant took the position that the Court can hear the motion to strike without it having to obtain leave prior to the hearing.\nB. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[18] The Respondent submits that the Appellant cannot bring this motion without leave of the Court pursuant to section 8 of the Rules. The Respondent states that the only amendment to the impugned paragraphs since the initial Reply was filed was to strike the word \u201cactually\u201d and replace it with \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d in paragraph 67g). The Respondent submits that this motion was brought after the expiry of a reasonable time after the Appellant knew or ought to have known of the alleged irregularity.\n[19] The Respondent further observes that the Appellant conducted examinations for discovery after the initial Reply was filed and conducted further examinations for discovery after the Further Amended Reply was filed. Hence, since the Appellant has taken further steps in the proceeding after obtaining knowledge of the irregularity, it cannot bring this motion to strike without leave of the Court.\n[20] Regarding the merits of the motion, the Respondent submits that the Appellant has not met the legal threshold required to strike part or all of a pleading pursuant to subsection 53(1) of the Rules in that it is not plain and obvious that the Reply fails to state a reasonable basis for concluding that the reassessment is correct.\n[21] The Respondent asserts that the grounds in the Further Amended Reply are consistent with the facts set out in the Reply. In support of this position, the Respondent refers to paragraph 67k)i) of the Further Amended Reply which states that \u201c[t]he Transaction may reasonably be considered to have resulted in: i) a misuse of ss. 125(7), 123.3 and 123.4 of the ITA by frustrating and defeating the rationale for these provisions and by allowing for a result which these provisions were not intended\u201d. The Respondent further comments that their nominee confirmed that the non-resident children had de jure control but that at no point, did the Respondent admit that they had de facto control of Lark (Respondent\u2019s written submissions at paras 39 and 40).\n[22] With respect to the Appellant\u2019s submissions on the Minister\u2019s decision to apply GAAR to this case, the Respondent submits that the process by which the reassessment was established is not relevant to its correctness. Further, the Respondent asserts that there is no legislative requirement that the GAAR Committee be consulted before GAAR is applied to a particular situation.\nV. Analysis A. Law Applicable to Striking Pleadings\n[23] As noted earlier, the Appellant seeks to have the impugned paragraphs struck pursuant to section 53 of the Rules, a provision which specifically addresses the striking of pleadings. Subsection 53(1) reads as follows:\n53 (1) The Court may, on its own initiative or on application by a party, strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading or other document with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document,\n(a) may prejudice or delay the fair hearing of the appeal;\n(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;\n(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court; or\n(d) discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal or opposing the appeal.\n53 (1) La Cour peut, de son propre chef ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, radier un acte de proc\u00e9dure ou tout autre document ou en supprimer des passages, en tout ou en partie, avec ou sans autorisation de le modifier parce que l\u2019acte ou le document:\n(a) peut compromettre ou retarder l\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable de l\u2019appel;\n(b) est scandaleux, frivole ou vexatoire;\n(c) constitue un recours abusif \u00e0 la Cour;\n(d) ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucun moyen raisonnable d\u2019appel ou de contestation de l\u2019appel.\n[24] Before reviewing the case law interpreting section 53 of the Rules, it is worth repeating that the purpose of pleadings is \u201cto define the issues in dispute between the parties for the purposes of production, discovery and trial.\u201d (Hillcore Financial Corporation v The King, 2023 TCC 71 at para 12, referring to Zelinski v R, [2002] DTC 1204, [2002] 1 CTC 2422 at para 4 [Zelinski], aff\u2019d 2002 FCA 330; Beima v The Queen, 2016 FCA 205 at para 17 and Husky Oil Operations Limited v The Queen, 2019 TCC 136 at para 11.) The Appellant argues that in GAAR cases, where the Respondent bears the onus on some elements of the test, there should be increased scrutiny on how the Respondent has defined and addressed the issues. Counsel for the Appellant stated \u201cthe reply should clearly, cogently, precisely lay out what the Crown\u2019s position is\u201d (Transcript of the hearing at p 47 [Transcript]). And, in their view, failure to do so results in prejudice to the Appellant.\n[25] The courts have consistently asserted that the test for striking a pleading is a stringent one. In the oft-quoted decision of this Court in Sentinel Hill Productions (1999) Corporation v The Queen, (2007 TCC 742 [Sentinel]), Chief Justice Bowman (as he then was) summarized the well-established principles applicable to a motion to strike under section 53 of the Rules as follows:\n[4] ... There are many cases in which the matter has been considered both in this court and the Federal Court of Appeal. It is not necessary to quote from them all as the principles are well established.\n(a) The facts as alleged in the impugned pleading must be taken as true subject to the limitations stated in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. Canada, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at 455. It is not open to a party attacking a pleading under Rule 53 to challenge assertions of fact.\n(b) To strike out a pleading or part of a pleading under Rule 53 it must be plain and obvious that the position has no hope of succeeding. The test is a stringent one and the power to strike out a pleading must be exercised with great care.\n(c) A motions judge should avoid usurping the function of the trial judge in making determinations of fact or relevancy. Such matters should be left to the judge who hears the evidence.\n[26] In Hillcore, supra, Justice Lafleur provides the following very useful summary of the relevant case law regarding the principles applicable to the determination of a motion to strike pleadings or part thereof:\n[24] The test to be applied for the striking out of pleadings or parts of pleadings is whether it is plain and obvious that it discloses no reasonable claim (Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, at para 3).\n[25] In the context of a motion to strike a reply in an income tax appeal, the motion will be granted only if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts as pleaded in the reply are true, that the reply fails to state a reasonable basis for concluding that the reassessment under appeal is correct (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. R, 2013 FCA 122 [CIBC, FCA], at para 7).\n[26] More recently, the Federal Court of Appeal in Ereiser v. Canada, 2013 FCA 20, reviewed those principles:\n[17] There is no dispute as to the test for striking pleadings. It was recently restated by Chief Justice McLachlin, writing for the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45 at paragraph 17:\n... A claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action: Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 15; Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 980. Another way of putting the test is that the claim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of success exists, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial: see, generally, Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83; Odhavji Estate; Hunt; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735.\n\u2026\n[35] The Court may grant all necessary amendment or relief to secure the just determination of the real matters in dispute. To strike a pleading without leave to amend, the defect must be incurable by amendment (see Simon, at para 8). Furthermore, the Federal Court determined that for a claim to be struck without leave to amend, there must not be a \u201cscintilla\u201d of a legitimate cause for action (Riabko v. R, [1999] FCJ No 1289, 173 FTR 239 [Riabko], at para 8).\n[36] When an appellant makes a motion to strike a reply, it has the burden of showing that \u201cit would be impossible for the Respondent to amend to support the reassessment\u201d (see Mont-Bruno C. C. Inc. v. R, 2018 TCC 105, at para 29).\n[37] This burden is a heavy one. As stated by this Court in Zelinski, \u201c[a]mendments to pleadings should generally be permitted, so long as that can be done without causing prejudice to the opposing party that cannot be compensated by an award of costs or other terms, as the purpose of the Rules is to ensure, so far as possible, a fair trial of the real issues in dispute between the parties\u201d (at para 4).\n[27] To this summary, I would add the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s recent decision in Ebert v The King (2024 FCA 27 at para 6) wherein the Court reiterates that \u201cthe threshold for striking out pleadings is whether it is \u2018plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action\u2019\u201d.\n[28] It should be clear from the above jurisprudential pronouncements that to strike a pleading or part thereof, it must be plain and obvious that there is no reasonable cause of action, that the action has no hope of succeeding, that it has not a scintilla of a legitimate cause of action, that is has no reasonable basis for concluding that the reassessment is correct. To strike a pleading without leave to amend, the defect must be incurable by amendment. The amendment should be allowed if it can be done without causing prejudice that cannot be compensated by an award of costs. The burden on the party making the motion is a heavy one. These are the principles I will keep in mind in considering the merits of this motion.\nB. Striking the Impugned Paragraphs\n[29] The Appellant acknowledges that the threshold for striking a pleading is stringent. The Appellant argues that they meet this heavy burden, including the burden to justify striking out the impugned paragraphs without leave to amend and further, striking out the entire Further Amended Reply and allowing the appeal. I do not agree.\n[30] I hasten to add that the Respondent\u2019s pleading is poor in that it requires a certain amount of reading between the lines so to speak but I find that the deficiencies are not incurable.\n[31] It is useful at this point to review some of the information that was revealed by the GAAR Committee documents. It appears that at some point during the audit stage, the auditor proposed to assess Lark as if it was a CCPC on the basis that the issuance of preference shares did not in fact lead to control by the non-residents as defined in subsection 125(7) of the ITA and further, that the father, Sajjad Ebrahim, a resident of Canada, maintained de facto control of Lark. This was referred to by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as the \u201ctechnical position\u201d (see Memo dated January 26, 2021, from Ching Yu to Dominic Laroche, Motion Record at pp 187-192 and in particular at p 192). The auditor also wrote that should it be determined that the issuance of the preferred shares resulted in control of Lark by non-residents, it was their position that GAAR applied (see Motion Record at p 192).\n[32] In a subsequent memo, the Tax Avoidance Division states that it continues to support the application of GAAR but recommends not pursuing the application of the technical position, later adding more forcefully that the GAAR position should me maintained as the only assessing position (Memo dated February 3, 2021 from Laurent Richer to Ching Yu, Motion Record at p 207). This, in the Tax Avoidance Division\u2019s view, would resolve the issue created by the assumption that an acquisition of control did not occur for the purposes of the technical position and an assumption that it did occur for the purposes of the GAAR position, positions that are difficult to reconcile (Motion Record at p 210). In reassessing Lark, the Minister applied GAAR.\n[33] The Appellant points out that during the second round of examinations for discovery, the auditor confirmed that Lark was controlled by a Canadian resident before the issuance of the preferred shares but after the issuance of the preferred shares, it was not.\n[34] The Appellant submits that the above-referenced documents show that the Minister had abandoned the technical position in favour of applying GAAR but that the Respondent is now, at this late stage of the proceeding, arguing that the abuse comes from losing de jure control but maintaining de facto control in Canada (Respondent\u2019s Written Submissions at para 37; T p 35). I note that the Respondent admitted, at paragraph 16 of the Further Amended Reply, that the Minister did not pursue the position that Lark was a CCPC under subsection 125(7) of the ITA.\n[35] In the Appellant\u2019s view, this position is flawed, not only because this argument was set aside at the audit stage but also because it engages sections 256(5.1) and 256(5.11) of the ITA and the Further Amended Reply is silent on both counts.\n[36] The Appellant argues that the CRA set aside the de facto control argument and analysis and now wants to argue de facto control, In addition, counsel for the Appellant submitted that he had no grounds to cross-examine on de facto control once the technical position was dropped. At the hearing, counsel for the Appellant stated the following (Transcript at pp 41 and 108-109):\n\u2026 de jure control was with a non-resident, and there's absolutely no focus on de facto control. The de facto control analysis and the factual matrix having to do with de facto control is set aside, not in passing, it's -- the decision is made at headquarters. The decision is made at headquarters.\nWe are not pursuing the de facto control element. We are not proving de facto control. It's a decision that is made by headquarters, now, five days before the hearing of the motion, the minister's contention is, you know what? It's been -- it's always been the case. We wanted to argue de facto control all along.\nThey ignored the fact that it was set aside by headquarters. They ignored the fact that 256(5.1) was not mentioned at paragraph 66 of their reply. They ignored the fact that 256(5.1) is not part of the object, spirit, and purpose that the minister has to disclose and prove. They amend the reply twice. They never disclose it. Five days before the motion, they announce that they're going to argue de facto control. They're not seeking an amendment.\n[\u2026]\nAnd the technical position -- there was no central issue. De facto control was not the central issue of the technical position. It was the sole issue. So when I cross-examined the auditor and I asked whether the technical position is dropped, and she says, \u201cYes, the technical position is dropped,\u201d I have no ground to cross-examine on de facto control. I have no ground to explore influence. I have no ground to explore the exceptions to de facto control in 256(5.1). I am simply not allowed to question a CRA nominee on an issue that is no longer debated.\n[37] The Appellant argues that if the Respondent wants to change the basis of its reassessment, which it is entitled to do under subsection 152(9) of the ITA, they would have to make a request to amend their reply. That is not what the Respondent has done. The Appellant cites Aeronautic Development Corporation v The Queen (2017 TCC 39 [Aeronautic]) in support of its position. I note that in Aeronautic, the Respondent advised the Appellant that it intended to pursue a new argument two weeks before the hearing. Justice Hogan refused to consider the new argument because the Respondent had failed to amend her Reply in accordance with the rules of procedure (Aeronautic at para 32). In the present appeal, the proceeding is not yet at the hearing stage and further, in responding to the Appellant\u2019s motion, the Respondent is seeking leave to amend their reply should the Court find that the impugned paragraphs ought to be struck.\n[38] In Polarsat v The King (2023 FCA 247 at para 8 [Polarsat]), the Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the pronouncements of this Court and stated that subsection 152(9) \u201callows the respondent, subject to certain limitations, to advance an alternative argument in support of an assessment \u2018[a]t any time after the normal reassessment period.\u2019\u201d The Federal Court of Appeal also agreed that the Respondent \u201cshould not be precluded from adding an alternative argument in a reply because some officers of the CRA, no matter how important they are, have decided not to do so in the pre-trial steps\u201d (Polarsat at para 10).\n[39] The Respondent\u2019s Further Amended Reply is clear that after the issuance of the preference shares, Lark was no longer a CCPC. Paragraph 55 a) of the Further Amended Reply reads as follows: \u201c[t]he Appellant was a private corporation, within the meaning of s. 89(1) of the ITA, but it was no longer a CCPC.\u201d Hence, it cannot be said that the Respondent is now reviving the argument that Lark is a CCPC. What is not explicit in the Further Amended Reply is exactly what the Respondent is arguing, which according to their submissions at the hearing and assuming I have understood them correctly, is as follows: although Lark is no longer a CCPC because the non-resident children have de jure control, there is abuse because de facto control is maintained in Canada. And in the Appellant\u2019s view, the failure to disclose this position is an abuse of process.\n[40] The Appellant further argues that the Minister\u2019s basis for the reassessment is grounded in a decision to apply the analysis that the GAAR Committee applied in another case they described as \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to the present case. In the Appellant\u2019s view, the rationale is completely disconnected from the present case and this represents the absence of a proper abuse analysis applicable to Lark justifying striking the pleadings (Transcript at p 13).\n[41] Clearly, the memoranda sent to the GAAR Committee regarding the \u201cnon-dissimilar\u201d case addressed alleged abuse resulting from the loss of CCPC status through a continuance. And clearly, those are not Lark\u2019s circumstances (Memorandum G04704 dated August 21, 2020, Motion Record at p 223; Memorandum dated May 19, 2020, Motion Record at p 230). However, I think it is fair to say the GAAR Committee comments in those memoranda spoke to the specific circumstances of the non-dissimilar case such that, as asserted by the Respondent, it cannot be said that the Minister might not take a different position regarding the application of GAAR to other continuances or to other cases where there is a change in CCPC status because non-residents acquire control of a corporation.\n[42] And further, I am of the view that it was open to the Minister to assert that while there is no continuance in the Appellant\u2019s case, there was a change in CCPC status and it was done to avoid the application of sections 123.3 and 123.4 and that resulted in the alleged abuse. That is a question for the trial judge but nonetheless it is a position that the Respondent is entitled to take. But the Respondent\u2019s position must be clearly set out in the Reply.\n[43] Although the Appellant acknowledged that the GAAR Committee is not a statutory committee but rather an advisory committee, the Appellant appears to complain that there was no GAAR analysis conducted by the GAAR Committee specifically for Lark\u2019s case. Counsel submitted that the analysis in the other case was arguably decisive in the decision to reassess Lark and it reveals that there was no proper abuse analysis applicable to the Appellant.\n[44] Courts have consistently held that the issue in an appeal before this Court is the validity of the assessment and not the process by which it was established and further, the conduct of CRA officials is irrelevant to the determination of the correctness of an assessment (see Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd. v The Queen, 2004 FCA 403 at para 8; Ereiser v The Queen, 2013 FCA 20 at para 31).\n[45] Regarding more specifically the issue of referral to the GAAR Committee, in Collins & Aikman Canada Inc. v The Queen (2009 TCC 299 at para 33), Justice Boyle commented that he accorded \u201clittle or no weight, relevance or significance to the fact that the Crown did not go back to the GAAR Committee on the most important aspect of the determinations, assessments and appeals\u201d. He offered his musings on the effect of the government\u2019s failure to communicate with the GAAR Committee but asserted that this did not in any way affect his analysis of the issues in the case. I adopt Justice Boyle\u2019s view that there is no requirement that the Minister consult the GAAR Committee. I further find that the fact that the Minister decided to apply GAAR because it found the circumstances of Lark to be similar, or not dissimilar, to another case in which a GAAR analysis was conducted is irrelevant to whether the Minister was justified in applying GAAR in reassessing Lark.\n[46] With this background in mind, the Appellant made submissions on each of the grounds justifying the striking of pleadings pursuant to paragraphs 53(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules.\n[47] Firstly, relying on paragraph 53(1)(a) of the Rules, the Appellant argued that the pleading may delay the fair hearing of this matter because the abuse analysis is irrelevant to the facts of this case. The Appellant added that the failure to refer to de facto control may prejudice the fair hearing of the appeal. Counsel for the Appellant stated (Transcript at p 53):\nFirst is -- well, if the Crown doesn\u2019t argue what's in its reply, because it's unrelated, what are they going to argue at trial?\nWell, we don\u2019t know, and we might only know during trial. That may lead to an adjournment, that may lead us to -- that may lead to the need to bring in counter-evidence that may lead to the need for additional witnesses, and additional representations. And that shouldn't be the case.\nWhy? Because the issues and how we deal with the issues at trial should have -- it should all have been done as part of the pre-trial process.\nAnd when we looked through the prism of this new element of de facto control, which is buried in paragraph 40 of the written reps, well, now that all the pre-trial steps have been done, there is no doubt that it's going to delay the fair hearing of the appeal.\n[48] It has been suggested that a pleading may delay the fair hearing of an appeal if it is plain and obvious that the pleading is irrelevant to the issues to be resolved (see Hillcore, supra at para 27). I find that it cannot be said that the reasons relied on in the Further Amended Reply are irrelevant to the issues. Having said this, the pleading as is fails to clearly articulate the Respondent\u2019s position. The Respondent submits that their position is that the transaction with the surrounding facts is what resulted in the misuse of the provisions, given their object, spirit and purpose (Transcript at p 96). The Respondent acknowledged that the pleading does not explicitly refer to de facto control and added that if that is unclear to the Appellant, it is easily curable.\n[49] Secondly, the Appellant submits that a pleading is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious pursuant to paragraph 53(1)(b) of the Rules when \u201cit was so deficient that the defendant could not have known how to answer the claim. As well the Court would be unable to regulate or manage the proceeding\u201d (Hillcore, supra at para 29, referring to Simon v Canada, 2011 FCA 6 at para 9). The Appellant submits it does not know how to answer the Respondent\u2019s claim because the rationale does not apply to Lark\u2019s situation. I find that the Further Amended Reply, and more specifically the impugned paragraphs, are not scandalous, frivolous or vexatious. The pleading lacks specificity on the Respondent\u2019s position but I am persuaded that this is not what paragraph 53(1)(b) was meant to address. In Sentinel, supra at paragraph 11, Chief Justice Bowman, as he then was, wrote as follows:\nHowever much jurisprudence may surround the words \u201cscandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or abuse of the process of the Court\u201d, they are nonetheless strong, emotionally charged and derogatory expressions denoting pleading that is patently and flagrantly without merit. Their application should be reserved for the plainest and most egregiously senseless assertions.\nNothing in the Respondent\u2019s Further Amended Reply rises to the level of \u201cplainest and most egregiously senseless assertions.\u201d\n[50] Thirdly, relying on paragraph 53(1)(c) of the Rules, the Appellant submits that \u201cthe lack of transparency, the absence of full and frank disclosure, \u2026 and seeing this discrepancy with \u2026 the admissions made by the auditor, it is simply an abuse of process for the Crown not to disclose its position. And in the context of a GAAR appeal, I think the abuse is more blatant\u201d (Transcript at p 55). The Appellant relied on this Court\u2019s findings in Adboss, Ltd. v The King (2022 TCC 125 at para 37 [Adboss TCC], aff\u2019d 2023 FCA 201 [Adboss FCA]) wherein Justice Lafleur stated as follows:\n[37] Hence, because the Appellant will have to speculate as to the facts underlying the conclusion of mixed fact and law of the Minister that the \u201ccontrolling mind and management\u201d of Lowfroc was in Canada, and because the Appellant therefore cannot be properly prepared for and proceed with discoveries, this will prejudice or delay the fair prosecution of the appeal and constitutes an abuse of the Court\u2019s process.\n[51] In confirming this Court\u2019s decision in Adboss TCC, the Federal Court of Appeal referred to its recent decision in Canada v Preston (2023 FCA 178 [Preston]) and reiterated its view that, in certain circumstances, deficient pleadings may be allowed to stand, including when letting the deficient pleadings stand better serves the trial process (Adboss FCA at para 18).\n[52] I reiterate that the Appellant is requesting that the impugned paragraphs be struck without leave to amend because, in their view, the defect is incurable. The Appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he documents disclosed and the transcripts of the discoveries show that the only basis to sustain the abuse analysis (corporate migration to a foreign jurisdiction) is flawed and inconsistent with the underlying facts. There is no alternative position, rationale or realistic argument available to the Respondent\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Written Submissions at para 77). With respect, I find this argument untenable in that it is grounded in the Appellant\u2019s view that in light of the GAAR Committee documents, the Respondent\u2019s application of GAAR to Lark is rooted in the position that the loss of CCPC status following a continuance was abusive. I do not find that to be the case. My view is that the Respondent simply concluded that the loss of CCPC status (by continuance in the not dissimilar case and by issuance of preference shares in Lark\u2019s case) are both alleged to be an abuse of the relevant provisions of the ITA.\n[53] Now, I ask, why are we here? What led to this motion to strike by the Appellant? And the simple answer is: the Respondent\u2019s pleading is poor. The Respondent does not clearly indicate what leads to the submission that there is abuse in this case. In reading the grounds relied on by the Respondent in their Further Amended Reply, I find that the very general statements in paragraphs 67d) to j) read more like notes from a theoretical discussion of the notion of integration and the anti-deferral regime one would find in a law school tax class. I am not suggesting those are irrelevant. On the contrary.\n[54] In the context of a GAAR analysis, the burden is on the Minister to establish that the avoidance transaction, if any, is abusive. In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v Canada (2005 SCC 54 at para 55), the Supreme Court of Canada found that the first step of the analytical approach applicable to subsection 245(4) requires a court to determine the object, the spirit and purpose of the provisions of the ITA which are relied on for the tax benefit. Hence, the Respondent cannot be faulted for dedicating several paragraphs of the Reply to put forth their view of the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions, sections 123.3 and 123.4 of the ITA.\n[55] Having said this, if one puts the grounds that relate to the notion of integration, the definition of CCPC and the object, purpose and spirit of the relevant provisions aside for a moment, there is very little left. When I put this to the Respondent\u2019s counsel at the hearing and asked him where I could find their position on the alleged abuse in this case, he simply referred me to subparagraph 67k) and added that the \u201ctransaction\u201d with the surrounding facts is what resulted in the misuse of the provisions, given what the object, spirit, and purpose is (Transcript at p 96). It is useful to refer specifically to subparagraph 67k) which reads as follows:\nk) The Transaction may reasonably be considered to have resulted in:\ni) a misuse of ss. 125(7), 123.3 and 123.4 of the ITA by frustrating and defeating the rationale for this provision and by allowing for a result for which these provisions were not intended, and\nii) an abuse having regard to the ITA read as a whole.\n[56] In my view, the Appellant, the Court and perhaps any interested reader of the Further Amended Reply should be able to know why, in light of the notion of integration and in light of the object, spirit and purpose of sections 123.3 and 123.4, the Respondent alleges that the transaction may reasonably be considered to have resulted in misuse or abuse. I do not see that clearly set out. That is what I meant when I stated earlier that one has to read between the lines, and by looking at the facts assumed, try to determine what exactly the Respondent is arguing. Why is the Respondent\u2019s position not explicitly set out in the pleading? Why is there no mention of de facto control?\n[57] When reviewing the assumptions of fact, it is clear that the Respondent assumed that Lark was a CCPC until it issued preference shares to the non-resident children. It is also clear that the Respondent assumed that Lark was no longer a CCPC after it issued the preference shares (Further Amended Reply at paras 54 and 55). In addition, the Respondent has set out their assumptions regarding who was responsible for decision-making before and after the issuance of the preference shares (Further Amended Reply at paras 35 and 36) as well as what the holders of the different categories of shares were entitled to (Further Amended Reply at paras 41 to 45). Hence, it appears that the factual underpinnings of the Respondent\u2019s argument that the transaction may have resulted in abuse are set out in the Further Amended Reply. At the risk of repeating myself, I would say that the interested reader should not have to trace their own path between the factual underpinnings and paragraph 67k) to know exactly what the Respondent\u2019s position is as to why there is abuse or misuse in this case.\n[58] I must say I find it difficult to accept that the Appellant could have been taken by surprise by the Respondent\u2019s assertion in their written submissions that the non-resident children did not have de facto control of Lark (Respondent\u2019s Written Submissions at para 37). However, I find that the Appellant was entitled to a pleading that clearly set out the Respondent\u2019s position. That is not what can be said of the Further Amended Reply. It is deficient. But it is deficient more for what it does not state than what it does state.\n[59] Counsel for the Respondent looked to subparagraph 67k) of the Further Amended Reply to support their argument that their position is set out in the pleading, because when using the word transaction, \u201cwhat\u2019s being referred to are the circumstances. The transaction in these circumstances, with these facts, the facts of this case have resulted in a misuse of the provisions listed\u201d (Transcript at pp 87-88). With respect, I find that subparagraph 67k) of the Further Amended Reply does not clearly set out the Respondent\u2019s position.\n[60] I find that part of the pleading in this case may prejudice the fair hearing of the appeal and is an abuse of process. I so find because the Respondent must state the reasons they intend to rely on as required by paragraph 49(1)(h) of the Rules. They did not, at least certainly not clearly and without the Appellant having to forge its own path to get there.\n[61] In my view, it is not up to the Court to tell the Respondent how to \u201cfix\u201d their pleading. I have come to the conclusion that the most appropriate way forward is to strike the impugned paragraphs but with leave to amend. Leaving the pleading as is would not better serve the trial process (Preston, supra). The pleading is deficient but it is not incurable. I agree with the statement made in Mont-Bruno C.C. Inc. v The Queen (2018 TCC 105 at para 18), that \u201cfor a pleading to be struck without leave to amend, the defect in the pleading must be one that is not curable by amendment\u201d.\n[62] In its recent decision in Polarsat Inc. v The King (2023 FCA 247 at para 3), the Federal Court of Appeal asserted that \u201cit is trite \u2026 that an amendment to a pleading should be allowed if it (i) assists the tribunal in determining the real question in controversy, (ii) does not result in an injustice to the other party not compensable by costs and (iii) serves the interests of justice\u201d. I find that all three of these elements are met in this case. I further note that in The Queen v Pomeroy Acquireco Ltd. (2021 FCA 187 at para 4), the Federal Court of Appeal specified that such an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action.\nC. The Fresh Step Rule\n8. A motion to attack a proceeding or a step, document or direction in a proceeding for irregularity shall not be made,\na) after the expiry of a reasonable time after the moving party knows or ought reasonably to have known of the irregularity, or\nb) if the moving party has taken any further step in the proceeding after obtaining knowledge of the irregularity, except with leave of the Court.\n8.

The rule is based on the view that if a party pleads over to a pleading, it implies a waiver of any irregularity that might have been attacked\u201d.\n[64] The Respondent stated that the Appellant brings this motion to strike after they have twice amended the reply and conducted two rounds of discovery. The Respondent suggests that the primary ground for the Appellant\u2019s motion refers to facts that have been in their pleading since the initial reply was filed. Hence, the motion is too late.\n[65] In response, the Appellant submits that the triggering point for its motion to strike is the April 17, 2023 re-examination for discovery which followed the disclosure of the GAAR Committee documents on January 27, 2023. It bears repeating that Appellant moved to strike the impugned paragraphs on the basis that (i) the alleged abuse is dependent on control by Canadian residents, which is totally inconsistent with the unchallenged and uncontradicted facts admitted by the Respondent, and (ii) the rationale for the alleged abuse is based on completely different transactions carried out by different taxpayers, unrelated to the Appellant. It is true that almost the entirety of the impugned provisions were in the initial reply or at least in the first amended reply. However, I find that the grounds for the motion, and in particular the second, came to the forefront after the GAAR Committee documents were disclosed such that it cannot be said that more than a reasonable amount of time has passed after the Appellant knew of the irregularities in the Further Amended Reply as provided by paragraph 8(a) of the Rules.\n[66] The Respondent further submits that the Appellant is restricted in bringing this motion by paragraph 8(b) of the Rules which provides that if a party takes fresh steps after obtaining knowledge of the irregularity, it implies a waiver of the irregularity they might otherwise have been able to attack (see Chad v The Queen, 2021 TCC 45 at para 16, referring to Kossow v The Queen, 2008 TCC 422 at para 21). In light of my finding above regarding the timing of the obtaining of the information that grounds the motion, the Appellant is not caught by this restriction.\n[67] I wish to comment on the inclusion of the term \u201cirregularity\u201d in both paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b) of the Rules. The Appellant argued that it was attacking more than an irregularity, that their motion to strike was an attack of the whole appeal itself. I adopt the comments made by A.C.J. Bowman, as he then was, in Imperial Oil Ltd. v The Queen (2003 TCC 46 at para 20) wherein he stated that allegations that the appeals are frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process is hardly an attack on an irregularity.\n[68] In the exercise of my discretion, I conclude that the Appellant\u2019s motion does not offend paragraphs 8(a) and (b) of the Rules and the Appellant is therefore not barred from bringing its motion to strike without leave of the Court.\nVI. Conclusion [69] For all the reasons above, the Appellant\u2019s motion to strike is granted in part. I find that the Appellant does not meet the stringent test to justify striking the Further Amended Reply in its entirety and allowing the appeal. This is not a case where there is no prospect of success, where the defect is incurable by amendment, or where there is not a scintilla of a legitimate cause of action. It is a case where the pleading is deficient but not incurable. Therefore, subparagraphs 67d) to m) of the Reply are struck with leave to amend. The Respondent shall have until May 1, 2024 to serve and file an amended Further Amended Reply. The Appellant shall have until June 3, 2024 to serve and file an answer, if any, to the newly amended Further Amended Reply.\n[70] The Appellant is entitled to costs of this motion in any event of the cause. The parties shall have 30 days from the date of this Order to reach an agreement on costs for this Motion and to so advise the Court, failing which the Appellant shall have a further 20 days to serve and file written submissions on costs and the Respondent shall have a further 20 days to serve and file a written response.

The Minister properly applied the GAAR under s. 245 of the ITA because:\n\u2026\nd) The general scheme of the ITA includes:\ni) ensuring integration; i.e., combined corporate and personal tax paid on income earned through a corporation should be equal to the tax that would have been paid on that income had it been earned directly by the Canadian-resident individual, and\nii) preventing tax deferral where a private corporation earns passive investment income and does not distribute this income to its individual shareholders who are residents of Canada.\ne) The definition of \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation\u201d in s. 125(7), s. 123.3 and s. 123.4, particularly the \u201cfull rate taxable income\u201d definition in s.\n123.4(1), of the ITA are part of this scheme.\nf) Pursuant to the definition of \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation\u201d in s. 125(7), a private corporation that is a Canadian corporation is a CCPC if, among other things, it is not controlled by one or more non-resident persons.\ng) The object, spirit and purpose of the definition of \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation\u201d is to ensure that private corporations actually directly or indirectly controlled by Canadian residents are subject to the anti-deferral regime applicable to CCPCs.\nh) The object, spirit and purpose of s. 123.3 is to prevent deferral of tax on investment income earned by a private corporation controlled directly or indirectly in any matter whatever by a Canadian resident.\ni) Section 123.4 provides corporations with a deduction in computing tax payable of 13% (called the \u201cgeneral rate reduction percentage\u201d) of their \u201cfull-rate taxable income for the year\u201d. Full-rate taxable income does not include, among other things, the aggregate investment income, within the meaning of s. 129(4), of a CCPC.\nj) The object, spirit and purpose of s. 123.4 is:\ni) to exclude CCPC investment income from the general rate reduction available under that section because such income already benefits from a preferential corporate tax rate if the dividend refund provisions under s. 129 of the ITA are taken into account, and\nii) to prevent Canadian-resident individual shareholders from benefiting from a tax deferral on passive income earned through a private corporation which they control directly or indirectly in any manner whatever and which they would not benefit from had they earned this income directly.\nk) The Transaction may reasonably be considered to have resulted in:\ni) a misuse of ss. 125(7), 123.3 and 123.4 of the 1TA by frustrating and defeating the rationale for these provision and by allowing for a result for which these provisions were not intended, and\nii) an abuse having regard to the ITA read as a whole.\nl) Therefore, s. 245(2) requires a determination of the tax consequences that are reasonable in the circumstances to deny the Tax Benefits.\nm) These tax consequences are specifically to:\ni) impose s. 123.3 tax of $5,221,176, and\nii) deny the general rate reduction under s. 123.4 of $7,722,652.11.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 30\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2021-2037(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nLARK INVESTMENTS INC.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 31\nDate: 20240312\nDocket: 2019-2603(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nSUNCOR ENERGY INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\n[1] This appeal relates to the application of the available-for-use rules contained in subsections 13(26) to 13(32) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, C.1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d). These rules provide that a taxpayer may not add the cost of a depreciable capital property to the relevant undepreciated capital cost (\u201cUCC\u201d) pool until the property is considered, under the Act, to have become available for use. A taxpayer cannot claim capital cost allowance (\u201cCCA\u201d) in respect of the property until the cost of the property is added to the UCC pool.\n[2] The specific issue in this appeal is whether the deeming rule in subsection 13(31) creates a notional taxation year in the situation where a taxpayer is deemed to have acquired depreciable capital property at a time when the taxpayer was not yet in existence. The answer to this question determines the point in time at which the property is considered, for the purposes of subsection 13(26), to be available for use under the so-called two-year rolling start rule in paragraph 13(27)(b).\nSummary of Facts\n[3] The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts. There were no witnesses. The Agreed Statement of Facts is attached as Appendix A to these reasons for judgment.\n[4] The facts may be summarized as follows:\n-The Appellant is an integrated energy company that operates oil sands, natural gas, refining and marketing businesses.\n-The Appellant\u2019s oil sands business includes the upgrading and processing of crude bitumen and other related products.\n-During the relevant period, the Appellant had a December 31 year-end.\n-The Millennium Coker Unit was part of the Millennium mine that was built to increase oil sands production.\n-In 2003, the Appellant began the Millennium Coker Unit project (the \u201cMCU Project\u201d), whose purpose was to add a third set of cokers to the upgrader associated with the Millennium Coker Unit as well as make modifications to other upgrader components.\n-In January 2005, the Appellant incurred expenses in the amount of $34,368,000 to acquire, for the MCU Project, depreciable property described in Class 41 of Schedule II of the Income Tax Regulations, C.R.C., r. 945 (the \u201cMCU Depreciable Properties\u201d).\n-Suncor Energy Oil Sands Inc. (the \u201cSubsidiary\u201d) was incorporated on January 19, 2005 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Appellant.\n-On February 1, 2005, the Suncor Energy Oil Sands Limited Partnership (the \u201cLimited Partnership\u201d) was formed and registered as a limited partnership, with the Appellant as the general partner and the Subsidiary as the limited partner. The Appellant held a 99.9% interest in the Limited Partnership and the Subsidiary held a 0.1% interest.\n-The Appellant and the Limited Partnership were not dealing at arm\u2019s length for purposes of the Act.\n-The fiscal period of the Limited Partnership ended on January 31.\n-The net income of the Limited Partnership was allocated at the end of its fiscal year in proportion to each partner\u2019s partnership interest.\n-On January 1, 2006, the Appellant contributed the MCU Depreciable Properties (together with other assets comprising its oil sands business) to the Limited Partnership.\n-The Appellant and the Limited Partnership filed a joint election pursuant to subsection 97(2) with an elected amount of $823,241,000 in respect of depreciable property included in Class 41 (which included $34,368,000 relating to the MCU Depreciable Properties). The elected amount was equal to the fair market value of such properties.\n[5] For CCA purposes, the Limited Partnership added $34,368,000 to its Class 41 UCC balance on the basis that the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use immediately after the beginning of the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.[1] The Limited Partnership then deducted the related CCA when computing its net income for its fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.\n[6] The Limited Partnership allocated 99.9% of its income for its fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007 to the Appellant.\n[7] The Minister reassessed the Appellant\u2019s 2007 taxation year on the basis that the MCU Depreciable Properties were not available for use at any time during the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007. The reassessment disallowed the addition of $34,368,000 to the Limited Partnership\u2019s UCC balance and the related CCA deduction. This resulted in an increase in the income of the Limited Partnership and, therefore, in the amount of income allocated to the Appellant in respect of the Limited Partnership\u2019s fiscal period ending on January 31, 2007.\nThe Law and the Issue\n[8] Paragraph 18(1)(b) prohibits the deduction of an outlay of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation when calculating the income of a taxpayer from a business, except as expressly permitted under the Act.\n[9] Paragraph 20(1)(a) and the related regulations allow a taxpayer to deduct CCA in respect of the UCC of its depreciable capital assets. It appears from paragraphs 6 and 16 of the Agreed Statement of Facts that the MCU Depreciable Properties are Class 41 properties with a CCA rate of 25%.\n[10] Section 13 contains a number of rules for determining the UCC of a taxpayer\u2019s depreciable capital assets. The relevant rule for purposes of this appeal is the so-called available-for-use rule contained in subsections 13(26) to (32)\u2014in particular, the rules contained in subsections 13(26), 13(27) and 13(31).\n[11] Subsection 13(26) sets out the available-for-use rule. It provides that a taxpayer cannot add an amount to the UCC of depreciable property of a prescribed class, in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class, until the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer. The subsection reads as follows:\n13(26) In applying the definition \u201cundepreciated capital cost\u201d in subsection (21) for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a) and any regulations made for the purpose of that paragraph, in computing a taxpayer's income for a taxation year from a business or property, no amount shall be included in calculating the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of a prescribed class in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class (other than property that is a certified production, as defined by regulations made for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a)) before the time the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer.\n[12] As a result of subsection 13(26), the Limited Partnership was not entitled to add the $34,368,000 cost of the MCU Depreciable Properties to its Class 41 UCC balance until such time as the properties became available for use by the Limited Partnership.\n[13] Subsection 13(27) contains a number of rules for determining when a depreciable property, other than a building, is considered to have become available for use. The provision provides that the property is available for use at the earliest of a number of times.\n[14] The general rule, contained in paragraph 13(27)(a), states that a property is available for use at the time the property is first used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income. Paragraphs (b) through (k) of subsection 13(27) provide rules that may result in the property becoming available for use before it is first used to earn income. The complete provision is attached as Appendix B.\n[15] The relevant portions of the subsection, for purposes of this appeal, are paragraphs 13(27)(a) and (b), which read as follows:\n13(27) For the purposes of subsection (26) and subject to subsection (29), property (other than a building or part thereof) acquired by a taxpayer shall be considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer at the earliest of\n(a) the time the property is first used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income,\n(b) the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the taxpayer that begins more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the taxpayer in which the property was acquired by the taxpayer,\n[16] Under paragraph 13(27)(b), the property will be considered to have become available for use immediately after the beginning of the second taxation year after the taxation year in which the taxpayer acquired the property. Further, the intervening taxation year must be a full taxation year, at least 357 days long. This is referred to as the two-year rolling start rule.\n[17] I have assumed, on the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts, that the Limited Partnership did not use the MCU Depreciable Properties for the purpose of earning income during the relevant periods. It appears that the Appellant did not complete the MCU Project until some future date.\n[18] On the basis of this assumption, paragraph 13(27)(b) determined when the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use by the Limited Partnership for the purposes of subsection 13(26). Therefore, under the two-year rolling start rule, the Limited Partnership was not entitled to claim CCA in respect of the MCU Depreciable Properties until the time that was immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year in which the MCU Depreciable Properties were acquired by the Limited Partnership.\n[19] As a question of fact, the Limited Partnership acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties on January 1, 2006. The taxation year of actual acquisition ended on January 31, 2006.\n[20] The first taxation year that began more than 357 days after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s January 31, 2006 taxation year is its taxation year that began on February 1, 2007 and ended on January 31, 2008.\n[21] Therefore, if one only considers paragraph 13(27)(b), the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use on February 1, 2007, the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year ending on January 31, 2008.\n[22] However, subsection 13(27) is subject to subsection 13(31), which provides a deeming rule that applies, in part, when a person acquires property from a person with whom it is not dealing at arm\u2019s length. The subsection reads as follows:\n13(31) For the purposes of paragraphs (27)(b) and (28)(c) and subsection (29), where a property of a taxpayer was acquired from a person (in this subsection referred to as \u201cthe transferor\u201d)\n(a) with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length (otherwise than because of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)), or\n(b) in the course of a reorganization in respect of which, if a dividend were received by a corporation in the course of the reorganization, subsection 55(2) would not apply to the dividend because of the application of paragraph 55(3)(b),\nthe taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[23] Under paragraph 13(31)(a), where a taxpayer acquires property from a person with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length, the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[24] Paragraph 13(31)(b) applies where a taxpayer acquires property from a person in the course of a butterfly transaction described in paragraph 55(3)(b). It is not relevant for purposes of determining the point in time when the MCU Depreciable Properties were available for use.\n[25] The parties have agreed that the Appellant and the Limited Partnership were not dealing at arm\u2019s length at the time the Limited Partnership acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties. Therefore, under paragraph 13(31)(a), the Limited Partnership was deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. However, the Limited Partnership did not come into existence until February 1, 2005. In other words, the Limited Partnership did not exist at the time it was deemed under paragraph 13(31)(a) to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties.\n[26] This leads to an interpretation issue with respect to the effect of the subsection 13(31) deeming rule.\nPositions of the Parties\n[27] The Appellant argues that subsection 13(31) is designed to operate where the transferee did not yet exist at the time it was deemed to have acquired the property, namely the point in time when the property was acquired by the transferor. Specifically, in this situation, subsection 13(31), by its text, context and purpose, necessarily requires that the transferee have a notional taxation year at the time it is deemed to have acquired the property.\n[28] The Appellant notes that this interpretation gives effect to the relieving nature of paragraph 13(27)(b) and the continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s\u2011length parties in paragraph 13(31)(a).\n[29] The Appellant argues that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation is not harmonious with the Act because the Respondent\u2019s position requires a notional fiscal period of at least 13 months. Subsection 249(1.1) limits taxation years (and fiscal periods) of a partnership to 12 months.\n[30] It is the Appellant\u2019s position that the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in a notional taxation year beginning on February 1, 2004 and ending on January 31, 2005. The Appellant argues that this corresponds to the normal fiscal period that the Limited Partnership would have had, had it been in existence in January 2005.\n[31] The Appellant then argues that since the Limited Partnership is deemed under subsection 13(31) to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005, the properties became available for use on February 1, 2006, which was the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year that began on February 1, 2006 and ended on January 31, 2007. This is the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s notional taxation year that theoretically ended on January 31, 2005.\n[32] The Respondent agrees that under subsection 13(31), the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. However, he argues that subsection 13(31) only deems the date of acquisition for the acquiring taxpayer for purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b); it does nothing else. In particular, the deeming provision in subsection 13(31) does not deem or create a notional taxation year for the Limited Partnership that ends on January 31, 2005.\n[33] The Respondent emphasizes that a textual analysis of paragraph 13(27)(b) makes it clear that for a property to be available for use under this paragraph, at least two actual taxation years of the taxpayer must have passed after a property\u2019s acquisition. This is unambiguous and is not changed by the deeming rule in subsection 13(31).\n[34] The Respondent argues that the counting of the 357 days begins from the end of the first actual taxation year of the Limited Partnership\u2014the taxation year of the Limited Partnership ending on January 31, 2006. Under the Respondent\u2019s argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties became available for use on February 1, 2007, which was the first day of the Limited Partnership\u2019s taxation year that began on February 1, 2007 and ended on January 31, 2008.\n[35] The Limited Partnership taxation year that ended on January 31, 2008 was its first taxation year that began more than 357 days after the end of its first taxation year.\n[36] In summary, the Appellant argues that the MCU Depreciable Properties that the Limited Partnership was deemed to have acquired in January 2005 became available for use on February 1, 2006, while the Respondent argues that they became available for use on February 1, 2007.\nAnalysis and Disposition of the Appeal\n[37] In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, [2] the Supreme Court of Canada identified the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive\u201d principle as the principle that is to be used when interpreting the Act. At paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Court explained the principle as follows:\n[10] \u2026 The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play[s] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\n[38] The issue before the Court involves the application of the available-for-use rules in subsections 13(26) to (32). The authors of the book Timing and Income Taxation: The Principles of Income Measurement for Tax Purposes describe the purpose and effect of the available-for-use rules as follows:\nThe available-for-use rules, contained in subsections 13(26) through (32), are intended to prevent the claiming of capital cost allowance in respect of a property until that property is actually used in the income-earning process. These rules have the effect of matching the cost of the property incurred with revenue earned from the use of the property and are consistent with the claiming of depreciation for financial accounting purposes.[3]\n[39] The wording of each of the relevant provisions for purposes of this appeal (subsection 13(26), and paragraphs 13(27)(b) and 13(31)(a)) is clear\u2014there are no ambiguities.\n[40] Subsection 13(26) clearly states that it applies when one is applying the definition \u201cundepreciated capital cost\u201d in subsection 13(21) for the purpose of paragraph 20(1)(a) and any regulations made for the purposes of that paragraph, in computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business or property. In such a situation, subsection 13(26) provides that no amount shall be included in calculating the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of a prescribed class in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of a property of that class[4] before the time the property is considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer.\n[41] The wording is clear: when calculating a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from a business or property, the cost of a depreciable capital property cannot be added to the undepreciated capital cost of the relevant prescribed class until the property is available for use.\n[42] The wording accomplishes the Minister of Finance\u2019s purpose when putting the provision before Parliament as set out in the Department of Finance\u2019s May 1991 technical notes, which state the following:\nNew subsection 13(26) provides that, for the purpose only of calculating the capital cost allowance claim to which a taxpayer may be entitled, no amount in respect of a property is to be included in computing the undepreciated capital cost of depreciable property of a prescribed class until the property has become \u201cavailable for use\u201d by the taxpayer. The rules for determining the time at which property becomes \u201cavailable for use\u201d are provided in new subsections 13(27) to (32), described below.\n[43] As noted previously, paragraph 13(27)(b) is one of the rules that is used to determine when a property becomes available for use.\n[44] Paragraph 13(27)(b) only applies for the purposes of subsection 13(26) and is subject to subsection 13(29).[5] Subsection 13(29) applies where property (other than a building that is used or is to be used principally to earn rental income) is acquired in the course of a multi-year project. The subsection allows the taxpayer to make an election that modifies the normal available-for-use rules.\n[45] Paragraph 13(27)(b) clearly states that one of the times that property[6] acquired by a taxpayer shall be considered to have become available for use by the taxpayer is the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the taxpayer that begins more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the taxpayer in which the property was acquired by the taxpayer.\n[46] Similar to the wording of subsection 13(26), the wording of the paragraph is straightforward and contains no ambiguities.\n[47] As noted in the Department of Finance\u2019s May 1991 technical notes, the purpose of the paragraph is to provide that one of the times that property will be considered to be available for use is \u201cthe beginning of the first taxation year commencing at least 358 days after the taxation year in which the property was acquired (the two-year \u2018rolling start\u2019 rule)\u201d. The effect of the provision is to place a time limit on when a property may become available for use. The time limit is fixed by the dual requirements that the person or partnership acquiring the property have a taxation year-end following the acquisition of the property, which is followed by a second taxation year-end that is at least 357 days after the first taxation year-end.\n[48] Paragraph 13(31)(a) contains the deeming rule that is at issue in this appeal. It is not a complicated provision. The wording of the provision provides that:\n-The paragraph applies for the purposes of paragraphs 13(27)(b) and 13(28)(c) and subsection 13(29). As noted previously, subsection 13(29) applies to certain multi-year projects. Paragraph 13(28)(c) contains the same two-year rolling start rule as the rule provided in paragraph 13(27)(b); however, paragraph 13(28)(c) only applies to buildings.\n-Paragraph 13(31)(a) applies where a taxpayer acquires property from a person with whom the taxpayer was, at the time the taxpayer acquired the property, not dealing at arm\u2019s length.\n-Once the paragraph applies, the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[49] There are no ambiguities in this provision. Its application is limited to specific sections of the Act and it deems the non-arm\u2019s-length transferee to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[50] Paragraph 13(31)(a) clearly states that if the parties were dealing at non\u2011arm\u2019s-length at the time the property was transferred, then the taxpayer is deemed to have acquired the property at the time it was acquired by the transferor.\n[51] I agree with the Appellant that the wording of the paragraph leads to the conclusion that the purpose of the provision is to provide for continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s-length parties when applying the two-year rolling start rule.\n[52] The clear and unambiguous effect of the deeming rule in paragraph 13(31)(a) is that, for the purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b), the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005.\n[53] Therefore, the properties became available for use at the time that is immediately after the beginning of the first taxation year of the Limited Partnership that began more than 357 days after the end of the taxation year of the Limited Partnership in which the MCU Depreciable Properties were acquired by the Limited Partnership.\n[54] The question before the Court is, does paragraph 13(31)(a) deem the Limited Partnership to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in a notional taxation year created by subsection 13(31) that ended on January 31, 2005?\n[55] The answer depends on the effect of the deeming rule in subsection 13(31)\u2014a deeming rule that creates a legal fiction.\n[56] The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Verrette,[7] the seminal case on deeming rules, stated the following at page 845:\n\u2026 A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. \u2026\n[57] The Appellant asks the Court to find that the effect of the deeming rule in subsection 13(31), in the fact situation before the Court, is to create a notional taxation year for the purposes of paragraph 13(27)(b). I do not accept this argument.\n[58] I agree with the Respondent that subsection 13(31) only deems one thing to occur. It deems the Limited Partnership to have acquired the MCU Depreciable Properties in January 2005. It does not deem the Limited Partnership to have a notional taxation year.\n[59] The Appellant is asking me to read words into the provision that are not there. That is not the role of the Court; rather, it is the role of Parliament to determine the wording of a provision. If Parliament had intended that a notional taxation year be created in the fact situation before the Court, then it would have specifically stated that a notional taxation year is created. This would require very specific and detailed language.\n[60] As I noted in Vefghi Holding Corp. v. The King[8] at paragraph 55, once it is determined that a deeming provision applies, one must then look at the actual wording of the deeming provision to determine what legal fiction is created. Specifically, one must determine to what extent the created legal fiction changes what, as a question of fact, actually occurred. In making this determination, one must remember that the scope of a deeming provision is limited to what is clearly expressed in the provision.[9]\n[61] Subsection 13(31) deems an acquisition of property to occur on a different day than the day that the property was actually acquired. However, that is all it does; it does not contain any wording that deems the Limited Partnership, for purposes of subsection 13(27) or any other section of the Act, to have been in existence prior to its formation on February 1, 2005 or to have had a notional taxation year prior to the time that it came into existence.\n[62] Both parties focused on the paragraph 249(1)(a) definition of taxation year.\n[63] Paragraph 96(1)(b) of the Act provides that when calculating the income of a taxpayer who is a member of a partnership, the income is to be computed as if the partnership were a separate person resident in Canada whose taxation year was its fiscal period.\n[64] Paragraph 249(1)(a), as it currently reads, states the following: \u201cIn this Act, except as expressly otherwise provided, a \u2018taxation year\u2019 is in the case of a corporation or Canadian resident partnership, a fiscal period\u201d. This paragraph was amended effective October 31, 2006 to add the words \u201cCanadian resident partnership\u201d. Prior to that time, paragraph 249(1)(a) only referred to a corporation.\n[65] As both parties stated, the effect of paragraphs 96(1)(b) and 249(1)(a) is that during the relevant periods, the taxation year of the Limited Partnership was its fiscal period.\n[66] Fiscal period is defined in subsection 249.1(1). During the relevant periods, paragraph 249.1(1)(c) was the relevant paragraph for purposes of this appeal. It reads as follows:\n249.1(1) For the purposes of this Act, a \u201cfiscal period\u201d of a business or a property of a person or partnership means the period for which the person's or partnership's accounts in respect of the business or property are made up for purposes of assessment under this Act, but no fiscal period may end \u2026\n(c) ... more than 12 months after the period began.[10]\n[67] Since the Limited Partnership did not exist prior to February 1, 2005, it did not prepare accounts prior to February 1, 2005. Therefore, it did not have a fiscal period prior to February 1, 2005. As a result, it did not have a taxation year under the Act prior to February 1, 2005.\n[68] There is nothing in the wording of subsection 13(31) that creates the fiction of the Limited Partnership having a year-end prior to February 1, 2005\u2014specifically, as the Appellant argues, a 12-month fictional taxation year that ended on January 31, 2005. The creation of such a fictional taxation year would require very specific wording that, at a minimum, addresses the fictional existence of the Limited Partnership during this period and the beginning and end of the fictional taxation year.\n[69] The Appellant argues that the creation of a notional taxation year is consistent with the rationale for the available-for-use rules in subsections 13(26) to (32). I do not agree. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s position defeats the purpose of the two-year rolling start rule by shortening the length of time that the Limited Partnership is required to have held the property to one completed taxation year.\n[70] As noted by the Respondent, the two-year rolling start rule does not look at when the property is first used to produce income, but rather allows for the claiming of CCA in the third taxation year after the property is acquired. As previously stated, subsection 13(27) imposes a waiting period that is determined by reference to two taxation year-ends. In order for subsection 13(27)(b) to apply, the taxpayer must acquire the property, the taxpayer must have a year-end, and then 357 days must pass before the next year-end of the taxpayer. Under subsection 13(27)(b), two actual year-ends must pass before a property is considered to have become available for use.\n[71] Under the Appellant\u2019s position, the time is shortened by one actual year-end of the Limited Partnership. Since the notional taxation year would be before the start of the Limited Partnership\u2019s first taxation year, under the Appellant\u2019s position, the Limited Partnership could claim CCA in respect of the MCU Depreciable Properties immediately after the end of its first taxation year, as long as its first taxation year is at least 357 days. In my view, this defeats the purpose of the two-year rolling start rule.\n[72] Subsection 13(31) attempts to preserve the two-year rolling start rule when depreciable property is transferred between non-arm\u2019s-length parties. In the situation where the transferor and transferee have different year-ends, the actual date when the property is available for use will change; however, the time period must still include two taxation year-ends, spread more than 357 days apart.\n[73] It is not the intention of subsection 13(31) to shorten the time period to one actual year-end.\n[74] The Appellant\u2019s fact situation shows that this is what would occur if the Court accepts the Appellant\u2019s argument. Under the Appellant\u2019s argument, only one actual taxation year of the Limited Partnership would pass before the MCU Depreciable Properties become available for use.\n[75] If I accept the Appellant\u2019s argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties that the Limited Partnership is deemed to have acquired in January 2005 would become available for use on February 1, 2006, after the end of the Limited Partnership\u2019s first taxation year.\n[76] The Respondent\u2019s argument, however, preserves the two-year rolling start rule. Under his argument, the MCU Depreciable Properties become available for use on February 1, 2007, after the end of the second taxation year of the Limited Partnership.\n[77] The Respondent\u2019s position is consistent with the purpose of paragraph 13(31)(a) to provide continuity of ownership between non-arm\u2019s-length parties, while preserving the two-year rolling start rule.\n[78] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed, with costs.\nSigned at Winnipeg, Manitoba, this 12th day of March 2024.\n\u201cS.

The Appellant did not do either of these things within that deadline nor has she done so since.\n[5] On February 5, 2024, the Registry wrote to the Appellant and asked the Appellant to provide any written representations that the Appellant might have about the Motion prior to February 13, 2024. The Appellant did not respond to that letter by that date nor has she done so since.\n[6] I have reviewed the Respondent\u2019s motion materials. I am satisfied that:\n(a)the Appellant was made aware of this issue as soon as the Respondent filed the Reply;\n(b)she has had multiple chances to address the issue since then;\n(c)she has failed to do so in any meaningful way;\n(d)she knew that the Respondent intended to bring the Motion; and\n(e)she failed to respond to the Motion.\n[7] In the circumstances, I have concluded that it is appropriate to decide the Motion based on written representations. As the Appellant has not filed any written representations, I will determine the issue based on the materials provided by the Respondent.\nQuashing [8] Based on the Respondent\u2019s materials, I find that the Appellant did not file a Notice of Objection to the reassessment of her 2008 tax year.\n[9] I am satisfied that the CRA did not receive a Notice of Objection for that year. The Appellant has not produced a copy of the Notice of Objection that she says she filed. She has not provided any details of when or how she filed it. She has not even been able to explain what she was objecting to beyond asserting that it involved $250 or less. There appears to be no connection between the GLGI issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal in respect of her 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and the small amount she says she is disputing for her 2008 tax year. In the circumstances, I find it difficult to conclude that she actually filed a Notice of Objection.\n[10] A taxpayer cannot appeal the reassessment of a tax year to this Court if the taxpayer has not first filed a Notice of Objection. Therefore, the appeal of the reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2008 tax year must be quashed.\nCosts [11] The Respondent has requested costs in respect of the motion. I will award those costs.\n[12] To the extent that the Respondent wants to seek costs in respect of the appeal of the 2008 taxation year as a whole, the Respondent may raise those costs at the conclusion of the trial of the appeals of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years as the trial judge will be in a better position to assess the costs of the appeals of the four years as a whole.\nSigned at Calgary, Alberta, this 12th day of March 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] In my May 10, 2023 judgment allowing the appeal with costs to the appellant, I gave the parties time to reach an agreement on costs failing which they were directed to file written submissions for my consideration. I also directed that if I did not hear from the parties with respect to costs, then costs would be awarded to the appellant according to Tariff B.[1]\n[2] The parties did not reach an agreement as to costs so they have provided written submissions. The appellant proposes that it is entitled to costs of $197,527.69 (being 75% of its solicitor and client costs) plus disbursements of $4,122.71. On the other hand, the respondent disagrees, saying that tariff costs are appropriate. At the Court\u2019s request, appellant\u2019s counsel provided copies of the legal invoices and summaries of disbursements.\nII. Procedural history\n[3] The one-and-a-half day hearing took place in April 2022 and was a Class C proceeding. The issue was whether certain services provided by the appellant were preparatory in nature and therefore fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d.[2] If so, then the services would fall outside the definition and would not be GST-exempt, thus obliging the appellant to collect and remit tax totaling $910,265 for the reporting periods from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016.[3]\n[4] The appeal was commenced in August 2020 and pleadings closed by December 2020. In January 2021, the Court issued a litigation timetable order based on dates proposed by the parties; no amendments were required. In July 2021, the appellant filed an amended notice of appeal with the respondent\u2019s consent. Later the same month, the respondent filed a reply to the amended notice of appeal and the timeline to do so was extended with the appellant\u2019s consent.\n[5] In September 2021, the parties submitted a joint application for a three-day hearing and requested an earlier sitting to accommodate appellant counsel\u2019s availability. The hearing was set down for April 19 to 21, 2022 and completed in one-and-a-half days. At the hearing, the parties relied on a statement of partial agreed facts and an agreed book of documents; two witnesses testified on behalf of the appellant. Judgment was reserved and while under reserve, the parties made three sets of follow-up written submissions in April 2022, July 2022, and January 2023. I did not request any of these submissions but agreed to consider them in the interest of procedural fairness.\nIII. Legislative framework\n[6] Section 147 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) gives this Court broad discretion to determine costs. The determination must be done on a principled basis which includes a proper weighing of the factors set in subsection 147(3).[4] No expert witnesses testified so the relevant factors are as follows:\nthe result of the proceeding;\nthe amounts in issue;\nthe importance of the issues;\nany offer of settlement made in writing;\nthe volume of work;\nthe complexity of the issues;\nthe conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding;\nthe denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted;\nwhether any stage in the proceedings was\n(i)improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii)taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution; and\nany other matter relevant to the question of costs.[5]\nIV. Analysis and discussion\n(a) The result of the proceeding [7] The relevant facts were the same across the reporting periods, which effectively made the appeal an all-or-nothing matter in which the appellant was wholly successful. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(b) The amounts in issue [8] The significance of the amounts in issue must be considered contextually and in relative terms.[6] In this instance, the amount of GST in issue was in the range of $200,000 per year based on fees paid by the appellant in the $4M range each year[7] and set against gross revenues exceeding $100M annually.[8]\n[9] The appellant says that the amounts in issue are greater than meets the eye because subsequent years are under audit and turned on the outcome of this appeal. I am not of the view that those amounts should be taken into consideration for the purposes of a costs award. To consider impacts outside the scope of an appeal in this way invites a degree of uncertainty that can make a costs determination nearly impossible.\n[10] While the amounts in issue would be significant in many instances, they are less so in the specific context of this case. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(c) The importance of the issues [11] At the time the decision was rendered, there was (and perhaps continues to be) no other decision dealing with the type of financial services in question in the context of credit unions. While one cannot know how many other credit unions might operate similarly to the appellant and therefore, be affected by this decision, it is reasonable to assume that there are some. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(d) Any offer of settlement made in writing [12] No written settlement offers were made so substantial indemnity costs[9] cannot be considered. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(e) The volume of work [13] Based on the invoice summary and the invoices submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel, legal fees were billed for approximately 296.6 hours of work. At the documentary disclosure stage, the appellant listed 60 documents while the respondent listed 42. Examinations for discovery by each party took less than one day[10] and there were no interlocutory applications. By the commencement of hearing, the parties were able to file a statement of partial agreed facts[11] and a joint book of 25 documents[12].\n[14] Explaining financial services delivered on an ongoing basis on a large scale by a financial institution would require an above-average amount of work to set out the factual context for the purposes of prosecuting the appeal. Five days before the hearing, the respondent conceded that the services in question fell within paragraph (l) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d, thus reducing the issue to a question of whether they then fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4).[13]\n[15] While the concession ultimately reduced the length of the hearing and the amount of preparation required, I would expect that the relatively short notice of the concession resulted in a meaningful amount of preparation already having been done on a material issue. Therefore, this factor favours increased costs.\n(f) The complexity of the issues [16] I am of the view that the substantive issues were average in complexity, particularly since they were narrowed down to the application of paragraph (r.4) by the time of the hearing. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(g) The conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding [17] In October 2021, the respondent conceded the issue of whether the appellant was required to collect and remit GST on services provided to Desjardins Financial Group with respect to the issuance of credit cards. The respondent later also conceded that the remaining services in question fell within paragraph (l) of the definition of \u201cfinancial service\u201d, thus reducing the issue to a question of whether they then fell within the exception in paragraph (r.4). Finally, the parties proceeded by way of a statement of partial agreed facts and a joint book of documents, both of which required the respondent\u2019s cooperation and consent.\n[18] The appellant argues that in light of the concession made five days before the hearing, that the respondent should have conceded the entire appeal. The remaining issue as to whether the exception in paragraph (r.4) applied was a valid one and the respondent was entitled to continue to dispute it. Therefore, this factor is neutral.\n(h) The denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted [19] This factor is neutral for the reasons discussed under subheading (g).\n(i) Whether any stage in the proceedings was (i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or (ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution [20] There is no evidence of this type of conduct so this factor is neutral.\n(j) Any other matter relevant to the question of costs [21] I am not of the view that there are any other relevant matters to consider in terms of costs.\nV. Conclusion\n[22] Based on the above, I am of the view that a costs award of $19,600 plus disbursements of $4,122.71 is appropriate, i.e. for a total of $23,722.71. The costs award approximately doubles the tariff, and takes into account the fact that there were amended pleadings, supplementary lists of documents filed by the appellant, an agreed statement of facts, and an agreement regarding documents. In making this award, I am particularly mindful of the appellant\u2019s success, the possible importance of this decision to other credit unions, and the late concession by the respondent with respect to paragraph (l) which shortened the hearing but likely led to some unnecessary trial preparation by the appellant.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 13th day of March 2024.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 34\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-1578(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nPROSPERA CREDIT UNION AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\nDATE OF HEARING:\nDetermined by written submissions\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:\nThe Honourable Justice Susan Wong\nDATE OF ORDER:\nMarch 13, 2024\nAPPEARANCES:\nCounsel for the Appellant:\nJoel A.

The reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 were statute-barred at the time of reassessment.\n[2] Because of the reassessments, the appellant\u2019s net tax liability was increased by $646,000. Encore was also assessed for gross negligence penalties, which amount to approximately $162,000.\nI. ISSUES\n[3] There are four main issues on appeal. They are:\n(i) Whether the Minister correctly assessed additional GST\/HST payable by the appellant; (ii) Whether the Minister correctly disallowed specific Input Tax Credits (\u201cITCs\u201d) claimed; (iii) Whether the appellant is liable for a penalty pursuant to s. 285 of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1], and (iv) Whether the Minister was correct in relying upon ss. 298(4) of the Act, to reassess the statute-barred reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 (the \u201cStatute-Barred Periods\u201d).[2] II. FACTS\n[4] The appellant is a GST registrant, having been registered for GST since May 26, 2005. The appellant had annual reporting periods from May 1, 2009 until April 30, 2012 and quarterly reporting periods until April 30, 2014.\n[5] The Minister reassessed the appellant for the Relevant Periods on or about October 28, 2015 (the \u201cReassessment\u201d). The appellant served the Minister with Notices of Objection on December 17, 2015 and on March 22, 2018.\n[6] The Minister determined that the appellant underreported GST\/HST payable amounting to $114,032.56 in the relevant period. The Minister reached this conclusion based upon an analysis of the appellant\u2019s general ledger, subsequent adjusting entries made to the general ledger by the appellant\u2019s accountant, and an analysis of the appellant\u2019s bank records.\n[7] A portion of the ITCs claimed by the appellant, amounting to $474,816, were denied by the Minister. At trial, the appellant agreed that ITCs were over claimed, but argued that they should be allowed a portion of the ITCs denied, totalling $182,622.\n[8] Further to the above paragraph, the appellant incorrectly claimed ITCs based upon a calculation of 13\/113 of the value of the consideration identified as having been paid for goods (based on Encore\u2019s accountant, Mr. Nasrullah\u2019s review of the bank records).\n[9] The ITCs being litigated came from two main sources. The first source of claimed ITCs relates to certain import goods purchased from non-registrant, non resident suppliers. These ITCs were claimed in relation to amounts identified as paid from the appellant\u2019s US fund bank account. The amount claimed by the appellant was $203,184. The Minister allowed $3,584.92 of this amount and denied the remaining claim for ITCs.\n[10] An additional $275,216.46 was claimed by the appellant and denied by the Minister. These claimed ITCs relate to invoices that were identified as RPW[3] and were paid to a foreign supplier[4].\n[11] Penalties were assessed. Overall, the Minister increased the appellant\u2019s net tax for the Relevant Periods by $646,784 and imposed total penalties of $161,953.47.\n[12] Three witnesses testified at trial. They were, Mr. Tahir Bajwa, the sole shareholder and director of the appellant. Mr. Mark Hatfield, a retired CRA officer who worked on the audit of the appellant that lead to the reassessment before the Court, and Mr. Ganesh Timsina, a team leader with CRA who attempted to explain the reassessment. I will more fully describe their testimony in the body of the facts.\nA. Business of the Appellant\n[13] During the Relevant Periods, the appellant was in the business of selling cellphones, accessories, and providing unlocking services for cellphones. The appellant had three retail locations.\n[14] Tahir Bajwa is the sole shareholder, director and decision maker of the appellant. Mr. Bajwa is responsible for completing and filing the appellant\u2019s GST\/HST returns.\n[15] Mr. Bajwa has been involved in the purchasing and selling of mobile telephones for approximately 20 years.\nB. Discrepancies in the General Ledger\n[16] An audit of the appellant began on February 8, 2014. Shortly after the commencement of the audit, the accountant for the appellant, Mr. Nasrullah, made various adjusting entries in the general ledger of the appellant.\n[17] In particular, the appellant\u2019s general ledger had the following correcting entries (this is the description provided in the g\/l for the entries).\nTo adjust HST account, 2011, HST account, $6431.66. 2012, HST account, $10,977.96. 2013, HST account, $25,719.78. I am making this adjustment as I feel these are actual HST payable and it -- and it should -- is not adjustment to today, is at 7:26 P.M.\n[18] These entries increased the GST\/HST payable by $43,129.40.\n[19] An additional adjusting entry, increasing GST\/HST payable by $38,744.92 was made on April 30th, 2014.\n[20] The Minister argued that these entries were correcting entries by the appellant\u2019s accountant, to record GST\/HST payable that was not included in the appellant\u2019s GST\/HST filings.\n[21] The Adjustments are not reflected in any of the appellant\u2019s returns filed.[5] Mr. Bajwa offered no explanation for these adjustments (this is considered further in the below paragraphs).\n[22] Mr. Nasrullah did not testify at trial, despite the fact that he resides in Toronto, appears to be the only party able to answer many crucial questions, and still does work for Mr. Bajwa.\nC. Mr. Bajwa\u2019s Testimony\n[23] Mr. Bajwa was born in Pakistan. After moving to and being educated in Germany, he moved to Canada with his family in 2000. He attended high school and college in Canada. He obtained an education in Business studies in both Germany and Canada.\n[24] He opened Encore Cellular in 2005. He began his business by buying mobile phone accessories (such as phone covers). This soon evolved into purchasing and selling cellular telephones and various other related products.\n[25] Specific to the issues in the litigation, Mr. Bajwa testified that when he bought the cellphones, the suppliers were outside of Canada. He testified that the price he paid to his suppliers was a landed price. As per his testimony, this meant he paid all costs for the telephones to the supplier when they arrived at his warehouse, including GST.\n[26] The evidence at trial did not support Mr. Bajwa\u2019s claim of paying a landed price. Instances were provided in his testimony in which Encore Cellular Inc. paid additional fees upon receiving the goods in Canada. Also, no receipts or contracts or any other corroborating documents were provided that support the contention that a landed price was negotiated.\n[27] Overall, it was very hard to determine the terms and conditions of the purchase of the goods bought by the appellant. Many business records were missing. Mr. Bajwa testified that in numerous instances he agreed to the terms of buying products from his suppliers by way of a telephone call, and advanced funds based upon the call with his supplier. In these instances there were no records to support the details of his purchases (or if they occurred). The only evidence we have is money being sent by the appellant to the foreign supplier. I do not know how many times this occurred, but it does appear it was a significant amount.\n[28] Mr. Bajwa hired Mr. Nasrullah to prepare his GST returns. Mr. Nasrullah was at that time and still is a family friend. His accounting services were done at year end. At that time, the appellant provided Mr. Nasrullah with Encore\u2019s bank statements. From these Mr. Nasrullah would prepare the appellant\u2019s general ledgers. He would also prepare the GST filings. Mr. Bajwa testified that he relied upon the accountant\u2019s work entirely to calculate and remit the proper GST amounts owing for the appellant.\n[29] Mr. Bajwa was clear in his testimony that he had no knowledge of the accounting practices of Encore.\n[30] Furthermore, the appellant did no bookkeeping on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Rather the accounting was done at year end by Mr. Nasrullah.\nQ: Okay. Now, can you tell me, did you do any bookkeeping for Encore during the relevant period?\nA: No. I have no experience on bookkeeping.\nQ: You did no bookkeeping for Encore?\nA: No.\nQ: Who did the bookkeeping?\nA: No one.\nQ: No one did any bookkeeping for Encore?\nA: No.[6]\n[31] Concerning the general ledger, Mr. Bajwa testified that he did not understand the general ledger, and could offer no explanation as to its contents. Mr. Bajwa was clear that, even in preparing for trial, he did not ask Mr. Nasrullah, nor inform himself in any way, as to why the general ledger and the GST\/HST filings were inconsistent.\nMR. TARIQ: Mr. Bajwa, if the general ledger and the tax return don't match, could you explain why they wouldn't match?\nA: I can't explain that because I'm not an accountant.[7]\n\u2026\nAnd\nQ: Here, we have in the table below, the first entry, May 1st, 2009, to April 30th, 2010. You reported a GST collectible amount of $63,753.41. Do you see that?\nA: Yeah.\nQ: Why is that different from the amount that the ledger shows is collected, $69,117.09?\nA: I have no idea. That's answer for -- like, Mr. Nasrullah can answer that. I have no idea. I never have gone to ever from this ledger in my life after that (INDISCERNIBLE) presented to me.[8]\n\u2026\nAnd\nQ: Mr. Nasrullah (sic), would you be able to answer any of the discrepancies in the ledger, between the ledger and the returns?\nA: I can't answer that about that ledger because I have no understanding about this ledger, so \u2026[9]\nAnd\nQ: So, Mr. Bajwa, the Minister found these discrepancies. I've just walked you through the first period, which you were unable to account for. The rest of the -- the discrepancies for each of the period is listed below that in each subsequent row. Can you explain any of these discrepancies?\nA: No. I have no understanding about these things.\nQ: Did you ever ask your accountant why your tax returns don't match your general ledger?\nA: No.\nQ: You never asked?\nA: I never asked. I never knew what general ledger was (INDISCERNIBLE). I never knew that.\nQ: Did you ever seek clarification after the audit?\nA: I was asking him all the time, then he send it -- he say that I'm going to send it to CRA for adjustment or whatever. And after that is, like -- the whole thing start, and then nothing.[10]\n[32] Concerning the underreported GST, at the end of the trial, what I am left with are adjusting entries made by the accountant that seem to indicate that more GST should have been paid to the Minister than was in the appellant\u2019s filings. Furthermore, pursuant to an audit of the general ledger and the bank records, a conclusion was reached by the Minister that the appellant underreported the amount of GST owing.\n[33] The appellant contests the Minister\u2019s position that additional GST should have been paid, but offers absolutely no evidence as to why the general ledger appears to indicate more GST was owing than was remitted. On a more specific basis, no explanation at all was provided by the appellant as to why the adjusting entries were made to the general ledger by Mr. Nasrullah nor how they should be interpreted. Despite being assessed with a large amount of additional GST payable, the appellant has come to court, without Mr. Nasrullah, and uninformed as to the issues before the Court.\n[34] The appellant is therefore unsuccessful on the issue of underreported GST. Subject to my finding concerning the statue barred period of April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2011, this portion of the appeal is unsuccessful.\nD. Evidence of the Appellant Concerning the ITCs Claimed\n[35] In examination in chief, Mr. Bajwa referred to and described various invoices from suppliers outside of Canada. Unfortunately this was not very informative. The appellant at no point walked me through the entirety of a transaction.\n[36] Specifically no evidence was provided as to how much GST was paid when the purchased goods came into Canada.\n[37] Mr. Bajwa provided a sampling of invoices from various suppliers and also provided bank statements showing money being wired from a bank account to a specific supplier. The invoice never indicated GST being paid. Mr. Bajwa could not show me, or offer any evidence, as to what GST was remitted on goods when they came across the border. The appellant simply asked that I estimate the amount of GST paid to be 5% of the amount paid in the USA for the purchases.\n[38] The only time I was walked through the entirety of a transaction, it was done by the respondent in the cross examination of Mr. Bajwa. This was very detrimental to the appellant\u2019s case. In that instance it showed the following:\nAn initial purchase price for cell phones from a supplier in Michigan, indicating that the appellant paid $10,761.73 in US dollars on January 14, 2013. The ITC that would have been claimed on this purchase would have been 13\/113 of the amount, which is $1237 US dollars.[11]\nWhen these cellular telephones were declared at the Canadian border, by a custom broker hired by the appellant, they were declared to be worth $322 Canadian. The actual amount of GST paid for the goods was $15.84.\nThe proper amount to pay to bring the cellular telephones across the border would have been 5% of their value (which is in most cases the amount paid for the item).\nNo explanation was offered by the appellant as to why the value of the purchased goods was undervalued at border.\n[39] This simply demonstrates the importance of 169(4) of the Act. It ensures that ITCs are limited to the amount of GST actually paid.\nE. Mark Hatfield\u2019s Testimony\n[40] Mr. Hatfield is a retired CRA auditor who assisted in the audit of Encore. The appellant called him as a witness.\n[41] In this role he helped prepare several of the working papers relied upon by the Minister in their assessment. The appellant\u2019s counsel called him to support one main proposition. That being, for the purpose of s.180 of the Act, the Minister was satisfied that GST was paid when the supplies in issue were brought into the country. The importance of this point will become obvious upon a review of the requirements of s. 180 of the Act. It should be further pointed out that Mr. Hatfield testified that he did not turn his mind to s. 180 at the time of audit.\n[42] Specifically the appellant relies upon the following testimony of Mr. Hatfield:\nOkay. Generally, goods would not come into Canada without HST or GST or HST. Being from Newfoundland, Labrador, it's HST, and probably here as well. But on commercial goods, the importation's generally five percent, and somebody has to pay tax at the border. Sir -- I mean, if tax is not paid, it's because of some other activity, not -- not normal course of business.[12]\n\u2026\nAnd\nMS. TAYLOR: So you determined that no goods could come into Canada without the GST being paid on it.\nA: Correct. I wouldn't make a 100 percent statement to that effect, but that's the say it's supposed to work, yes.\nQ: And you, in fact, found with respect to the supplies made by the appellant that the customer is basically the importer, and the tax was paid at the border.\nA: I don't recall actually doing the test, but I do know in having reviewed my statement that I made that statement and I -- I certainly can't refute it.\nJUSTICE: What's -- what's the statement again? What -- what's your position that -- was GST paid on these transactions, or --\nA: Well, yeah, that HST was paid by the supplier, the non-registrant, non-resident, that they paid the tax on importation, and by extension, then, the -- the recipient of supply may be entitled to a input tax credit.\nQ: MS. TAYLOR: So, that directly contradicts the allegation that's immediately following that in the amended reply, that no GST, HST was paid on the importation of any goods corresponding to the US account invoices in excess of what was allowed by the Minister.\nA: Yes, what -- what I would have made as a statement is that there was no documentation provided that HST was paid on the importation.[13]\n[43] The appellant relies upon this statement for the proposition that the Minister accepted that evidence exists that is satisfactory to the Minister that the GST tax has been paid by the non resident supplier (a requirement of s. 180 of the Act).\n[44] The respondent denies that the Minister has accepted that GST has been paid and pleads, in paragraph 24 of their Amended Reply: The appellant failed to obtain documentation that contains the information prescribed by section 3 of the Regulations and failed to obtain satisfactory evidence as required by paragraph 180(c) of the Act.\nF. Ganesh Timsina\u2019s Testimony\n[45] Mr. Timsina, a CRA employee, was the Appeals officer on the file. Much of his evidence came by way of cross-examination. Appellant\u2019s counsel clearly hoped to refute the Minister\u2019s various assessing positions through this witness. I do not find that happened. Various points in the examination were confusing. In these instances, either the witness was not understanding the appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s questions or counsel was not understanding the answers provided. Overall, I did not find the evidence to be helpful for either side in making my decision.\nIII. ISSUES\n[46] The remaining issues are:\nDid the Minister correctly disallow the appellant\u2019s claimed ITCs?\nDoes the appellant benefit from the deeming provisions of ss.178.8 or s.180 of the Act?\nWas GST paid on importation in relation to this amount?\nHas the registrant obtained sufficient evidence that will enable the amount of ITC to be determined?\nWas the Minister justified in assessing the appellant for the Statute-Barred Periods of April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2011?\nDid the Minister correctly assess the appellant for a penalty of $161,953.00 pursuant to section 285 of the Act?\nIV. ANALYSIS\nA. General Framework for ITCs\n[47] Subsection 225(1) provides that a taxpayer may deduct ITCs from their net tax calculation. Subsection 169(1) provides the general rule for qualifying for ITCs. ITCs are determined based on the product of 1) GST\/HST paid or payable in a reporting period and 2) the extent to which the supplies are consumed, used or supplied in the course of the registrant\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d.[14] ITCs can be claimed against zero-rated supplies.[15]\n[48] Because these sections were relied upon by the appellant, I will provide analysis concerning s. 178.8 and s. 180 of the Act. Unfortunately for the appellant, my conclusions in this regard will not advance their case. This is because the appellant does not meet the requirement of ss. 169(4), in that the appellant has not, prior to claiming the ITC in their return, obtained sufficient evidence to enable the proper amount of the ITC to be determined.\n[49] The respondent has assumed, at paragraph 13(n) of the Amended Reply, that no GST\/HST was paid by the foreign suppliers, nor was GST\/HST paid on the importation of any goods corresponding to the US account invoices, in excess of what was allowed by the Minister. Even when considering the testimony of Mr. Hatfield, I do not find that this assumption has been destroyed.\nB. Paying GST\/HST on Import and Sections 178.8 and 180\n[50] Sections 178.8 and 180 of the Act are special case provisions, which deem persons to have paid tax, potentially entitling them to qualify for ITCs.[16]\n[51] The pertinent text of s. 178.8 as it stood during the Relevant Periods is reproduced below:\nDefinition of specified supply\n178.8 (1) In this section, specified supply means a supply of goods that\n(a) are, at any time after the supply is made, imported; or\n(b) have been imported in circumstances in which section 144 deems the supply to have been made outside Canada.\nDeemed importer of goods\n(2) Subject to subsections (4) and (7), if a recipient of a specified supply of goods made outside Canada does not, at any time before the release of the goods, supply the goods outside Canada and the recipient or any other person imported the goods for consumption, use or supply by the recipient (in this section referred to as the \u201cconstructive importer\u201d), the constructive importer is deemed to have so imported the goods, and any amount paid or payable as or on account of tax on the goods under Division III in respect of the importation is deemed to have been paid or payable, as the case may be, by or on behalf of the constructive importer and not by or on behalf of any other person\u2026[17]\n[52] Subsections 178.8(8) and (9) provide various exceptions to the application of 178.8(2). None of these exceptions appear to be relevant to this appeal except that when section 180 applies, subsection 178.8(2) does not apply.[18]\n[53] Section 178.8 is designed to provide relief in a circumstance where a non-resident sells a supply to a Canadian registrant whereby legal delivery occurs outside Canada, but the Canadian registrant does not import the supply into Canada.[19] In such a circumstance, the non-resident would be required to pay GST\/HST on import, but the non-resident might not be able to qualify for ITCs. Section 178.8 provides the possibility of qualifying for an ITC to the Canadian purchaser by deeming the Canadian purchaser as having paid GST\/HST on import to prevent double payment of GST\/HST in what is effectively commercial activity.\n[54] I am unable to apply section 178.8 to deem the appellant to have paid tax on import. This section only deems tax to have been paid or payable to the extent that tax was in fact paid or payable on importation. As noted above, the respondent\u2019s assumption that no GST\/HST was paid upon importation stands.\n[55] Appellant\u2019s counsel argues that I can calculate the GST\/HST amount paid by accepting Mr. Nasrullah\u2019s review of the bank statements, from which he calculated the amount paid to foreign suppliers. In order to get these foreign purchased goods into Canada, GST of 5% should have been paid at the border.\n[56] If I were to ignore the respondent\u2019s assumption noted above, there is still too much uncertainty to accept the calculation proposed by the appellant. For one, I have no idea as to what the declared value of the goods purchased from the non resident was when they were brought into Canada. This greatly affects the GST paid. Other obvious uncertainties also exist. These include the fact that, in many instances, given the lack of invoices, no evidence has been lead as to the details concerning the relevant transactions when the appellant sent the funds to the U.S. supplier, such as what was purchased and how much was paid for each item.\nC. Section 180\n[57] The text of s.180 reads as follows:\nReceipt of property from non-resident\n180 For the purposes of determining an input tax credit of, or the amount of a rebate payable under section 259 or 260 to, a particular person, where a non-resident person who is not registered under Subdivision D of Division V\n(a) either\n(i) makes a supply of tangible personal property to the particular person and delivers the property, or makes it available, in Canada to the particular person before the property is used in Canada by or on behalf of the non-resident person, or\n(ii) where the particular person is a registrant, causes physical possession of tangible personal property to be transferred in Canada to the particular person in circumstances in which the particular person is acquiring physical possession of the property for the purpose of making a taxable supply of a commercial service in respect of the property to the non-resident person,\n(b) has paid tax under Division III in respect of the importation of the property or has paid tax in respect of a supply of the property deemed under subsection 179(1) to have been made by a registrant, and\n(c) provides to the particular person evidence, satisfactory to the Minister, that the tax has been paid,\nthe particular person shall be deemed\n(d) to have paid, at the time the non-resident person paid that tax, tax in respect of a supply of the property to the particular person equal to that tax, and\n(e) in a case described in subparagraph (a)(ii), to have acquired the property for use exclusively in commercial activities of the particular person.[20]\n[58] As described in the technical notes, the purpose of s.180 is to prevent GST from being paid twice due to a non-resident in the billing chain having paid tax without being able to claim ITCs.\n[59] Section 180 provides relief where legal delivery occurs in Canada, but the non-resident pays GST\/HST on import.\n[60] One important difference between subsection 178.8(2) and section 180 is that section 180, unlike subsection 178.8(2), requires evidence satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid.\n[61] The CRA has provided that for the purposes of section 180:\n\u201cSatisfactory proof includes a copy of Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Form B3-3, Canada Customs Coding Form, showing that the GST or the federal part of the HST was paid at the time of import.\u201d[21]\n[62] It was clear, based on the evidence of Mr. Hatfield, as well as the working papers that were put in evidence, that s.180 was not considered at the audit or objection stage. The section was only added, in the amended Notice of Appeal, well into the litigation process (in fact the trial of this matter was adjourned, in part, to allow the appellant to amend pleadings and add this argument). The Minister clearly did not turn their mind to this provision until late in the litigation process.\n[63] Mr. Hatfield\u2019s statement at trial does not bind the Minister. He did not state that he accepted, at audit, that \u201cthe non-resident provides the taxpayer with evidence that is satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid.\u201d He testified that he felt that the GST should have been paid at the border. He also testified that the issue was probably the lack of records.\n[64] Despite the able and creative submissions from appellant\u2019s counsel, I do not find that the Minister concluded that evidence that is satisfactory to the Minister that the tax has been paid exists. The Amended Notice of Reply states the respondent\u2019s position. The lack of records, or any evidence, concerning the transaction on which the ITCs are claimed supports their position. Even if it were in my authority, I would not override the Minister\u2019s discretion on this point. I therefore find that section 180 does not apply.\n[65] If I am wrong, and section 180 does apply, I still am unable to allow the appeal and allow the ITCs the appellant seeks. This is because, as set out below, the appellant fails to meet the requirements of s. 169 of the Act.\nD. Requirements to Qualify for ITCs\n[66] As described above, the appellant admitted at the outset of trial that the ITCs claimed were incorrect. This error was a result of a flawed methodology. In determining the ITCs (in issue) the appellant used bank statements to identify purchases, and then applied a 13\/113 calculation to determine the ITCs. Given that these ITCs relate to goods purchased from non-registrants in the United States, the only GST that would have been paid was 5%, incurred when importing the goods into Canada. This concession by the appellant reduced the input tax credit claim in issue at trial from the aggregate amount of $474,816 to $182,622.\n[67] As the appellant\u2019s counsel stated in her submission, she comes to Tax Court with imperfect evidence. Some purchase invoices were put into evidence. The appellant in many instances purchased goods simply based on a telephone call. In these instances, no supporting documents exists.\n[68] The other documents that should have been presented at trial, or at least evidence of their content, would be the CBSA remittance forms, showing how much GST was paid when purchased items came over the border. But for one instance, these forms were not present. This lack of evidence makes it very difficult to find in the appellant\u2019s favour.\n[69] The foreign supplier invoices in evidence did not show GST being paid. There is no documentation showing GST being paid, nor has evidence been provided of specific GST being paid that relates to an ITC claim. It is my conclusion, as I review the lack of evidence of this case, that I am unable to even allow a portion of the ITCs in issue.\n[70] For the reasons set out below, the lack of evidence from the appellant concerning the payment of GST by the non-registrants is fatal to their case.\nE. General Description Concerning Recovery of ITCs\n[71] Generally speaking, a business carrying on commercial activity can recover the GST or HST it incurs through ITCs. The effect is to make the transactions tax neutral.\n[72] As noted above, if either section 178.8 or section 180 applies, and the appellant is deemed to have paid the amount of tax paid or payable, the appellant would still need to meet specific evidentiary requirements to qualify for ITCs. These requirements are provided in the Act and in the ITC Regulations.[22] The relevant provisions for the purposes of determining the necessary documentation to qualify for ITCs are as follows:\n169 \u2026\nRequired documentation\n(4) A registrant may not claim an input tax credit for a reporting period unless, before filing the return in which the credit is claimed,\n(a) the registrant has obtained sufficient evidence in such form containing such information as will enable the amount of the input tax credit to be determined, including any such information as may be prescribed; and\n(b) where the credit is in respect of property or a service supplied to the registrant in circumstances in which the registrant is required to report the tax payable in respect of the supply in a return filed with the Minister under this Part, the registrant has so reported the tax in a return filed under this Part.\u201d[23]\nIn these Regulations,\n\u2026\nsupporting documentation means the form in which information prescribed by section 3 is contained, and includes\n(a) an invoice,\n(b) a receipt,\n(c) a credit-card receipt,\n(d) a debit note,\n(e) a book or ledger of account,\n(f) a written contract or agreement,\n(g) any record contained in a computerized or electronic retrieval or data storage system, and\n(h) any other document validly issued or signed by a registrant in respect of a supply made by the registrant in respect of which there is tax paid or payable;\n\u2026\nPrescribed Information\n(3) For the purposes of paragraph 169(4)(a) of the Act, the following information is prescribed information:\n(a) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is less than $30,\n(i) the name of the supplier or the intermediary in respect of the supply, or the name under which the supplier or the intermediary does business,\n(ii) where an invoice is issued in respect of the supply or the supplies, the date of the invoice,\n(iii) where an invoice is not issued in respect of the supply or the supplies, the date on which there is tax paid or payable in respect thereof, and\n(iv) the total amount paid or payable for all of the supplies;\n(b) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is $30 or more and less than $150,\n(i) the name of the supplier or the intermediary in respect of the supply, or the name under which the supplier or the intermediary does business, and the registration number assigned under section 241 of the Act to the supplier or the intermediary, as the case may be,\n(ii) the information set out in subparagraphs (a)(ii) to (iv),\n(iii) where the amount paid or payable for the supply or the supplies does not include the amount of tax paid or payable in respect thereof,\n(A) the amount of tax paid or payable in respect of each supply or in respect of all of the supplies, or\n(B) where provincial sales tax is payable in respect of each taxable supply that is not a zero-rated supply and is not payable in respect of any exempt supply or zero-rated supply,\n(I) the total of the tax paid or payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act and the provincial sales tax paid or payable in respect of each taxable supply, and a statement to the effect that the total in respect of each taxable supply includes the tax paid or payable under that Division, or\n(II) the total of the tax paid or payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act and the provincial sales tax paid or payable in respect of all taxable supplies, and a statement to the effect that the total includes the tax paid or payable under that Division,\n(iv) where the amount paid or payable for the supply or the supplies includes the amount of tax paid or payable in respect thereof and one or more supplies are taxable supplies that are not zero-rated supplies,\n(A) a statement to the effect that tax is included in the amount paid or payable for each taxable supply,\n(B) the total (referred to in this paragraph as the \u201ctotal tax rate\u201d) of the rates at which tax was paid or payable in respect of each of the taxable supplies that is not a zero-rated supply, and\n(C) the amount paid or payable for each such supply or the total amount paid or payable for all such supplies to which the same total tax rate applies, and\n(v) where the status of two or more supplies is different, an indication of the status of each taxable supply that is not a zero-rated supply; and\n(c) where the total amount paid or payable shown on the supporting documentation in respect of the supply or, if the supporting documentation is in respect of more than one supply, the supplies, is $150 or more,\n(i) the information set out in paragraphs (a) and (b),\n(ii) the recipient\u2019s name, the name under which the recipient does business or the name of the recipient\u2019s duly authorized agent or representative,\n(iii) the terms of payment, and\n(iv) a description of each supply sufficient to identify it.[24]\n[73] Put succinctly, ss. 169(4) provides that an ITC cannot be successfully claimed unless the registrant has obtained sufficient evidence as will enable the amount of the ITC to be determined. That simply does not exist in this case.\n[74] I have come to this conclusion, even in light of reviewing the recent decision of Fiera Foods[25], wherein the following was stated concerning 169(4):\n[278] Reading the words of paragraph 169(4)(a) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, the paragraph prohibits a person from claiming an input tax credit unless the person has, prior to claiming the input tax credit in a return, obtained sufficient evidence in such form containing such information (including any prescribed information) as enables the amount of the input tax credit to be determined.\n[279] The clear focus of the paragraph is not the form of the evidence as such, which is unspecified, but the requirement that the evidence include the information necessary to determine the amount of the input tax credit. This information includes any information prescribed by the Information Regulations.\n[280] The French version of paragraph 169(4)(a) makes this point more succinctly when it states:\n(4) L\u2019inscrit peut demander un cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants pour une p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration si, avant de produire la d\u00e9claration \u00e0 cette fin:\na) il obtient les renseignements suffisants pour \u00e9tablir le montant du cr\u00e9dit, y compris les renseignements vis\u00e9s par r\u00e8glement;\n[281] The French text simply requires that the person claiming the input tax credit obtain information (including prescribed information) sufficient to establish the amount of the input tax credit.[26]\n[75] Thus, the appellant must have obtained sufficient evidence to demonstrate the amount of ITCs claimed is correct. As noted above, that has not occurred in this matter.\n[76] What has been put in evidence is a portion of invoices. I have no indication as to what GST was paid to the Minister, if any, on these transactions. I do not accept that a review of the appellant\u2019s bank statements indicating money being paid to non-registrant foreign sellers is sufficient to calculate the ITCs.\n[77] The only complete record I have of the transactions in issue, as described in paragraph 38 above, indicates that the appellant claimed far more ITCs than he was entitled to. This is on only one transaction. However, it does indicate the importance of sufficient evidence to determine the amount of ITCs the appellant is entitled to.\n[78] I therefore must deny the appeal concerning the ITCs.\nF. Was the Minister Entitled to Reassess the Appellant for the Statute-Barred Years?\n[79] Under the Act, the Minister generally cannot reassess a taxpayer more than four years after the later of 1) the date in which a taxpayer was required to file a return under section 238 or 2) the day the return was actually filed.[27] However, subsection 298(4) of the Act provides an exception for statute-barred years where the taxpayer filed a waiver with respect to the year, committed fraud in making its return or \u201cmade a misrepresentation that is attributable to the person\u2019s neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d[28] The respondent admits that the reporting periods ending on April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011 are statute-barred.[29]\n[80] The language in this provision is nearly identical to the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply the same broad principles in determining whether the Minister is justified in reassessing a taxpayer in a statute-barred year.\n[81] We must determine whether the appellant made a \u201cmisrepresentation attributable to \u2026 neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\u201d The threshold to meet the misrepresentation requirement is low and it is generally met if a taxpayer made a false statement on their return.[30]\n[82] Citing Venne, the Court in Reluxicorp found that \u201c[t]here will be negligence where the respondent establishes that the appellant did not exercise reasonable care.\u201d[31] Similarly, \u201cthere will be carelessness if the person failed to make reasonable efforts to comply with the Act.\u201d[32] In MF Electric, the Court cited Regina Shoppers for the principle \u201cthat the care that must be exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct.\u201d[33] This standard is lower than what is required to establish gross negligence.[34]\n[83] Courts have consistently found that taxpayers cannot avoid being found negligent or careless merely because they relied on their accountant.[35]\n[84] The specific amounts in issue in the Statute-Barred Periods are:\nPeriod ending April 30, 2010\n- GST\/HST remittable as filed $63,753.41\n- ITCs as filed $64,755.20;\n- Net tax as filed was negative $1,001.79.\n- As a result of the audit adjustments, which I accept were correct, an additional GST of $5,363.68 should have been remitted;\n- The over claim of ITCs was $6,379.79. There was an additional ITC audit adjustment of $2,069.77.\n- The total audit adjustment was $13,813.24.\nPeriod ending April 30, 2011\n- GST\/HST remittable as filed $157,840\n- ITCs as filed $149,686;\n- Net tax as filed was $8,154.\n- As a result of the audit adjustments, which I accept were correct, an additional GST of $.25 should have been remitted;\n- The over claim of ITCs was calculated in two amounts $7,450.77 (from the US account), $9855.46 (from the RPW account) and an additional ITC adjustment of $10,977.71.\n- The total audit adjustment was $28,284.19.\n[85] I find that the appellant was, at a bare minimum, careless in the Statute-Barred Periods. I rely upon the following factors:\ni)No contemporaneous bookkeeping was performed. The methodology used by the appellant, involving a yearly calculation using bank statements, certainly would lead to an incorrect amount for both the GST\/HST that had to be remitted as well as the ITCs claimed;\nii)ITCs were claimed based on a 13\/113 calculation which lead to a vast over claim;\niii)No proper records were obtained to support the ITCs claimed.\n[86] Therefore I find that the appellant, in not keeping proper books and records, and using a methodology to calculate the ITCs that was plainly wrong, was negligent or careless. The Minister was therefore able to reopen the periods ending April 30, 2010 and April 30, 2011.\nG. Section 285 Penalty in the Amount of $161,953.00\n[87] Section 285 of the Act imposes penalties on taxpayers who \u201cknowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, makes or participates in, assents to or acquiesces in the making of a false statement or omissions in a return\u2026\u201d The quoted text and purpose of section 285 is nearly identical to the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act and courts apply the same general principles under both provisions.[36] The appellant does not bear the burden to \u201cdemolish\u201d the Minister\u2019s assumptions for the purposes of penalties under section 285 of the Act.[37]\n[88] The \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cgross negligence\u201d requirements under section 285 are not conjunctive and the Minister may meet its onus by establishing either requirement.[38] The Tax Court in Fiera Foods found that \u201c[a] \u2018false statement\u2019 is a statement in a return that is untrue and an \u2018omission\u2019 is something that is left out of a return.\u201d[39] To apply a section 285 penalty, the Minister must establish that the appellant made the false statement 1) knowingly or in circumstances amounting to 2) gross negligence.\n(i) Gross Negligence\n[89] The FCA found that unreported taxable income \u201cdoes not inevitably lead to a conclusion that a gross negligence penalty [or reopening a statute-barred year] is justified.\u201d[40] However, if the taxpayer does not provide a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy then a trial judge \u201ccan draw the inference that the taxpayer was grossly negligent\u201d if 1) such an inference is reasonable and 2) the evidence does \u201cnot allow for a different explanation.\u201d[41]\n[90] The following principle from Venne was affirmed by the SCC in Guindon: \u201c\u2018Gross negligence\u2019 must be taken to involve greater neglect than simply a failure to use reasonable care. It must involve a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting, an indifference to as to whether the law is complied with or not.\u201d[42]\n[91] The burden \u201cis closer to the criminal onus under the Criminal Code than it is to a balance of probabilities.\u201d[43] The extent of a taxpayer\u2019s knowledge of business and tax matters is a factor in determining if they were grossly negligent.[44]\n(ii) Knowingly\n[92] To meet the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement, the Minister must establish that the taxpayer had \u201csubjective knowledge\u201d that it was making a false statement on a tax return. Because a taxpayer will typically not admit that it had knowledge that it was making a false statement, this requirement is often established by demonstrating that the taxpayer was either wilfully blind or that it ought to have known that the return contained false information. The Court in Torres outlined the following principles to apply in determining if a taxpayer was wilfully blind:\na) Knowledge of a false statement can be imputed by wilful blindness.\nb) The concept of wilful blindness can be applied to gross negligence penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the Act and it is appropriate to do so in the cases before me.\nc) In determining wilful blindness, consideration must be given to the education and experience of the taxpayer.\nd) To find wilful blindness there must be a need or a suspicion for an inquiry.\ne) Circumstances that would indicate a need for an inquiry prior to filing, or flashing red lights as I called it in the Bhatti decision, include the following:\ni) the magnitude of the advantage or omission;\nii) the blatantness of the false statement and how readily detectable it is;\niii) the lack of acknowledgment by the tax preparer who prepared the return in the return itself;\niv) unusual requests made by the tax preparer;\nv) the tax preparer being previously unknown to the taxpayer;\nvi) incomprehensible explanations by the tax preparer;\nvii) whether others engaged the tax preparer or warned against doing so, or the taxpayer himself or herself expresses concern about telling others.\nf) The final requirement for wilful blindness is that the taxpayer makes no inquiry of the tax preparer to understand the return, nor makes any inquiry of a third party, nor the CRA itself.[45]\n[93] In determining whether penalties should apply, I cannot find any reason why any individual reporting period before me is distinct from another. Therefore, I will deal with all the reporting periods as one. I rely upon the following facts, to support my conclusion that penalties were properly assessed in this instance:\nThe appellant admitted that they used an improper method to calculate GST. This lead to a trial admission by the appellant that ITCs were over claimed in the amount of $292,194 (see paragraph 66)[46] and an overall denial of ITCs in this decision amounting to $474,816;\nThe appellant underreported GST\/HST remittable for the periods in the amount of $114,032.56;\nBased upon the adjustments made to the appellant\u2019s general ledger concerning the GST\/HST payable, I find the appellant had knowledge that these amounts were underreported and did not correct these errors;\nThe net tax adjustment of $646,784.27 is material, and relates directly to the appellant improperly claiming ITCs and underreporting GST\/HST payable;\nProper books and records were both not obtained (in many instances) or were not kept to support the GST\/HST filings;\nMr. Bajwa, the sole shareholder and president of the appellant, was an experienced businessperson, educated, and had the services of an accountant. Related to this finding, the appellant has been involved in the importing and exporting of goods for a number of years, and most likely has knowledge of the tax consequences of these transactions;\nI did not find Mr. Bajwa\u2019s evidence concerning his lack of knowledge concerning the accounting of the appellant\u2019s business, or its reporting requirements, to be credible;\nThe evidence of Mr. Bajwa was that he made no inquiry of his accountant, who prepared his taxes, to understand his return, or his tax obligations. Furthermore no evidence was lead that he made any inquiries of third parties to inform himself;\nIn the only instance of documentation showing the amount of GST paid in bringing goods into Canada, the appellant\u2019s agent vastly understated the value of the goods as being $322 instead of $10,761.73 US;\n[94] Based on the above factors, I find that the appellant was either willfully blind or grossly negligent.\n[95] The appellant has relied upon a case, Bandula, for the proposition that the respondent has not properly plead the correctness of the computation of the penalty amount. Much the same as was found in Bandula, I am satisfied that the Minister sufficiently pleaded the subsection 163(2) penalties and indicated how and why same would apply. Further, any deficiency in those pleadings or failure to lead evidence ought not to have been reserved by the appellant until reply submissions.[47]\nV. CONCLUSION\n[96] Based upon the reasons set out above, the Appeal is denied in its entirety. Costs are payable by the appellant.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 14th day of March 2024.\n\u201cR.

Introduction [1] Mr. Volodymyr Bykov (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals reassessments of his 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cReassessments\u201d). The Reassessments reduced or denied certain expenses that the Appellant claimed in respect of his employment during his 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cTaxation Years\u201d).\n[2] The Appellant filed a separate notice of appeal for each of the four Taxation Years. With the consent of the parties, the four appeals were heard together on common evidence.\n[3] The legal issues raised by these appeals result from the distinctions in the Income Tax Act (Canada)[1] (the \u201cITA\u201d) between income from a source that is an office or employment and income from a source that is a business. Subsection 8(2) expressly limits the amounts that may be deducted by a taxpayer in respect of an office or employment to the amounts that are permitted by section 8.\n[4] The parties agreed that the Appellant was employed by four separate employers in 2015 and three separate employers in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (individually, an \u201cEmployer\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cEmployers\u201d).[2] I confirmed with counsel for the Appellant that the Appellant was not taking the position that during the Taxation Years the Appellant was an independent contractor rather than an employee.\nII. The Facts [5] The Appellant testified on his own behalf. I found the Appellant to be a credible witness.\n[6] The Respondent did not call any witnesses.\n[7] The Respondent set out in the four Replies to the four Notices of Appeal filed by the Appellant the assumptions of fact made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) when reassessing each of the Taxation Years. Rather than repeating all of the assumptions of fact here, I have reproduced them in Appendices A to D of these reasons for judgment.\n[8] I must accept the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact as true unless the Appellant meets his evidentiary burden to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions.[3]\n[9] The Appellant testified that he is a visiting registered nurse who provides nursing services to individuals in their own home, or in a retirement or nursing home. The majority of the Appellant\u2019s patients are in palliative care.\n[10] During the Taxation Years, the Appellant provided nursing services six days one week and four days the next week on a rotating basis. Each week included two or three seven-hour night shifts during which the Appellant was on standby for patients that required urgent care during the night.\n[11] Each evening prior to a workday, the Employers would provide the Appellant with a schedule of the individuals that he was to visit the following day (I will refer to these individuals as \u201cpatients\u201d). The Appellant estimated that he visited between 10 and 30 patients during a day shift and that he worked on average of 40 to 45 hours per week plus the two to three seven-hour night shifts.\n[12] A visit to a patient could involve any of a number of nursing services provided by the Appellant depending on the needs of the patient. A visit could also involve consultation with one or more members of the patient\u2019s family.\n[13] The Employers paid the Appellant a fixed amount for each patient visit regardless of the nursing services provided by the Appellant. For example, the terms of employment with S.R.T. Med-Staff in Exhibit A-4 state under the heading \u201cWages, Benefits and Vacation\u201d:\nAs a nurse working in the community you are paid by the client visit at a rate of $36.00 per visit, less any applicable statutory and other deductions.\n[14] The Appellant lived in Bradford, Ontario and travelled from there to visit the patients. The Employers did not provide the Appellant with a place to work and required the Appellant to have a car, a cell phone and a home office with a fax machine and office supplies.\n[15] The Appellant testified that he maintained an office in his home that occupied most of the basement (the \u201chome office\u201d). The Appellant used the home office to hold telephone consultations with other medical professionals (e.g., doctors) regarding patients, to store medical supplies provided by the Employers, and to store the medical records of patients under the Appellant\u2019s care.\n[16] The Appellant stated that the patients\u2019 medical records were confidential and that he was required to store the records securely in an area of his home office with restricted access.\n[17] The Appellant submitted copies of the T2200 forms issued by the Employers for each of the Taxation Years (collectively, the \u201cT2200s\u201d).[4] The T2200 forms issued by Spectrum show home office use of 15 percent for all of the Taxation Years and the T2200 forms issued by S.R.T. Med-Staff show home office use of 30 percent for all of the Taxation Years. The T2200 forms issued by ParaMed show home office use of \u201c50%\u201d for 2015, \u201c<40%\u201d for 2016, \u201c40%\u201d for 2017 and \u201cless than 50%\u201d for 2018.\n[18] Section 5 of the T2200s indicate that ParaMed and Spectrum gave the Appellant a motor vehicle allowance, which the Appellant testified was less than the per kilometer amount accepted by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) as a reasonable automobile allowance. The Appellant stated that he deducted the difference as an employment expense.\n[19] Section 5 of the T2200 forms issued to the Appellant by Spectrum for the Taxation Years states that the Appellant\u2019s motor vehicle allowance was calculated on a per visit basis rather than a per kilometer basis. The allowances for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $8,008.80, $7715.35, $7,501 and $5,995.95, respectively. The T2200 forms indicate that these amounts were not included on the Appellant\u2019s T4s for the Taxation Years.\n[20] Section 5 of the T2200 forms issued by ParaMed for the Taxation Years states that the motor vehicle allowance was 0.38 cents per kilometer. The allowances for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were $502.51, $1,097.22, $651.01, and $369.67, respectively. Section 5 of the T2200 form for 2018 also identifies $5.30 as a fixed motor vehicle allowance that was included on the Appellant\u2019s T4 for that year.\n[21] On the T2200s, each Employer answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201cDid you require this employee to be away for at least 12 consecutive hours from the municipality and metropolitan area (if there is one) of your business where the employee normally reported to work?\u201d[5] and \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cDid you normally require this employee to travel to locations that were not your place of business or between different locations of your places of business, during the course of performing his or her employment duties?\u201d.[6]\n[22] The Appellant testified that because his wife\u2019s name was on the insurance policy the CRA allowed only one-half of the cost of his motor vehicle insurance even though his wife did not have a driver\u2019s licence. The Appellant did not submit evidence in support of the quantum of the motor vehicle insurance premium.\n[23] The Appellant testified that he maintained records of his employment activities and expenses including a time log showing the time spent performing his employment duties and a mileage log showing his motor vehicle use for employment. The Appellant testified that he provided the records to the CRA by registered mail.[7]\n[24] The Appellant did not provide the Court with a copy of any records or logs, and also did not provide the Court with documentary evidence regarding the sending of records to the CRA by registered mail. The Appellant testified that he received letters from the CRA stating that the CRA did not receive the records.[8]\n[25] The Appellant provided the Court with a copy of a T777 Comparative Summary of Employment Expenses that covered the Taxation Years.[9] The T777 form, in conjunction with the Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the form,[10] is evidence of the employment related expenses claimed by the Appellant for the Taxation Years, but it is not evidence in support of the quantum of those expenses.\n[26] In cross-examination, the Appellant agreed with counsel for the Respondent that his employment by the Employers did not require or involve the selling of property or the negotiating of contracts for the Employers.\nA. Position of the Parties (1) The Appellant [27] The Appellant submits that he was a commissioned employee because he was paid on a per patient visit basis and that he is entitled to deduct the expenses that he claimed for the Taxation Years.\n[28] With respect to the use of the home office, the percentages on the T2200s issued by the Employers add up to more than 50 percent and therefore the condition in paragraph 8(13)(a) is satisfied.\n(2) The Respondent [29] The Respondent submits that the Appellant was a salaried employee and denies the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to a deduction of expenses greater than the expenses allowed by the Reassessments.\n[30] The Appellant was not employed in connection with the selling of property or the negotiation of contracts and therefore the deductions permitted by paragraph 8(1)(f) do not apply to the Appellant.\n[31] Contrary to the position of the Appellant, the use of a home office must be determined for each office or employment and the percentage of use for each of the three separate employments in issue in these appeals cannot be aggregated.\n[32] All but one of the T2200s indicates home office use by the Appellant of less than 50 percent and the remaining form indicates home office use of exactly 50 percent in 2015. This use does not satisfy the condition in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i).\n[33] The Appellant received a non-taxable automobile allowance from ParaMed and Spectrum and the additional motor vehicle related amounts claimed by the Appellant were not deductible under section 8.\nIII. Analysis [34] Generally speaking, an individual that carries on a business is entitled to deduct any reasonable expense that is not on account of capital and that is incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business. In contrast, under subsection 8(2), an employee may deduct only those expenses that are permitted by section 8.\n[35] The provisions of the ITA that are relevant to these appeals are paragraphs 6(1)(b), 8(1)(f), (i), (h), (h.1) and (j) and subsections 8(2) and (13). I have reproduced these provisions in Appendix E to these reasons for judgment and will refer to them as required for clarity.\n[36] The Appellant submits that paragraph 8(1)(f) applies to the expenses he incurred in respect of his employment by the Employers. The introductory words of paragraph 8(1)(f) state the following condition that must be met for the paragraph to apply to the Appellant:\nwhere the taxpayer was employed in the year in connection with the selling of property or negotiating of contracts for the taxpayer\u2019s employer, and \u2026\n[37] The Appellant is a registered nurse who provides nursing services to patients and who is compensated for those services on a per patient visit basis. The Appellant acknowledged that he did not sell property or negotiate contracts for the Employers.\n[38] Based on the opening words of subparagraph 8(1)(f) read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense,[11] the Appellant does not qualify for the deductions permitted by that paragraph because during the Taxation Years the Appellant did not sell property or negotiate contracts for the Employers.\n[39] The technical notes issued in May 1991 that accompanied a proposed amendment of paragraph 8(1)(f)[12] state, in part:\nParagraph 8(1)(f) permits a commissioned salesperson to deduct amounts expended for the purpose of earning income from employment, where the salesperson was not in receipt of a non-taxable travel allowance and was required by the contract of employment to pay his or her expenses and carry on the duties of employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[40] The purpose of paragraph 8(1)(f) is to allow a salesperson to deduct expenses related to the activities of selling and negotiating contracts provided certain additional conditions are satisfied such as payment by commission. The fact that the Appellant was paid by the Employers on a per visit basis does not bring the Appellant within the scope of paragraph 8(1)(f). The Appellant\u2019s nursing duties are simply not the kind of employment duties contemplated by paragraph 8(1)(f).\n[41] Subparagraphs 8(1)(i)(ii) and (iii) allow a deduction for office rent and supplies consumed in the performance of an employment, respectively. The Appellant did not suggest that he paid office rent, and the supplies consumed by the Appellant in the performance of his nursing duties were provided by the Employers. Therefore, the only supplies that would fall under subparagraph 8(1)(i)(iii) are miscellaneous office supplies. The Appellant did not provide evidence of the quantum of expenditures on miscellaneous office supplies.\n[42] Even if an expenditure was proven and satisfied the requirements of paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i), the amount may not be deductible because of subsection 8(13). This is because subsection 8(13) provides that no amount is deductible under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i) unless specified conditions are met. Paragraph 8(13)(a) states:\nNotwithstanding paragraphs (1)(f) and (i),\n(a) no amount is deductible in computing an individual\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment in respect of any part (in this subsection referred to as the \u201cwork space\u201d) of a self-contained domestic establishment in which the individual resides, except to the extent that the work space is either\n(i) the place where the individual principally performs the duties of the office or employment, or\n(ii) used exclusively during the period in respect of which the amount relates for the purpose of earning income from the office or employment and used on a regular and continuous basis for meeting customers or other persons in the ordinary course of performing the duties of the office or employment;\n[Emphasis added.]\n[43] With respect to the Appellant\u2019s employment by each of the Employers, the condition in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) requires that he principally perform the duties of his employment at his home office.\n[44] The word \u201cprincipally\u201d is an adverb that is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online) to mean \u201cFor the most or greater part; in most cases; in the main; mostly.\u201d The word connotes an action that is greater than 50 percent of all relevant actions. This is the meaning adopted in the tax case law.[13]\n[45] The nature of the Appellant\u2019s employment activities\u2014caring for patients in their home, or in a nursing or retirement home\u2014strongly suggests that the greater part of the Appellant\u2019s employment activities do not take place at his home office. Rather, the Appellant\u2019s use of his home office is ancillary to and in support of the performance of his nursing duties at other locations.\n[46] This general observation is confirmed by the T2200s, which indicate home office use in respect of employment by Spectrum of 15 percent for all of the Taxation Years, home office use in respect of employment by S.R.T. Med-Staff of 30 percent for all of the Taxation Years, and home office use in respect of employment by ParaMed of \u201c50%\u201d for 2015, \u201c<40%\u201d for 2016, \u201c40%\u201d for 2017 and \u201cless than 50%\u201d for 2018.\n[47] Contrary to the position asserted by the Appellant, the \u201cprincipally\u201d requirement in subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) applies separately to each employment[14] and, therefore, the percentages shown on the T2200s cannot simply be added together. I note that even if the employments were addressed on an aggregate basis, based on the T2200s the total home office activity would always be 50 percent or less of all relevant activity because at no time does the percentage of home office activity for an Employer exceed 50 percent of total activity.\n[48] Subparagraph 8(13)(a)(ii) has two conditions. First, the home office must be used by the Appellant exclusively for the purpose of earning income from employment. Secondly, the home office must be used by the Appellant on a regular and continuous basis for meeting customers or other persons in the ordinary course of performing the Appellant\u2019s employment duties. The Appellant did not suggest that he satisfied the second condition and there is no evidence to indicate that the second condition was satisfied. Telephone conferences participated in by the Appellant from the home office do not qualify as using the home office to meet customers or other persons.\n[49] Based on the foregoing, even if the Appellant was entitled to a deduction for home office expenses under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (i), the deduction would be denied because the Appellant does not satisfy the requirements of either subparagraph 8(13)(a)(i) or 8(13)(a)(ii).\n[50] The remaining provisions in issue are paragraphs 8(1)(h), (h.1) and (j). Paragraph 8(1)(h) addresses travel expenses other than motor vehicle expenses, paragraph 8(1)(h.1) addresses motor vehicle expenses, and paragraph 8(1)(j) addresses the cost of acquiring a motor vehicle (i.e., interest and capital cost allowance).\n[51] Subparagraphs 8(1)(h)(i) and (ii) and subparagraphs 8(1)(h.1)(i) and (ii) state the following requirements for paragraphs 8(1)(h) and (h.1), respectively, to apply:\nwhere the taxpayer, in the year,\n(i) was ordinarily required to carry on the duties of the office or employment away from the employer\u2019s place of business or in different places, and\n(ii) was required under the contract of employment to pay the [8(1)(h): travel expenses] [8(1)(h.1): motor vehicle expenses] incurred by the taxpayer in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, \u2026\n[52] The Appellant clearly met these conditions. Under the terms of his employment by each of the Employers the Appellant was ordinarily required to travel throughout the GTA to see patients, to have a motor vehicle and to incur travel and motor vehicle expenses. While it is possible that the Appellant occasionally met patients at an Employer\u2019s place of business (e.g., a retirement home or nursing home operated by the Employer),[15] the Appellant was also required to meet patients in their homes in the ordinary course of his employment duties.\n[53] Under subparagraph 8(1)(h)(iii), paragraph 8(1)(h) does not apply to travel expenses if the Appellant received an allowance for the travel expenses that was not included in his income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(v), (vi) or (vii). The evidence indicates that the Appellant did not receive an allowance for travel expenses from any of the Employers. Consequently, the Appellant\u2019s reasonable travel expenses incurred by him in the performance of the duties of his employment by each of the Employers were deductible. I will address the quantum of such expenses at the conclusion of these reasons for judgment.\n[54] Under subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii), paragraph 8(1)(h.1) does not apply to motor vehicle expenses incurred by the Appellant if the Appellant received an allowance for the motor vehicle expenses that was not included in income because of paragraph 6(1)(b).\n[55] Subject to a parenthetical exception that does not apply to the Appellant, subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) excludes from the income of an employee \u201creasonable\u201d allowances received by an employee from the employer for travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment.\n[56] In Nicoll v. R., 2023 TCC 116, the Tax Court judge reproduced subparagraphs 6(1)(b)(vii) and (vii.1) and then observed:\n11 The above wording has been in effect since 1994 and applies to the 1990 taxation year and later. The retroactive amendment in 1994 specifically deleted the previous wording of \u201callowances (not in excess of reasonable amounts)\u201d from both subparagraphs 6(1)(b)(vii) and (vii.1) and replaced it with \u201creasonable allowances\u201d.\n12 In explanation of the amendment, the May 30, 1991 Department of Finance Technical Notes say:\nThese paragraphs are amended, applicable to the 1990 and subsequent taxation years, to provide that reasonable allowances in respect of travelling expenses and motor vehicle expenses will be excluded in computing the income of an individual from an office or employment. Thus allowances that are not reasonable, rather than only those in excess of a reasonable allowance, may be included in income. In these circumstances, the taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction with respect to travelling expenses under paragraph 8(1)(f) or (h).\n[Footnotes omitted.]\n[57] The question of whether an allowance is reasonable or is not reasonable is a question of fact.[16] The word \u201creasonable\u201d in the sense employed in subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) connotes that an amount must be within limits of what it would be rationale or sensible to expect in the circumstances.\n[58] In Mohammad v. Canada, [1998] 1 F.C. 165 (FC-AD), the Court observed:\n[28] When evaluating the reasonableness of an expense, one is measuring its reasonableness in terms of its magnitude or quantum. Although such a determination may involve an element of subjective appreciation on the part of the trier of fact, there should always be a search for an objective component. \u2026\n[59] Neither the Respondent nor the Appellant argued that the motor vehicle allowances provided to the Appellant by ParaMed and Spectrum were not reasonable and in the absence of evidence demonstrating manifest unreasonableness I see no reason to address that question of fact.\n[60] In addition to the factual question of reasonableness, subparagraph 6(1)(b)(x) deems an allowance not to be reasonable where the measurement of the use of the motor vehicle used to calculate the allowance is not based solely on the number of kilometers driven for the relevant employment, and subparagraph 6(1)(b)(xi) deems an allowance not to be reasonable where the taxpayer receives both an allowance in respect of the use of a motor vehicle and is reimbursed in whole or in part for expenses in respect of that use.\n[61] With the exception of the fixed allowance of $5.30 in 2018, the motor vehicle allowance provided by ParaMed for each of the Taxation Years was not included in the Appellant\u2019s income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1). Accordingly, the Appellant was not entitled to a deduction of motor vehicle expenses incurred in respect of his employment by ParaMed for any of the Taxation Years.\n[62] The fact that the CRA may have considered a greater per kilometer allowance than that provided by ParaMed reasonable does not entitle the Appellant to deduct the difference under paragraph 8(1)(h.1) when the allowance was not included in income because of subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) and there is no evidence that the allowance was not reasonable.[17]\n[63] According to the T2200 forms issued to the Appellant by Spectrum, the motor vehicle allowance provided to the Appellant by Spectrum was not based solely on the number of kilometers driven by the Appellant in connection with his employment by Spectrum. Consequently, the motor vehicle allowance was not excluded from the Appellant\u2019s income by subparagraph 6(1)(b)(vii.1) because it was deemed not to be reasonable by subparagraph 6(1)(b)(x).\n[64] However, section 5 of the T2200 forms issued by Spectrum to the Appellant for the Taxation Years indicates that Spectrum did not include the motor vehicle allowance on the T4s it issued to the Appellant for the Taxation Years. Also, the Appellant did not report this allowance as income, the CRA did not challenge the Appellant\u2019s filing position and based on the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the Respondent appears to have assumed that the allowance was not taxable.\n[65] Paragraph 8(1)(h.1) states that a taxpayer that meets the conditions recited in subparagraphs 8(1)(h.1)(i) and (ii) is entitled to deduct motor vehicle expenses incurred for travelling in the course of employment:\n\u2026 except where the taxpayer\n(iii) received an allowance for motor vehicle expenses that was, because of paragraph 6(1)(b), not included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the year \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[66] In this case, the motor vehicle allowance provided by Spectrum to the Appellant for each of the Taxation Years was not included in computing his income because Spectrum failed to include the allowance on the T4s issued to the Appellant for the Taxation Years and the Appellant did not otherwise report the amount as income.\n[67] Because based on the evidence[18] subparagraph 6(1)(x) clearly did apply to the allowance provided by Spectrum, paragraph 6(1)(b) did not apply to exclude the allowance from the Appellant\u2019s income. Consequently, the limitation in subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii) did not apply to the motor vehicle expenses incurred by the Appellant in respect of his employment by Spectrum.\n[68] Although this is a peculiar result, it is nevertheless clearly the result mandated by the words of subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii) when read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense.\n[69] The result is not inconsistent with the purpose of the exclusion in subparagraph 8(1)(h.1)(iii), which is to disallow a deduction for a motor vehicle expense if the taxpayer has received an allowance that is not included in the income of the taxpayer because of paragraph 6(1)(b). This purpose is not thwarted if the allowance is not included in income for some other reason.\n[70] In order to be entitled to a deduction under paragraph 8(1)(j), the Appellant must be entitled to a deduction under paragraph 8(1)(f), (h) or (h.1). I have found that the Appellant was entitled to deduct the travel expenses that he incurred in respect of his employment by each of the Employers. I have also found that the Appellant was entitled to deduct the motor vehicle expenses that he incurred in respect of his employment by S.R.T. Med-Staff and Spectrum. Consequently, the Appellant is entitled to deduct the amounts identified in paragraph 8(1)(j) for the motor vehicle used by the Appellant in the performance of his employment duties for the Employers.\n[71] The foregoing analysis of the law does not address the quantum of the expenses allowed to the Appellant under paragraphs 8(1)(h), (h.1) or (j). The quantum of the expenses that may be deducted by the Appellant is impacted not only by the actual amount of the expenses incurred by the Appellant but also by issues such as whether any of the Appellant\u2019s travel was between his home and a place of work.[19] Evidence such as receipts, travel logs and motor vehicle logs would allow the Court to address such issues.\n[72] Unfortunately, apart from the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he maintained records and logs that he provided to the CRA, and that he incurred the expenses indicated on the T777 comparative summary entered as Exhibit A-17, the Appellant provided no evidence supporting the quantum of the expenses incurred by him that qualify for deduction under paragraph 8(1)(h), (h.1) or (j). I raised this issue with counsel for the Appellant during argument and counsel conceded that there was no evidence on the record regarding the quantum of the expenditures incurred by the Appellant.[20]\n[73] The Appellant\u2019s evidence regarding the type of records he maintained and the quantum of expenses that he claimed is not the sort of evidence that challenges the Minister\u2019s assumptions of fact regarding the quantum of the employment expenses he incurred during each of the Taxation Years. Consequently, I have no choice but to accept the Minister\u2019s assumptions as to the quantum of those expenses. As recently stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dirani:\n[5] In denying the appellant\u2019s claims, the Minister relied on the following assumptions: the company\u2019s assets exceeded its liabilities upon its dissolution, the appellant did not make an investment in the company, and the company did not owe any uncollectible debt to the appellant.\n[6] The Tax Court determined that the appellant had failed to demolish these assumptions. The Tax Court judge carefully reviewed the evidence before it (Oral Reasons at pages 3-5), and found that the appellant had not submitted any evidence upon which it could conclude that he had either advanced money to the company or incurred any bad debt (Oral Reasons at pages 10-11).\n\u2026\n[12] The expiry of the time periods prescribed in subsection 230(4) of the Act and section 5800 of the Regulations do not shield or immunize taxpayers from the evidentiary burdens they face in Tax Court proceedings. To hold otherwise would undermine the integrity of our self-assessing tax system. Maintaining books and records is an ongoing obligation in a self-assessing system and the appellant\u2019s failure to do so also made it impossible for him to meet the evidentiary burden on him to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions.\n[74] The failure of the Appellant to present evidence challenging the assumptions of fact made by the Minister regarding the quantum of the Appellant\u2019s travel and motor vehicle expenses leads inexorably to the conclusion that the Appellant has failed to satisfy the burden of proof placed on the Appellant to establish to a balance of probabilities the facts that show the Reassessments to be wrong.\n[75] For the foregoing reasons, the appeals by the Appellant of the Reassessments are dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 14th day of March 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

For the first 9 years that it owned the condominium unit, the Appellant rented it to third parties under long-term leases. However, for most of the last 14 months that it owned the condominium unit, the Appellant leased the property under a number of short-term leases through the Airbnb platform. The question before the Court is whether, in such a situation, the sale of the condominium unit was subject to GST\/HST.\n[2] The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts (the \u201cASF\u201d) and a joint book of documents. The parties agreed that the documents included in the joint book of documents were authentic true copies of the original documents and agreed on the truth of the contents of the documents. On the basis of this agreement, I entered the book of documents as Exhibit AR-1.[1]\n[3] Neither party called a witness during the hearing.\nSummary of Facts\n[4] The Appellant is registered for GST purposes under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, C. E-15 (the \u201cGST Act\u201d). It is an annual filer, with a reporting period ending on May 31 of each year. It is owned equally by brothers David and Dean Ross, who are the only shareholders and directors of the Appellant.\n[5] On February 29, 2008, the Appellant purchased a used condominium unit located at 2204-179 George Street, Ottawa (the \u201cCondominium\u201d).\n[6] Between February 2008 and February 2017, the Appellant leased the Condominium to persons who signed a contiguous series of long-term leases. Each lease exceeded 60 days. The last lease expired in February 2017.\n[7] Beginning on February 25, 2017 and ending in April of 2018, the Appellant listed the Condominium on the Airbnb platform and rented out the property through a series of short-term leases. The Appellant realized gross revenue from the short-term leases of $11,200 in 2017 and $43,179 in 2018.\n[8] The Appellant\u2019s final Airbnb reservation was for a stay of 31 nights ending February 26, 2018.\n[9] On December 12, 2017, the Appellant listed the Condominium for sale. On January 24, 2018, the Appellant entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with MLJFS Holdings, an arm\u2019s-length purchaser, for the Condominium. The sale closed on April 11, 2018.\n[10] Neither the Appellant nor the purchaser remitted GST in respect of the sale of the Condominium.\n[11] When assessing the Appellant for its annual GST reporting period between June 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018, the Minister assessed the Appellant $77,079.64 as GST\/HST collectable on the sale of the Condominium.\nThe Relevant Law and the Issues to be Decided by the Court\n[12] The question before the Court is whether the sale of the Condominium was subject to GST under Division II of the GST Act. Section 165 levies the Division II tax.\n[13] Subsection 165(1) imposes Division II tax at the rate of 5% on the recipient of a taxable supply that is made in Canada. Subsection 165(2) provides that if the taxable supply is made in a participating province, the rate of tax is increased by the tax rate for that province. The tax levied under each of subsections 165(1) and 165(2) is levied on the value of the consideration for the supply.\n[14] The Condominium is situated in Ontario; therefore, under subsection 142(1) and section 144.1, the sale of the Condominium was made in Canada and was made in a participating province, namely Ontario. As a result, if the sale was a taxable supply, then it was subject to tax at the 13% HST rate applicable to supplies made in Ontario.\n[15] The sale of the Condominium was clearly a supply, since supply is defined in subsection 123(1) as the provision of property or a service in any manner, including sale.\n[16] The issue before the Court is whether the sale was a taxable supply. Taxable supply is defined in subsection 123(1) as a supply made in the course of a commercial activity. Commercial activity is defined in subsection 123(1). Paragraph (c) of the definition states that a commercial activity means \u201cthe making of a supply (other than an exempt supply) by the person of real property of the person, including anything done by the person in the course of or in connection with the making of the supply\u201d.\n[17] The Appellant\u2019s sale of the Condominium was a supply of real property of the Appellant. Therefore, it was made in the course of a commercial activity unless the sale of the Condominium was an exempt supply.\n[18] Exempt supplies for purposes of the GST Act are set out in Schedule V of the Act. Part I of Schedule V exempts various supplies of real property. The relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is section 2 of Part I of Schedule V.\n[19] The relevant portion of the section reads as follows:\n2. A particular supply by way of sale of a residential complex or an interest in a residential complex made by a particular person who is not a builder of the complex or, if the complex is a multiple unit residential complex, an addition to the complex, unless\n(a) the particular person claimed an input tax credit in respect of the last acquisition by the person of the complex or in respect of an improvement to the complex acquired, imported or brought into a participating province by the person after the complex was last acquired by the person; or \u2026[2]\n[20] This section will apply to the sale of the Condominium if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the sale of the Condominium was the sale of a residential complex;\n-the Appellant was not a builder of the Condominium; and\n-the Appellant did not claim an input tax credit in respect of the last acquisition by the Appellant of the Condominium or in respect of an improvement to the Condominium.\n[21] The term builder of a residential complex is defined in subsection 123(1). The parties have agreed that the Appellant is not a builder for purposes of this definition. There are no facts before the Court that would suggest that the Appellant was a builder of the Condominium for purposes of the definition.\n[22] Paragraph 21 of the ASF states that the Appellant claimed input tax credits in respect of the tax paid on the purchase of furniture in December of 2016 and on the purchase of the service of painting in January 2017. The ASF states at paragraph 22 that the Appellant did not claim any input tax credits with respect to the purchase of or improvement to the Property.\n[23] These paragraphs are inconsistent if, as a question of fact, the painting that occurred in January of 2017 constituted an improvement to the Condominium within the meaning of the definition of improvement in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act. I do not have any facts before me that would allow me to determine whether the painting constitutes an improvement. However, during the hearing, the Respondent and the Appellant conceded that whatever painting occurred at the Condominium, it did not constitute an improvement for purposes of the GST Act.\n[24] In addition, it is not clear to me how the Appellant could claim input tax credits in respect of property and services that it acquired for consumption or use in the course of supplying the Condominium under a long-term residential lease. As I will discuss, such a supply constitutes an exempt supply.\n[25] In summary, there are no facts before me that would lead me to question the concession made by the parties that the Appellant did not claim any input tax credits with respect to the purchase of or improvements to the Condominium.\n[26] The only issue before the Court is the remaining condition that must be satisfied before the sale of the Condominium will be considered an exempt supply: the sale of the Condominium must constitute the sale of a residential complex.\n[27] Residential complex is defined in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act. The relevant portions of that definition for the purpose of this appeal, are as follows:\n\u201cresidential complex\u201d means\n(a) that part of a building in which one or more residential units are located, together with\n(i) that part of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land immediately contiguous to the building that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building as a place of residence for individuals, and\n(ii) that proportion of the land subjacent to the building that that part of the building is of the whole building,\n(b) that part of a building that is\n(i) the whole or part of a semi-detached house, rowhouse unit, residential condominium unit or other similar premises that is, or is intended to be, a separate parcel or other division of real property owned, or intended to be owned, apart from any other unit in the building, and\n(ii) a residential unit,\ntogether with that proportion of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land subjacent or immediately contiguous to the building that is attributable to the unit and that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence for individuals,\n(c) the whole of a building described in paragraph (a), or the whole of a premises described in subparagraph (b)(i), that is owned by or has been supplied by way of sale to an individual and that is used primarily as a place of residence of the individual, an individual related to the individual or a former spouse or common\u2011law partner of the individual, together with\n(i) in the case of a building described in paragraph (a), any appurtenances to the building, the land subjacent to the building and that part of the land immediately contiguous to the building, that are reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building, and\n(ii) in the case of a premises described in subparagraph (b)(i), that part of any common areas and other appurtenances to the building and the land subjacent or immediately contiguous to the building that is attributable to the unit and that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the unit,\n\u2026\nbut does not include a building, or that part of a building, that is a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house or other similar premises, or the land and appurtenances attributable to the building or part, where the building is not described in paragraph (c) and all or substantially all of the leases, licences or similar arrangements, under which residential units in the building or part are supplied, provide, or are expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than sixty days;\n[28] Under this definition, the Condominium will be a residential complex if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the Condominium is either a residential unit or a residential condominium unit; and\n-the exclusion at the end of the definition does not apply to the Condominium.\n[29] The Condominium is a residential unit. Residential unit is defined, in part, in subsection 123(1) to mean a condominium unit.\n[30] The Condominium is also a residential condominium unit under the definition in subsection 123(1) provided that it is a residential complex.\n[31] The Condominium will constitute a residential complex provided that the general exclusion in the definition of residential complex does not apply to the Condominium. This exclusion will apply to the Condominium if:\n-the Condominium is that part of a building that is a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house or other similar premises;\n-the building in which the Condominium is located is not described in paragraph (c) of the definition; and\n-all or substantially all of the leases, licences or similar arrangements, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[32] The building in which the Condominium is located is not described in paragraph (c) of the definition. That paragraph only applies to a building or condominium owned by an individual.\n[33] The Appellant argues that the exclusion does not apply to the Condominium for two reasons. First, the Condominium is not a hotel, motel or other similar premises. Second, if the Condominium is a hotel, motel or other similar premises, then the all or substantially all test contained in the exclusion does not apply to the supplies of the Condominium.\n[34] A provision that is relevant when determining whether the exclusion in the definition of residential complex applies to the Condominium is the change-in-use rule for real property contained in subsection 206(2).\n[35] Subsection 206(2) apples when a registrant did not acquire real property for use as capital property in its GST commercial activities and then begins, at a particular time, to use the property as capital property in its commercial activities.[3] The subsection reads as follows:\n(2) Beginning use in commercial activities For the purposes of this Part, where a registrant last acquired real property for use as capital property of the registrant but not for use in commercial activities of the registrant and the registrant begins, at a particular time, to use the property as capital property in commercial activities of the registrant, except where the registrant becomes a registrant at the particular time, the registrant shall be deemed\n(a) to have received, at the particular time, a supply of the property by way of sale; and\n(b) except where the supply is an exempt supply, to have paid, at the particular time, tax in respect of the supply equal to the basic tax content of the property at the particular time.\n[36] This subsection will apply in respect of the Condominium if the following conditions are satisfied:\n-the Appellant last acquired the Condominium for use as capital property in GST non-commercial activities;\n-the Appellant began, at a particular time, to use the Condominium as capital property in its commercial activities; and\n-the Appellant did not become a registrant at the particular time.\n[37] If the subsection applies, then the registrant is deemed, at the time that it began to use the Condominium in commercial activities, to have received a supply of the Condominium by way of sale and, except where the supply is an exempt supply, to have paid GST equal to the basic tax content of the property.\n[38] Generally speaking, the basic tax content is the tax paid by the registrant on the acquisition of the property and on any improvements to the property, provided that such tax was not recovered by way of rebate, refund or remission.\n[39] The ASF states that the Appellant was a GST registrant at the time that it acquired the property and retained that status throughout the relevant period.\n[40] The Appellant acquired the Condominium on February 29, 2008 for use as capital property. Capital property is defined in subsection 123(1) as property that is capital property under the Income Tax Act. The Condominium would clearly be capital property under that Act.\n[41] The evidence before me is that on February 29, 2008, the Appellant acquired the Condominium for use in non-GST commercial activities. In particular, the Appellant acquired the Condominium to make exempt supplies that were long-term residential leases.\n[42] Section 6 of Part I of Schedule V of the GST Act exempts the supply of a residential unit, such as the Condominium, by way of lease, licence or similar arrangement for the purpose of its occupancy as a place of residence or lodging by an individual, where the period throughout which continuous occupancy of the complex or unit is given to the same individual under the arrangement is at least one month.\n[43] Paragraph 8 of the ASF states that each of the Appellant\u2019s leases of the Condominium between February 2008 and February 2017 were to persons who each signed a contiguous series of long-term residential leases, with each lease exceeding 60 days. As a result, each of these supplies was an exempt supply. Therefore, the Appellant did not acquire the Condominium on February 29, 2008 for use in commercial activities.\n[44] On February 25, 2017, the Appellant listed the Condominium on the Airbnb platform for lease as a short-term lease. Tab 6 of Exhibit AR-1 shows that between March of 2017 and April of 2018, the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of lease on numerous occasions for periods of less than one month. Most of the supplies were for fewer than seven nights, with many for only one night. Such supplies were not exempt supplies since they were for periods of less than one month. The short-term leases were taxable supplies of real property.\n[45] As noted previously, a commercial activity includes the making of any supply of real property, other than an exempt supply. Paragraph 141.1(3)(a) provides that to the extent that a person does anything (other than make a supply) in connection with the establishment of a commercial activity of the person, the person is deemed to have done that thing in the course of commercial activities of the person.\n[46] It appears from the ASF that the first step that the Appellant took to establish the commercial activity of leasing the Condominium on short-term leases was the listing of the Condominium on the Airbnb website on February 25, 2017. Under paragraph 141.1(3)(a), the Appellant was deemed to have listed the Condominium in the course of its commercial activities. By offering the Condominium for short\u2011term lease on February 25, 2017, the Appellant began to use the Condominium in the course of its commercial activities on that date. Since the Appellant made such supplies in the course of its commercial activities, they constituted taxable supplies.\n[47] As a result, unless subsection 206(2) is subject to another section, the change\u2011in-use rules in subsection 206(2) applied to the Appellant on February 25, 2017, the particular time that the Appellant began to use the Condominium in commercial activities.\n[48] Therefore, assuming that subsection 206(2) applies, the Appellant was deemed under paragraph 206(2)(a) to have received a supply of the Condominium on February 25, 2017 by way of sale.\n[49] Paragraph 206(2)(b), which deems tax to be paid equal to the basic tax content, has no application. Paragraph 4 of the ASF states that the Condominium was a used condominium at the time that it was purchased by the Appellant. I assume this means that the Appellant did not pay GST when it acquired the Condominium. This was confirmed during the hearing by counsel for the Appellant. In such a situation, the basic tax content of the Condominium was zero on February 25, 2017.\n[50] The Appellant argues that subsection 206(2) does not apply because of the application of section 197. Section 197 limits the application of the change-in-use rules in subsections 206(2), (3), and (5), subsection 207(2), and subsections 208(2) and (3) to situations where the change in use is 10% or more.\n[51] Section 197 reads as follows:\nInsignificant changes in use \u2014 For the purposes of subsections 206(2), (3) and (5), 207(2) and 208(2) and (3), where in any period\n(a) beginning on the later of\n(i) the day a registrant last acquired or imported property for use as capital property of the registrant, and\n(ii) the day subsection 206(3) or (5), 207(2) or 208(3) last applied to the property, and\n(b) ending at any time after that day,\nthe extent to which the registrant changed the use of the property in commercial activities of the registrant is less than 10% of the total use of the property, the registrant shall be deemed to have used the property throughout that period to the same extent and in the same way as the registrant used the property at the beginning of that period, unless the registrant is an individual who began in that period to use the property primarily for the personal use and enjoyment of the individual or a related individual.\n[52] One of the situations where section 197 will apply to a change in use of real property is the situation where, between the time that a registrant last acquired the real property and a specific point in time, the extent to which the registrant changed the use of the real property is less than 10%. If the section applies in this situation then, for purposes of subsection 206(2) (and the other specified change-in-use rule for real property), the change in use is ignored. If the registrant is a corporation, it is deemed to have used the real property throughout the period to the same extent and in the same way as the registrant used the property at the time that it acquired the real property.\n[53] The Appellant argued that section 197 applies to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017.\nDisposition of Appeal\n[54] The issues before the Court are the application of the real property change\u2011in\u2011use rules, specifically subsection 206(2) and section 197, and the application of the definition of residential complex contained in subsection 123(1).\n[55] There is no dispute with respect to the relevant facts. The issues are purely matters of statutory interpretation.\n[56] In Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, [4] the Supreme Court of Canada identified the \u201ctextual, contextual and purposive\u201d principle as the principle that is to be used when interpreting the Act. At paragraph 10 of its reasons, the Court explained the principle as follows:\n[10] \u2026 The interpretation of a statutory provision must be made according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words play[s] a dominant role in the interpretive process. On the other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role. The relative effects of ordinary meaning, context and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, but in all cases the court must seek to read the provisions of an Act as a harmonious whole.\nChange-in-Use Rules\n[57] I will first address the application of the real property change-in-use rules to the Condominium.\n[58] The Appellant argued that when applying section 197, one looks to the period beginning on the date that the Appellant acquired the Condominium (February 29, 2008) and ending on the date that the Condominium was sold (April 11, 2018). The Appellant noted that during these 3,694 days of ownership, the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of taxable short-term leases for 366 days. On this basis, during the time that the Appellant owned the Condominium, it was used 9.9% of the time in commercial activities. As a result, section 197 applied, and the change-in-use rule in subsection 206(2) did not apply to the Condominium during the period that it was owned by the Appellant.\n[59] Section 206 contains rules whose primary purpose is to cause an increase or decrease in input tax credits when there is a change in use of capital real property. The section applies to registrants who are not individuals and to public sector bodies that file a section 211 election. The section applies to the Appellant, a corporation.\n[60] In most instances, subsection 206(2) applies to a GST registrant who, at the time that it acquired the real property, intended to use the real property exclusively in the making of exempt supplies. In such a situation, the registrant is not entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST that it paid on the acquisition of the real property, since it did not acquire the real property for use in its commercial activities. However, if the registrant begins to use the real property in its commercial activities, then subsection 206(2) allows the registrant to claim, at the time that it begins to use the real property in its commercial activities, an input tax credit. The input tax credit is based on the GST that the registrant paid on the acquisition of the real property, and the extent to which it is now using the real property in its commercial activities.\n[61] This is accomplished by deeming the registrant, for purposes of the GST Act, to have repurchased the property at the time of the change in use and to have paid tax at that time equal to the tax that it paid on the acquisition of the real property that was not previously recovered by way of rebate, refund or remission (the basic tax content of the property).\n[62] The remaining subsections of section 206 provide similar rules for situations where a registrant that is using real property in its commercial activities increases or decreases the extent to which it is using the real property in its commercial activities, or the registrant ceases to use real property in its commercial activities.\n[63] It is clear from the wording of the section 206 change-in-use rules, that the change-in-use rules apply at the point in time that a change in use occurs. It is at the time of each change in use that a supply is deemed to occur and that the amount of any additional input tax credit or the amount that the registrant is required to pay in respect of a previous claimed input tax credit is determined.\n[64] This can be seen from the wording of section 206. Subsection 206(2) applies to a registrant who begins, at a particular time, to use the real property as capital property in its commercial activities. Subsection 206(3), which deals with increases in use in commercial activities, applies where the registrant increases, at a particular time, the use of the real property in commercial activities. Subsection 206(4), which deals with ceasing to use the real property in commercial activities, applies where a registrant begins, at a particular time, to use the real property exclusively for non-commercial purposes. Subsection 206(5), which deals with reduction in the use of real property in commercial activities, applies where the registrant reduces, at a particular time, the use of the real property in commercial activities.\n[65] In summary, the change-in-use rules look to a change in use that occurs at a specific point in time and, on the basis of the extent of the change in use that occurs at that point in time, deem a supply to have been made or received. It is the extent and nature of the change in use that occurs at a particular point in time that determine which of the various subsections of section 206 apply.\n[66] Section 206 applies each time a change in use occurs. For example, if on day 1 a registrant acquires real property for use exclusively in exempt activities and then, on day 10, changes the use of the real property to 30% usage in commercial activities, subsection 206(2) applies on the date of the change in use. If on day 20, the registrant increases the use in commercial activities to 50%, then subsection 206(3) will apply on day 20. If on day 50, the use of the real property in commercial activities is reduced to 15%, subsection 206(5) will apply to the registrant on day 50.\n[67] Section 197 works with section 206 to limit the application of section 206 to individual changes in use that cumulatively are at least 10%. This saves the registrant the administrative costs of having to account for insignificant changes in use.\n[68] When determining whether, for the purposes of subsections 206(2), (3) and (5), a change in use of 10% or more has occurred at a particular point in time, section 197 looks at the changes in use that occurred during the period beginning on the later of the day the registrant last acquired the real property and the day subsection 206(3) or (5) applied and ending at any time after that date.\n[69] If, as is the case in this appeal, subsections 206(3) and (5) have never applied, the relevant period begins on the day that the registrant last acquired the real property and ends at any time after this date.\n[70] Section 197 refers to all the changes in use that occurred during this period. It accumulates the changes in use until such time as the total of the changes in use that have occurred since the time the real property was acquired is 10% or higher. This means that section 197 will only apply if the cumulative change in use of the real property beginning on the day the registrant last acquired the real property is less than 10%. Section 197 ceases to apply on the day that the cumulative change in use is 10% or higher. At this point in time, section 206 will apply to the change in use.\n[71] In the current appeal, the issue is whether section 197 applied to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017, when the Appellant began to use the Condominium 100% in commercial activities.\n[72] Clearly, section 197 did not apply. During the period beginning on the day that the Appellant acquired the Condominium (February 29, 2008) and ending on the date of the change in use (February 25, 2017), the cumulative change in use was 100%.\n[73] The Appellant asks the Court to only consider a period beginning on the day that the Appellant acquired the Condominium and ending on the day that it sold the property. This position ignores the very specific wording of section 197. Further, such an interpretation would defeat the purpose of section 206 by ignoring all changes in use that occurred while a registrant owned real property.\n[74] Since section 197 did not apply to the change in use of the Condominium that occurred on February 25, 2017, then, as discussed previously, the change\u2011in\u2011use rules in subsection 206(2) applied to the Condominium on February 25, 2017, the particular time that the Appellant began to use the Condominium 100% in commercial activities. As a result, the Appellant was deemed under paragraph 206(2)(a) to have received a supply of the Condominium on February 25, 2017 by way of sale.\nApplication of Exempting Provision\n[75] The primary issue before the Court is whether the sale of the Condominium on April 11, 2018 was a taxable supply or an exempt supply. The answer to this question will depend on whether the Condominium was, at the time of the sale, a residential complex.\n[76] As noted previously, since the Condominium was a residential unit at the time of sale, it was also a residential complex, unless the general exclusion in the definition of residential complex applied to the Condominium.\n[77] The Respondent argued that the exclusion applied to the Condominium at the time of sale. The Appellant argued that the exclusion did not apply since the Condominium was not part of premises that were similar to a hotel or motel and the all or substantially all test included in the definition was not satisfied.\n[78] I will first address the Appellant\u2019s argument that the Condominium was not similar premises to a hotel or motel.\n[79] The Respondent correctly noted that when determining whether the exclusion applies, one must consider all of the words in the definition of residential complex. The exclusion refers to premises that are a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house, a lodging house and other similar premises.\n[80] The question before the Court is whether the Condominium, at the time that it was sold, was similar premises to a hotel, a motel, an inn, a boarding house and a lodging house. The answer to that question is yes.\n[81] At the time of sale, the Appellant was offering the Condominium for short\u2011term lease on the Airbnb platform and was in fact leasing it for periods as short as one night. The Condominium was leased on a furnished basis with the Appellant paying all heating, air conditioning and electricity costs. Since the Court was not provided with the Airbnb listing, it is not clear what other amenities were provided to the lessee. However, the evidence before me was that the Appellant did provide Wi-Fi access as part of the short-term lease.\n[82] In my view, a Condominium being leased in such a manner is similar premises to a hotel, motel, an inn, a boarding house, or a lodging house.\n[83] Collectively, hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses and lodging houses are premises that are regularly supplied as accommodations to third parties on a short\u2011term basis for a fee.\n[84] The short-term accommodations provided in a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house and lodging house are normally furnished accommodations. Rooms and suites in a hotel, motel or inn are supplied with heat, electricity and, in many instances, air conditioning.\n[85] The definition refers to a wide range of accommodations. A hotel or a motel may be a single room or a suite. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary defines a lodging house as being equal to a rooming house and defines a rooming house as a house or building divided into furnished rooms or apartments. When one considers all of the types of physical accommodations provided in a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house or lodging house, it is clear that similar premises include a furnished condominium that is leased on a short-term (or even long-term) basis.\n[86] The Appellant argued that the Condominium was not similar to a hotel or a motel since it did not have a restaurant or otherwise provide food to the lessee. This argument assumes that all hotels and motels have restaurants. I have no evidence before me to support such a conclusion. Further, the fee charged by most hotels or motels for a room or a suite only covers the cost of the room or suite; it is not a fee for food. It is the guest\u2019s decision whether they want to purchase food from the hotel\/motel.[5]\n[87] Having found that the Condominium was similar premises to a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house and lodging house, I must now address the all or substantially all test that is set out in the exclusion. Specifically, I must determine whether, at the point in time that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[88] The Appellant argues that the all or substantially all test does not refer to a specific period when the test should be applied. Counsel for the Appellant argued that there is no \u201ctimestamp\u201d that says that the all or substantially all test applies to leases in a specific period such as a reporting period, the last year of ownership or the last month of ownership. The Appellant argues that the test should be applied over the entire ownership period.\n[89] The Appellant argues that the test is not met since, between February 29, 2008 (the date the Appellant acquired the Condominium) and April 11, 2018 (the date the Appellant sold the Condominium), all or substantially all of the leases of the Condominium provided for periods of continuous possession of at least 60 days. This is because the Condominium was leased 100% on a long\u2011term basis between February 29, 2008 and February 25, 2017.\n[90] I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s argument. The definition of residential complex contains no time stamp because the definition does not require a time stamp. The determination is not made over a period of time. The determination of whether the all or substantially all test applies is made based on the use of the Condominium at the time that the Condominium was sold.\n[91] When determining, under the GST Act, whether a taxable or exempt supply has been made, it is important to recognize that the tax levied under the GST Act is a value\u2011added tax that is levied on individual supplies. The application of the tax must be determined for each individual supply. This determination is made at the time that the supply is made. Specifically, it is at the time that the supply is made that one determines the recipient of the supply, whether the specific supply is a taxable supply or an exempt supply, whether the supply is made in Canada, whether the supply is made in a participating province, and the consideration for the supply.\n[92] As a result, the Court must determine whether, at the time of the sale of the Condominium, the Appellant made an exempt supply or a taxable supply.\n[93] This determination is dependent on the exempting provision in section 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the GST Act. The application of this provision is dependent on whether, at the moment that the Appellant sold the Condominium, namely, on April 11, 2018, the Condominium was a residential complex as that term is defined in subsection 123(1) of the GST Act.\n[94] This requires the Court to determine whether, at the time that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases under which the Condominium was being supplied at that point in time provided or were expected to provide for periods of continuous possession or use of less than 60 days.\n[95] The answer is clearly yes. At the time of sale, the Condominium was only being leased under short-term leases. All such leases were for less than 60 days; most were for only a few days. Therefore, on the day that the Appellant sold the Condominium, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[96] At the time that the Appellant supplied the Condominium by way of sale, the Condominium was not a residential complex since it was similar premises to a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house or lodging house and, at the time of sale, all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[97] Even if I were to accept the Appellant\u2019s argument, it would lead to the same result.\n[98] The Appellant was deemed under subsection 206(2) to have acquired the Condominium on February 25, 2017. Therefore, between the last time that the Appellant, for purposes of the GST Act, acquired the Condominium (February 25, 2017) and the date that it sold the property (April 11, 2018), the Appellant only used the property to make short-term taxable supplies by way of leases for periods of less than 60 days. At no point in time during this period was the Condominium a residential complex as defined in subsection 123(1) since all or substantially all of the leases, under which the Condominium was supplied during this period, provided, or were expected to provide, for periods of continuous possession of less than 60 days.\n[99] Since the Condominium was not, at the time that it was supplied by way of sale, a residential complex, the supply by way of sale was not an exempt supply under section 2 of Part I of Schedule V to the GST Act. It was a taxable supply of real property.\n[100] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 15th day of March 2024.\n\u201cS.

Overview\n[1] This matter involves a motion made by the Appellant for costs in this appeal to be determined as a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs pursuant to section 147 of the Rules of the Tax Court of Canada (General Procedure).\n[2] The appeal from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d) for the Appellant\u2019s 2000 and 2001 taxation years was dismissed with costs in favour of the Respondent on March 19, 2021 (2021 TCC 23). The trial judge retired in December 2022.\n[3] On April 13, 2023, the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d) set aside the decision of this Court with costs in favour of the Appellant (2023 FCA 78) (the \u201cFCA decision\u201d). The matter is thus once again before this Court but solely for the determination of costs based on written representations.\n[4] By way of background, the Appellant had implemented a structure (known as a \u201ctower structure\u201d) to acquire a US corporation and the funding for that acquisition involved a series of steps including a loan from the Appellant to a US affiliate.\n[5] The Appellant received and included in income the interest paid on its loan by the US affiliate and \u201cclaimed a deduction under subsection 20(12) of the withholding taxes paid to the US Government on this interest\u201d (para. 7, FCA decision).\n[6] As summarized by the FCA (paras. 9 and 11), the issue was whether the US withholding taxes paid by the Appellant were deductible in computing its income or whether the exception set out in subsection 20(12) was applicable.\n[7] The exception set out in subsection 20(12) of the Act excluded any tax that could \u201creasonably be regarded as having been paid by a corporation in respect of income from a share of the capital stock of a foreign affiliate of the corporation.\u201d\nThe Tax Court had concluded that the exception applied but the FCA determined that it did not and allowed the appeal with costs.\nII. The Law and General Principles\n[8] In General Electric Capital Canada Inc., v. Canada, 2010 TCC 490, Justice Hogan explained that \u201cthe purpose of section 147 of the Rules [is] to give a judge the discretion to move away from the Tariff in order to provide fair and reasonable relief in the circumstances - with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B\u201d (para. 28).\n[9] Justice Hogan referred to Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc., 2002 FCA 417 (para. 10), where Justice Rothstein had indicated that the Court should be satisfied, having regard to the factors set out in subsection 147(3), that there are adequate reasons for departing from Tariff.\n[10] In CIBC World Markets Inc. v. The Queen, 2019 TCC 201, Justice Bocock indicated that he was not inclined to depart from Tariff since it \u201cexists as a default compensatory measure\u201d (paras. 23-24). He awarded costs equal to double the Tariff, given the \u201cnovel nature of the issue owing to the lack of jurisprudence.\u201d\n[11] In the recent decision of Nixon v. The King, 2024 TCC 4, Justice MacPhee noted that \u201csection 147 of the Rules gives the Court broad discretion in awarding costs\u201d and that subsection 147(3) \u201cprovides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to consider in exercising its discretionary power to award costs beyond the Tariff amounts\u201d (para. 5).\n[12] Justice MacPhee then turned to the decision of Hillcore Financial Corporation v. The King, 2023 TCC 144, where Justice Lafleur had provided the following summary of the general principles on costs:\n8. The general rule is that costs should be \u201ccompensatory and contributory\u201d and \u201cnot punitive\u201d (see Grenon v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 89, at para 12). Further, an award of costs is generally not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party (see Velcro Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 273, [Velcro], at para 29).\n9. \u2026\n10. The broad discretion of the Court to award costs should not be exercised in an arbitrary manner but must be exercised on a principled basis; further, the quantum of costs must be reasonable and also determined on a principled basis (The Queen v. Lau, 2004 FCA 10, at para 5; The Queen v. Landry, 2010 FCA 135, at paras 22 and 54; Guibord v. Canada, 2011 FCA 346, at para 10 The King v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133, at para 32).\n11. Subsection 147(3) of the Rules provides a list of factors the Court should consider in exercising its discretion to award costs pursuant to subsection 147(1) of the Rules. However, none of the factors listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules are determinative and as such, the Court should consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion (Velcro, supra , at paras 12-13). As indicated by this Court in Velcro, the Tariff is \u201c... a reference point only should the Court wish to rely upon it\u201d (at para 8).\n12. The relevant parts of the Rules read as follows:\n147 (1) The Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.\n\u2026\n(3) In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,\n(a) the result of the proceeding,\n(b) the amounts in issue,\n(c) the importance of the issues,\n(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,\n(e) the volume of work,\n(f) the complexity of the issues,\n(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,\n(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,\n(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,\n(i)improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii)taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,\n(i.1) whether the expense required to have an expert witness give evidence was justified given\n(i) the nature of the proceeding, its public significance and any need to clarify the law,\n(ii) the number, complexity or technical nature of the issues in dispute, or\n(iii) the amount in dispute; and\n(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n\u2026\n14. This Court is not limited to applying the Tariff. Subsection 147(4) of the Rules provides that the Court \u201c... may fix all or part of the costs with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B and, further, it may award a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs\u201d.\n15. The case law has held that \u201c...increased costs beyond the Tariff are not tied to exceptional circumstances, such as misconduct, malfeasance or undue delay\u201d (see Duffy v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 135 [ Duffy ], at para 21; Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v. The Queen, 2013 TCC 275, at para 4; Ford Motor, supra , at para 7). Indeed, recent case law held that a greater recognition of the work involved in tax litigation should be a factor to consider in awarding costs (see Duffy, supra, at para 21; Blackburn Radio Inc. v. the Queen, 2013 TCC 98, at paras 14-15; Invesco Canada Ltd v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 92, at paras 17 and 25; Spruce Credit Union v. The Queen, 2014 TCC 42, at para 52; Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 15, at\n[13] A proper approach to the determination of costs involves a review of the various applicable factors in section 147(3). If the Court finds there are adequate reasons for departing from Tariff, it must then determine whether costs should be awarded at the lower or upper range established by case law. See Canada v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133 (\u201cBowker\u201d)\n[14] In Zeller Estate v. the Queen, 2009 TCC 135 (\u201cZeller Estate\u201d), Justice D. Campbell had quoted the 2008 edition of Mark Orkin\u2019s The Law of Costs, (2nd Ed.), Vol. 1 (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2008) in support of the proposition that \u201c[t]raditionally the degree of indemnification represented by partial indemnity costs has varied between 50% and 75% of solicitor and client or substantial indemnity costs\u201d (para. 9).\n[15] That assertion was repeated in later decisions including Ford Motor Company Limited v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 185 (para. 7) (\u201cFord Motor\u201d) and Dickie v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 327 (paras. 2 and 27) (\u201cDickie\u201d). The FCA Appeal affirmed Dickie, noting that the trial judge had properly exercised his discretion in awarding costs of 50%, having reviewed the factors set out in subsection 147(3) (2014 FCA 40, para. 6).\n[16] In the more recent decision of Fareed Ahamed TFSA v. The King, 2023 TCC 177, Justice Spiro reviewed a number of decisions going as far back as 2010 (not including Zeller Estate, Ford Motor or Dickie) concluding that the range for an award of costs could be as low as 20% with a mid-range of 35-50%.\n[17] In particular, there was no suggestion that the range should be 50% - 75% of solicitor-client costs. This is not surprising. As noted by the FCA in Bowker, \u201cthere is no consensus in the field as to the breadth of the range, particularly at the upper end\u201d (para. 19).\n[18] It may thus be concluded that an award of costs in the range of 50% - 75% is not the norm in this Court and that such an award should be reserved for exceptional circumstances, taking into consideration the fact that \u201csubstantial indemnity costs\u201d are defined in subsection 147(3.5) of the Rules as \u201c80% of solicitor-client costs.\u201d\n[19] In the end, the determination of costs is always discretionary.\nIII. Position of the Appellant\n[20] The Appellant acknowledges that the trial lasted only one day but claims that the issue was complicated. It is argued that this \u201ccomplexity\u201d was evidenced by the differing analysis and result reached by this Court and the FCA on the correct interpretation of subsection 20(12) of the Act.\n[21] The Appellant submits that a lump sum award of $274,073 (plus applicable taxes) is warranted and appropriate. This would reflect 75% of a counsel fee of $325,431, as more fully described in the bill of costs, plus 100% of a counsel fee of $30,000 for the preparation of the costs submissions in this motion.\n[22] The Appellant states that the range of partial indemnity cost awards in this Court is between 50% and 75% of solicitor-client costs or substantial indemnity costs. The Appellant argues that it should be entitled to 75% of its counsel fee based on its review of the factors set out in subsection 147(3) of the Rules.\nIV. Position of the Respondent\n[23] The Respondent claims that the Appellant\u2019s range of partial-indemnity costs of between 50-75% of solicitor-client costs is an error and that this range is empirically not a \u201cusual\u201d, \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d range for party-party costs.\n[24] The Respondent also adds that it is improper to identify a numerical range for an award of costs and then to calibrate that amount by reviewing the factors set out in subsection 147(3), as indicated by the FCA in Bowker.\n[25] The Respondent argues that that a proper award of costs would be along the lines of CIBC World Markets, supra, because it similarly involved a streamlined litigation process leading to a one-day hearing that addressed a single legal issue. The Court awarded costs equal to Tariff plus $6,000 or approximately double the Tariff for a one-day hearing.\n[26] The Respondent argues that an award of costs at double the Tariff of $4,800 or $9,600 would be an appropriate award of costs in this appeal.\n[27] The Respondent also argues that the Appellant\u2019s claim for 100% of its costs associated with this motion is \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201cnot justifiable\u201d. The Respondent argues that each party should assume their own costs, but that if costs are awarded to the Appellant, they should be offset against the costs payable to the Appellant in the underlying appeal. In the alternative, if costs are awarded to the Appellant for the motion, the Respondent requests an opportunity to make additional submissions since the Minister presented an offer to settle costs on September 27, 2023.\nV. Analysis\n[28] The Court now turns to a review of the applicable factors.\n[29] 147(3)(a) - Result of the proceedings: The parties both agree that the Appellant was entirely successful in its appeal. They also agree that where a single issue determines the outcome of a proceeding, this factor stands for the principle that the successful party is entitled to costs but it does not affect the quantum.\n[30] I agree and would view this factor as neutral.\n[31] 147(3)(b) - Amount in Issue: The Appellant sought to restore its claimed deduction of approximately $8.9 million paid in US withholding taxes in 2000 and 2001. It claims that the amounts in issue were significant and justify an increased award.\n[32] The Respondent does not agree indicating that the \u201camount at issue\u201d is to be considered in the context of a particular taxpayer and the transaction to which it relates. In Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd. v. R, 2013 TCC 275, six percent of the proceeds of a major transaction was found to be minimal and costs were limited to Tariff.\n[33] In this instance, the underlying loan from the Appellant to the US affiliate was US $266,670,000 (CA $396,000,000) and the amount at issue represented approximately 2.2% of that amount. For the 2000 taxation year, the Appellant sought to deduct CA $3,808,456, representing approximately 10% of the interest payment of CA $37,876,850 from which it was withheld. A similar percentage applied for 2001.\n[34] Given the amount at issue in the context of the entire transaction, I agree with the Respondent that this factor should be given little weight.\n[35] 147(3)(c) - Importance of the Issue: The Appellant claims that the appeal involved an interpretation and application of subsection 20(12) and that this required counsel to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the entire foreign tax credit and deduction regime. The Respondent admits that the decision may have precedential value for a potentially small class of future litigants using a similar \u201ctower structure\u201d.\n[36] Given the precedential nature of the FCA decision, as admitted by the Respondent, I agree with the parties that this factor would justify an increase from Tariff.\n[37] 147(3)(e) - Volume of Work: The Appellant claims that it voluntarily produced all documents requested by the Respondent as the parties worked towards an agreed statement of facts and made substantial efforts in drafting and pushing forward the necessary factual record in advance of trial. This simplified the procedure, time and issues at trial. The Appellant relies on Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. v. R, 2016 TCC 258 and argues that their efforts should lead to an increased costs award.\n[38] The Respondent acknowledges that this factor is among the most important of the subsection 147(3) factors but argues that the list of documents was brief (under 30 documents), that neither party conducted examinations for discovery, that no witnesses were called including expert witnesses or reports. The trial lasted one day and the appeal turned on the interpretation of a single legislative provision. The Respondent submits that the appeal did not have the hallmarks of a high workload appeal and thus this factor should be neutral.\n[39] The Respondent adds that even if this factor should weigh in favour of the Appellant, the evidence provided is insufficient to determine the nature and extent of the services provided or if the fees were reasonable. More specifically, the Respondent argues that only the services of counsel exceeding 5% of the total time, should be considered and secondly, that time billed for work done prior to the institution of the appeal should be discounted.\n[40] On balance, I agree with the Respondent and find that this factor is neutral.\n[41] 147(3)(f) \u2013 Complexity of the Issues: The Appellant contends that applying subsection 20(12) to the so-called \u201ctower structure\u201d involving a web of hybrid entities was both challenging and complex.\n[42] The Appellant argues that the facts and legal issues applied to those concepts were extremely complicated and that they had to distinguish themselves from FLSmidth Ltd. v. The Queen, 2023 FCA 160 (\u201cFLSmidth\u201d), relied upon by the Crown as being dispositive of the issues raised in this appeal. The trial judge, and later the FCA, agreed with the Appellant, finding that while the structure and transactions implemented by the Appellant were similar, that decision was not dispositive of the appeal. The Appellant submits that this supports an increased award of costs.\n[43] The Respondent argues that the appeal involved only a single issue and that the Appellant is attempting to paint a complicated picture by arguing that the background facts were complex. The Respondent points to the agreed statement of fact and lack of factual complexity that was not the subject of evidence or argument at trial except insofar as they shaped the legal issues in dispute. The Minister believes this issue should be neutral.\n[44] On balance, I find that the complexity of the facts and the issue in the appeal weigh in favour of an increase of costs in favour of the Appellant.\n[45] 147(3)(g) \u2013 Conduct that shortened or lengthened unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding: The Appellant claims that their efforts to resolve the factual matrix through an agreed statement of facts allowed the parties to forego various litigation steps. This shortened the trial and supports an increased award of costs.\n[46] The Respondent agrees that the appeal proceeded on an expeditious basis but argues that they cooperated in the preparation of the partial agreed statement of facts. It argues that the Appellant\u2019s approach would mark a departure from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence and would fundamentally contradict the spirit of the Rules. The Respondent indicates that recent case law has treated subsection 143(3)(g) overwhelmingly as a tool for addressing blameworthy or discreditable behaviour but not as a tool for rewarding a party\u2019s efficiency in the conduct of litigation.\n[47] The Respondent argues that where parties cooperate to streamline the proceedings, costs should be at or near Tariff, as discussed in Appelwood Holdings Inc. v. The Queen, 2019 TCC 34 (para. 12) and Bank of Montreal v. the Queen, 2021 TCC 3 (para. 22).\n[48] The Respondent adds that in any event, there is a lack of detail in the invoices and time entries and no clear indication of the work performed on the agreed statement of facts, such that the Court could not reasonably draw a conclusion even if the request for costs were justifiable.\n[49] I agree with the Respondent that this factor is neutral as both parties took steps to expedite the litigation process leading to a one-day hearing. A high degree of cooperation between the parties should not lead to a higher award of costs for the successful party nor a lower costs award for the unsuccessful party.\n[50] 147(3)(d), (h), (i), (i.1) and (j): The parties agree that these factors are not relevant.\nVI. Conclusion\n[51] In light of the above, the Court is inclined to depart from Tariff based on its finding that the factors described in paragraphs 147(3)(c) and (f) are engaged.\n[52] As acknowledged by the Respondent, the issue addressed by the trial Judge was important. The Appellant successfully distinguished its own facts from those in the leading decision of FLSmidth and the resulting FCA Decision has precedential value albeit for a narrow set of facts involving similar structures.\n[53] Secondly, despite the Respondent\u2019s position that there was only \u201ca single issue\u201d and the matter was not \u201cfactual complexity\u201d given the partial agreed statement of facts, the Court finds that the interpretation of subsection 20(12) and its application to the facts was such that it justifies an increased award of costs.\n[54] The Court agrees with the Respondent that an award of 75% of the Appellant\u2019s solicitor-client costs is unjustified in view of the jurisprudence of this Court, as summarized above.\n[55] The Respondent has suggested that an award equal to double the Tariff would be appropriate for a one-day hearing without any witnesses. The Court finds that this would be inadequate given its consideration of the two factors noted above.\n[56] All things considered, the Court concludes that an award at the lower end of the scale or 20% of solicitor-client costs (plus applicable taxes) would be more appropriate. The Court finds that such an award would adequately contribute to the Appellant\u2019s costs keeping in mind that an award of costs is not intended to fully compensate a party for costs incurred. Such an award would also be in keeping with the notion that an award is discretionary, that it need not be tied to exceptional circumstances but that it should recognize the work accomplished.\n[57] With respect to the Appellant\u2019s request for costs of this motion fixed at $30,000, the Respondent states that it attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of an offer to settle but received no response. It has requested an opportunity to make additional submissions should the Court choose to award costs for the motion.\n[58] In the interest of finality, the Court is inclined to deal with the matter without further submissions from the Respondent. In so doing, it must consider the Appellant\u2019s overall success in this motion. In light of that, the Court fixes the costs of the motion at $6,000 (plus applicable taxes).\n[59] The Appellant is therefore awarded lump sum costs of $65,086 plus an additional $6,000 for this motion for a total of $71,086 (plus applicable taxes).\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 18th day of March 2024.\n\u201cGuy Smith\u201d\nSmith J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 38\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2017-1901(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nEMERGIS INC. v.

Yuan\u201d\nYuan J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 39\nDate: 20240326\nDocket: 2019-2367(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nRAJESH RAMROOP,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nYuan J.\n[1] This is an appeal of a reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year, as reflected in a Notice of Reassessment dated March 14, 2016.\n[2] Under the reassessment, the Minister of National Revenue adjusted the Appellant\u2019s liability under Part I of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (\u201cITA\u201d) to deny the Appellant\u2019s claim for a charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) in respect donations made in 2006 to The Mega Church International (\u201cMega Church\u201d), which claim the Minister had previously allowed when assessing his 2006 tax return as filed.\n[3] The normal reassessment period for the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year lapsed in 2010. Consequently, the Minister relied on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[4] In light of the foregoing, the two issues in the appeal were:\nWhether the Minister was entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period, and\nIf the Minister was allowed to reopen the 2006 tax year, whether the Appellant was entitled to the tax credits claimed in respect of donations made to Mega Church.\nI. BACKGROUND\n[5] In years around 2006, the Appellant was a car mechanic who was employed with different auto dealerships in southern Ontario. He also lived in various residences in southern Ontario during that time.\n[6] When filing his 2006 tax return, he claimed $6,000 as a charitable donation made to Mega Church, attaching a tax receipt issued by the donee.\n[7] In each of the three years prior to 2006, he made charitable donations that were, in aggregate, similar to the $6,000 amount that he claimed in 2006 as donations to Mega Church. The Minister reassessed the Appellant to fully disallow the prior charitable donation claims, primarily on the basis that the Appellant was unable to provide proof of the transfer of funds to the charitable organizations in the course of the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s audit of his tax returns for those years. (The Appellant\u2019s pattern of claiming around $6,000 of charitable donations in his tax return for a year and having the Minister reassess to fully disallow the claim was repeated in 2008 to 2010; however, any details surrounding the donations for this period and the Minister\u2019s basis for denying these tax credit claims were not put into evidence by either party.)\n[8] For the 2003 to 2006 period, the Appellant reported annual employment earnings in the range $30,447 to $47,538 and annual net income in the range $22,936 to $47,538.\nII. BURDEN OF PROOF\n[9] It is well-established that the Minister has the onus of proof when seeking to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period. However, if the Minister satisfies that onus and the substance of the dispute is about entitlement to a claimed tax credit, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to demonstrate that the taxpayer is entitled to the amounts claimed: see, for example, Calphin, 2015 TCC 158.\n[10] At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant\u2019s representative made a tactical decision to not enter any evidence as part of his case, apart from the cross-examination of witnesses called by the Respondent. In doing so, the Appellant\u2019s representative essentially restricted the Appellant\u2019s case in this appeal to the Court\u2019s determination on the issue of whether the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 tax year beyond the normal reassessment period; this is because the Appellant would have the burden of proving entitlement to the tax credits if the Minister was successful on the first issue and yet the Appellant was not entering any evidence to show that he had met the requirements for claiming the charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for a donation to Mega Church.\nIII. REASSESSMENT BEYOND THE NORMAL REASSESSMENT PERIOD\n[11] The relevant portions of paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA provide, as follows:\n(4) Assessment and reassessment \u2013 The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year \u2026 payable under this Part by a taxpayer \u2026 except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act \u2026\n[12] Where the Minister seeks to rely on a taxpayer misrepresentation in a tax return to open up the tax year, the Minister must show that (i) there was a misrepresentation made in the tax return, and (ii) the misrepresentation was attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\n[13] In this appeal, the Minister argued that there were two misrepresentations that the Appellant made in his 2006 tax return which would justify reopening the 2006 tax year. The first alleged misrepresentation is the claim for a charitable donation of $6,000 to Mega Church on Schedule 9 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 return for the purpose of receiving a tax credit. The second alleged misrepresentation is the Appellant\u2019s failure to include the name and address for Mr. Nathaniel Okoroafor in box 490 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 return for the purpose of identifying the professional who prepared the return.\n(1) Claiming $6,000 Charitable Donation in T1 Return\n[14] The Minister\u2019s principal argument in support of reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period was that the evidence supports a finding that the Appellant did not make any payments in 2006 to Mega Church and, therefore, the Appellant made a misrepresentation by neglect, carelessness or wilful default in his 2006 T1 return by claiming to have made a $6,000 donation despite not having made a payment or otherwise given value to that entity in the year.\n[15] At the hearing, there was little direct evidence concerning the payments that the Appellant was relying on to support his claim for the $6,000 donation to Mega Church in 2006. That small amount of evidence was given by the Appellant, who was called as a witness as part of the Respondent\u2019s case.\n[16] The Appellant\u2019s testimony was that he attended the Mega Church location on several occasions with his brother in 2006 and, each time, he provided the pastor with a donation by way of a bank draft payable to Mega Church.\n[17] When listening to the Appellant\u2019s testimony, it was my impression that he likely did not try to refresh his memory in the days leading up to the hearing with respect to his 2006 donations to Mega Church and the surrounding circumstances. I was prepared to accept that his failure to accurately recount some of the secondary details was attributable to the passage of time combined with the possibility that he did not bother to refresh his memory. For example, he gave testimony that he received tax receipts from Mega Church contemporaneously with each payment, but this testimony is at odds with the fact that he attached to his 2006 tax return a single Mega Church receipt for $6,000. I reconciled this discrepancy on the basis that the Appellant could have become confused in the course of his testimony between the tax receipts issued by a charitable organization and the purchaser\u2019s copy of a bank draft.\n[18] However, I was unable to resolve the inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s testimony concerning the frequency of his attendance at the Mega Church location, having regard for the impact the differing versions would have had on the number and face amount of bank drafts purchased by the Appellant for payments to Mega Church in 2006 and the number of times he would have had to attend his bank to purchase same.\n[19] The Respondent initially asked the Appellant on the witness stand whether he attended Mega Church weekly and, in response, the Appellant said that the visits were not weekly but probably twice a month. This corresponds to approximately 24 Mega Church visits in 2006. Later, he testified that he attended the Mega Church location three times in 2006 and, on each occasion, he gave Mega Church a donation of $2,000 by way of bank draft. This was his version of events through most of his testimony. However, when the Respondent returned to the topic of Mega Church later in questioning, the Appellant testified that he attended Mega Church with his brother every Sunday; this would correspond to 52 visits in 2006.\n[20] If the Appellant attended the Mega Church on a semi-monthly basis as he initially testified, there would have been 24 bank drafts averaging $250 each. When he said that he attended Mega Church three times in 2006, he also testified that there were three bank drafts delivered for $2,000 each. And, if the Appellant attended Mega Church weekly as he later testified, there would have been 52 bank drafts with average amounts of $115 each. It is important to note that, in advance of each Mega Church visit, the Appellant would have had to go to his bank to purchase a bank draft for his next Mega Church visit.\n[21] I am unable to understand how it is possible for the Appellant to be testifying about his own Mega Church-related activities in 2006 and, in the same testimony, give evidence that suggests different versions of the same events. At one end, he would have attended at his bank on 52 occasions to purchase a bank draft of approximately $115 and, at the other end, he would have attended his bank on three occasions to purchase a bank draft of approximately $2,000. For this reason, I find the Appellant\u2019s testimony concerning his attendance at, and donations to Mega Church, to be neither credible nor reliable.\n[22] While I reject the Appellant\u2019s testimony about attending and making payments to Mega Church in 2006 for the reasons above, I am not satisfied that the rejection of the Appellant\u2019s evidence on the delivery of bank drafts to Mega Church on its own is sufficient to allow me to conclude that the Minister had established on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant did not make payments to Mega Church in 2006 of $6,000 in aggregate.\n[23] I recognize that there are additional evidentiary challenges when one is trying to prove a negative \u2013 in this case that payments alleged to have been made, were not actually made \u2013 but it strikes me that there may have been opportunities for the Respondent to enter evidence in this appeal towards making a prima facie case that the Appellant could not have donated $6,000 in aggregate to the Mega Church in 2006 based on an analysis of his known sources of funds and probable outlays in 2006, which is similar to the approach that the Minister uses in the case of net worth assessments. Perhaps the Respondent did not have the financial data to prepare such an analysis but, whatever the reason, the Respondent did not introduce evidence giving the Court the Minister\u2019s version of the Appellant\u2019s financial situation in 2006 and the improbability of him making $6,000 in donations to Mega Church in 2006.\n[24] The Respondent did put into evidence financial data from the Appellant\u2019s 2001 to 2011 tax returns and invited the Court to take into account patterns concerning the charitable giving reported in those returns to support a finding that the Appellant did not deliver $6,000 in bank drafts to Mega Church in 2006. More particularly, the Respondent drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the $6,000 amount of the Appellant\u2019s claimed donation to Mega Church in 2006 represented 12.62% of the Appellant\u2019s net income for the 2006 taxation year and that, for example, the charitable donations claimed in the years 2003 to 2005 (which were also disallowed by the Minister) represented the range of 17.77% to 26.16% of the Appellant\u2019s net income for those years. The Respondent spent considerable time going over this data when putting it into evidence and in the course of argument. Obviously, on its own, this is not evidence that directly supports the conclusion that the Appellant was unable to purchase $6,000 in bank drafts for payment to Mega Church in 2006, as the amount of the charitable donations claimed in 2006 and the other large donation years were still substantially less than the Appellant\u2019s net income for the year. In my view, statistical measures of the percentage of charitable giving in a year to net income for the year are useful audit tools for the Minister to identify the taxpayers who might be candidates to have their charitable donations more closely scrutinized. However, if the Respondent\u2019s point in all this was that the Appellant could not have the financial resources to make the payments to charities, then more evidence was required on where his 2006 income was going and precluding the possibility that the Appellant had other non-taxable sources of funds to make the donations.\n[25] The Respondent also invited me to consider the Appellant\u2019s failure to produce copies of the bank drafts or any relevant bank statements at the hearing and then draw an adverse inference from the fact that such documents were not put into evidence. The Respondent mostly emphasised the Appellant\u2019s failure to produce copies of bank drafts purchased in 2006 that were payable to Mega Church, together with the fact that the CRA had sent him correspondence in 2006 that insisted on proof of payment in connection with their audit of his charitable donations made in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and, therefore, he should have been on notice to obtain or retain copies of any bank drafts purchased to make donations to Mega Church in 2006. I presume that the Respondent wanted me to draw the adverse inferences that (i) copies of bank drafts payable to Mega Church were not produced because none were purchased, and (ii) the relevant bank statements for 2006 would not contain entries that would correspond to the purchase of bank drafts payable to Mega Church. I have decided that making those adverse inferences cannot be justified in the circumstances. First, the jurisprudence establishes that an adverse inference should only be drawn when the party having the burden of proof has made out a prima facie case (see: Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed.) (Toronto, ON: Lexis Nexis Canada, Inc., 2022), paragraph 6.511). In this case, the Minister had the burden of proof to show that the Appellant could not have made payments to Mega Church of $6,000 in aggregate in 2006 and I did not feel that the Respondent made out a prima facie case through the evidence on this point. Second, it would be inappropriate to draw an adverse inference in circumstances where the party against whose interest the inference would be drawn has a credible explanation for why the evidence was not provided. Here, the Appellant\u2019s explanation was that the documents do not exist because he did not retain them and the banks do not maintain records from so long ago. I would be more inclined to reject the Appellant\u2019s explanation of why he did not retain or obtain the banking-related records if the Respondent was able to show that there was an on-going correspondence exchange with the Appellant concerning the proof of payment for his 2006 charitable donation, well within the time frame during which banks would be expected to retain their client records for a 2006 transaction. However, that was not the nature of the evidence that the Respondent tendered in support of the position that the Appellant \u201cwas put on notice\u201d, so I do not consider the CRA\u2019s correspondence pertaining to the 2003, 2004, and 2005 audit to be relevant for purposes of making an adverse inference from his failure to produce copies of relevant bank drafts evidencing payment to Mega Church in 2006.\n[26] Finally, the Respondent asked me to find that the Appellant likely did not make $6,000 in payments to Mega Church in 2006 because the Mega Church, along with all the other charities he donated to in the 2003 to 2006 period, had their charitable registrations revoked by the Minister in years subsequent to 2006. I am unable to see how the Minister\u2019s revocation of charitable status subsequent to the year of the relevant donation claim can be considered information that calls into question whether the Appellant made payments to Mega Church or any of the other charities to which he claimed to have made donations in 2003 to 2006. Even if the Appellant was aware of the matters that the Minister was reviewing in connection with these entities prior to the revocation of their charitable registrations -- and there was no evidence to suggest that the Appellant was so aware -- his knowledge of this information might speak to his motivations for making the donations, but not whether he actually made the payments to those entities in the years claimed. Again, in this appeal, the onus was on the Minister to show that the payments were not made and the fact that the Minister subsequently revoked the charitable status of those entities is not relevant to that point.\n[27] However, even though I do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s submissions on the significance of this other evidence, I find myself resolving the question at hand by returning to inconsistency in the Appellant\u2019s testimony on his pattern of visits to Mega Church in 2006. Earlier, I said that the Appellant\u2019s failure to provide a consistent account of his 2006 Mega Church transaction pattern led me to reject his testimony as proof of the frequency of his 2006 Mega Church payments and the amount each time. But, the impact of the inconsistency in his testimony on this point goes further. Six thousand dollars is a significant amount of money for any individual and it is inconceivable that a person could purport to be transacting with Mega Church and his bank in aggregate amounts of this magnitude and not clearly recall whether it was 3, 24 or 52 visits or that the face amounts of the bank drafts were $2,000, $250 or $115. While I was prepared to accept some imprecision or small inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s recollection of visits to Mega Church in 2006 and delivery of bank drafts on each visit, I find the fact that the Appellant gave starkly inconsistent accounts of his 2006 visits to Mega Church and, by implication, his visits to his bank to purchase bank drafts for delivery to Mega Church supports the conclusion that the aggregate amount of bank drafts that he gave Mega Church could not have been $6,000. It is on this basis I conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant did not purchase and deliver bank drafts payable to Mega Church in 2006 with face amounts of $6,000 in aggregate.\n[28] Accordingly, the Minister is entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s wilful misrepresentation in his 2006 T1 return that he made $6,000 in aggregate donations to Mega Church in 2016.\nIV. FAILURE TO IDENTIFY MR. OKOROAFOR AS PROFESSIONAL TAX PREPARER ON T1 RETURN\n[29] Having decided above that the Minister is entitled to reassess pursuant to paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s misrepresentation concerning the amount of his donation to Mega Church, it is unnecessary for me to consider the Minister\u2019s secondary argument that the Minister would be entitled to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period for 2006 on the basis of the Appellant\u2019s failure to report in box 490 of his 2006 T1 Return the name and address of the tax professional who prepared the return. But, if I were required to consider the question, I would have found that the Minister cannot rely on this type of misrepresentation to justify a reassessment that disallowed charitable donation tax credits.\n[30] On its face, box 490 of the 2006 T1 Return does not identify the defining features of a person who should be considered to be a \u201cprofessional tax preparer\u201d for this purpose. Moreover, Respondent did not put before me any evidence concerning Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s professional credentials and what guidance, if any, the CRA gave for completing box 490 in its published guide for the 2006 T1 return. Consequently, it\u2019s not clear to me that there is a factual basis for concluding that the Appellant made a misrepresentation due to neglect, carelessness or wilful default by failing to ensure that box 490 included Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s name and address.\n[31] However, even if I were to find that the Appellant made a misrepresentation due to neglect, carelessness, or wilful default by not identifying his tax preparer, I have concluded that subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) would apply to prevent the Minister from using paragraph 152(4)(a) to reassess the Appellant beyond the normal reassessment period to deny the charitable donation tax credit in respect a donation to Mega Church.\n[32] The relevant version of subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) provides, as follows:\n(4.01) Assessment to which para. 152(4)(a) or (b) applies \u2013 Notwithstanding subsections [152](4) and (5), an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment to which any of paragraphs 4(a) or 4(b) applies in respect of a taxpayer for a taxation year may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year to the extent that, but only to the extent that, it can reasonably be regarded as relating to,\n(a) where paragraph (4)(a) applies to the assessment, reassessment or additional assessment\n(i) any misrepresentation made by the taxpayer\u2026that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or any fraud committed by the taxpayer\u2026.in filing the return or supplying the information under this Act, \u2026\n[33] Thus, while paragraph 152(4)(a) establishes the circumstances in which the Minister can open a taxpayer\u2019s otherwise statute-barred taxation year, paragraph 152(4.01)(a) places limits on the reassessment power under paragraph 152(4)(a) by requiring that the adjustments in the reassessment be reasonably related to the taxpayer\u2019s misrepresentation. And, in my view, the Minister\u2019s denial of the tax credit in respect of a charitable donation to Mega Church is not an adjustment that can be reasonably regarded as relating to the Appellant\u2019s failure to identify Mr. Okoroafor\u2019s name and address in box 490 of the Appellant\u2019s 2006 T1 Return.\nV. ENTITLEMENT TO THE CHARITABLE DONATION TAX CREDIT\n[34] Having determined that the Minister is entitled to rely on paragraph 152(4)(a) to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period on the basis of a misrepresentation about the charitable donations made in 2006, I move to the question of whether the Appellant is entitled to a charitable donation tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for that amount.\n[35] On this question, the burden is on the Appellant to demonstrate that he met the requirements for claiming the tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) of the ITA for a gift made to Mega Church in 2006.\n[36] I agree with the Respondent that the undated receipt numbered 61833 issued to the Appellant by Mega Church did not comply with the requirements prescribed by subsection 3501(1) of the Income Tax Regulations. More specifically, the receipt did not identify the place that the receipt was issued (as required by paragraph 3501(1)(d)) and, since the Appellant testified that his donation was made by way of bank drafts rather than cash, the receipt also did not identify the dates of the gifts or include a brief description of the property (as required by 3501(1)(e.1)). By virtue of paragraph 118.1(2)(a), a donation receipt for a charitable gift that does not include the information prescribed by the Income Tax Regulations cannot be included in the pool of gifts on which a taxpayer can claim a tax credit under subsection 118.1(3), as confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Kueviakoe, 2021 FCA 64.\n[37] Accordingly, the fact that the Mega Church receipt does not comply with subsection 3501(1) of the Income Tax Regulations is dispositive and precludes the Appellant from receiving a tax credit under subsection 118.1(3) for any 2006 gifts to Mega Church covered by that receipt.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[38] I find that the Minister was entitled to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2006 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period pursuant to paragraph 152(4)(a) of the ITA and, in so reassessing, the Minister was correct to deny the Appellant\u2019s claim for tax credits under subsection 118.1(3) in respect of any 2006 gifts made to Mega Church represented by receipt number 61833.\n[39] The appeal will be dismissed. There will be no award as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 26th day of March 2024.\n\u201cJohn C.

Introduction\n[1] Mr. Nixon\u2019s Appeal (concerning claimed charitable donations) was heard on May 8-11, 2023. A decision was rendered on August 22, 2023 dismissing the appeal. Pursuant to the decision, costs were payable by the Appellant to the Respondent. If the parties were unable to agree upon costs, the Respondent was to file written submissions concerning costs on or before September 29, 2023. The Appellant had until October 31, 2023 to file any responding written submission. The Respondent filed written submissions on September 29, 2023. The Appellant has not filed any responding submissions.\nII. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[2] The Respondents seeks costs of the litigation (up to and including the trial) beyond the Tariff amounts (\u201cenhanced costs\u201d) in a lump sum of $158,652.80. This amounts to 35% of their solicitor-client costs incurred. The Respondent seeks an additional $6,407.63 in disbursements for a total of $165,060.43.\n[3] Concerning preparation for this cost motion, the Respondent seeks $5,000 in additional costs. This amount is sought on the basis that the Respondent attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of an offer to settle but did not receive a response. Given the lack of a response from the Appellant to the settlement offer, as well as the necessity for the Respondent to provide written submissions on the costs motion, I will grant the $5,000 sought for the costs of this motion.\n[4] The Respondent has set out a number of factors which they state supports their claim for $165,060.43 in litigation costs. I will deal with each of these factors below.\nIII. Analysis\n[5] Section 147 of the Rules gives the Court broad discretion in awarding costs. The section provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to consider in exercising its discretionary power to award costs beyond the Tariff amounts.\n[6] Some key principles of costs awards were helpfully summarized by Justice Lafleur in Hillcore Financial Corporation v. The King, TCC 144 (Tax Court of Canada [General Procedure]), and are reproduced here:\n8. The general rule is that costs should be \u201ccompensatory and contributory\u201d and \u201cnot punitive\u201d (see Grenon v. The Queen, 2021 TCC 89, at para 12). Further, an award of costs is generally not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party (see Velcro Canada Inc. v. The Queen, 2012 TCC 273, [ Velcro ], at para 29).\n9. \u2026\n10. The broad discretion of the Court to award costs should not be exercised in an arbitrary manner but must be exercised on a principled basis; further, the quantum of costs must be reasonable and also determined on a principled basis (The Queen v. Lau, 2004 FCA 10, at para 5; The Queen v. Landry, 2010 FCA 135, at paras 22 and 54; Guibord v. Canada, 2011 FCA 346, at para 10 The King v. Bowker, 2023 FCA 133, at para 32).\n11. Subsection 147(3) of the Rules provides a list of factors the Court should consider in exercising its discretion to award costs pursuant to subsection 147(1) of the Rules. However, none of the factors listed in subsection 147(3) of the Rules are determinative and as such, the Court should consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion (Velcro, supra , at paras 12-13). As indicated by this Court in Velcro , the Tariff is \u201c... a reference point only should the Court wish to rely upon it\u201d (at para 8).\n12. The relevant parts of the Rules read as follows:\n147 (1) The Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceeding, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.\n\u2026\n(3) In exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,\n(a) the result of the proceeding,\n(b) the amounts in issue,\n(c) the importance of the issues,\n(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,\n(e) the volume of work,\n(f) the complexity of the issues,\n(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,\n(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,\n(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,\n(i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,\n(i.1) whether the expense required to have an expert witness give evidence was justified given\n(i) the nature of the proceeding, its public significance and any need to clarify the law,\n(ii) the number, complexity or technical nature of the issues in dispute, or\n(iii) the amount in dispute; and\n(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n\u2026\n14. This Court is not limited to applying the Tariff. Subsection 147(4) of the Rules provides that the Court \u201c... may fix all or part of the costs with or without reference to Schedule II, Tariff B and, further, it may award a lump sum in lieu of or in addition to any taxed costs\u201d.\n15. The case law has held that \u201c...increased costs beyond the Tariff are not tied to exceptional circumstances, such as misconduct, malfeasance or undue delay\u201d (see Duffy v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 135 [ Duffy ], at para 21; Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v. The Queen, 2013 TCC 275, at para 4; Ford Motor, supra , at para 7). Indeed, recent case law held that a greater recognition of the work involved in tax litigation should be a factor to consider in awarding costs (see Duffy, supra, at para 21; Blackburn Radio Inc. v. the Queen, 2013 TCC 98, at paras 14-15; Invesco Canada Ltd v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 92, at paras 17 and 25; Spruce Credit Union v. The Queen, 2014 TCC 42, at para 52; Univar Holdco Canada ULC v. The Queen, 2020 TCC 15, at para 33).\n[7] The Respondent has set out a number of factors that they wish the Court to consider in justifying their claim for enhanced costs. I will focus my attention on these submissions rather than walking through numerous factors which are of no weight to my decision.\nA. Paragraph 147(3)(a): The results of the proceeding\n[8] The Crown was entirely successful. This was not an all or nothing appeal. It was conceivable at the outset of trial that either all or some portion of the Appellant\u2019s claimed gift be allowed, such as the cash contributions made pursuant to the Berkshire Program. As set out in their costs submissions, at one point the Respondent had offered to settle the litigation by allowing $60,000 as a charitable gift allowed to be claimed by the Appellant in the 2003 taxation year.\n[9] This factor does support the Respondent\u2019s claim for a partial indemnity costs of $35%.\nB. Paragraph 147(3)(c): The importance of the issues [10] The Respondent argues that the Nixon decision may influence the next steps for other related litigation files that are being held in abeyance. Given the large volume of decisions dealing with charitable donations, I do not find that the issues in this case were novel, complicated, nor added much precedential value. I find this factor neutral.\nC. Paragraph 147(3)(d): Any offer of settlement made in writing\n[11] The Respondent attempted to settle a portion this matter by way of an offer made on February 25, 2015. The offer would have allowed the Appellant to claim as a donation $60,000 for the 2003 taxation year. This offer was revoked on December 11, 2020. It therefore does not meet the requirements of 147(3)(d)[1]. Nevertheless, case law has consistently found, as I have in this instance, that a settlement offer, even if it does not meet the requirements of 147(3)(d) can be taken into account by the trial judge in awarding costs. The parties are expected to make reasonable settlement offers. The Crown has done so. I will therefore consider the offer as a factor supporting the enhanced costs sought by the Crown.\nD. Paragraph 147(e) The volume of work\n[12] The Respondent has provided detailed submissions supporting the fact that preparing for and conducting this appeal involved a great deal of work. Lawyers and paralegals documented 1848 hours both preparing this matter for trial and conducting the trial. This preparation work includes a large amount of time spent working on a particular undertaking sought by the Appellant. This is referenced simply for the fact that it supports the large amount of hours spent on the file by the Respondent. The hearing took a full sitting week and was scheduled to continue into a second week. The exceptionally large amount of work spent on this matter does support an award for enhance costs as sought by the Respondent.\nE. Appellant chose to mislead the Court\n[13] After hearing the evidence, it was my conclusion that the Appellant\u2019s testimony, in particular concerning the $300,000 he claimed to have gifted in both 2002 and 2003, defied logic and was misleading. Yet I do not feel I should consider increasing costs as a punitive step. I will simply consider this factor in considering whether one party did anything that may have prolonged the trial.\n[14] The Appellant\u2019s testimony in Chief required a fairly extensive cross examination, with numerous documents being put to the Appellant. The cross examination was effective in assisting me to reach many of the conclusions I did in this matter. But, it also resulted in a longer trial than was necessary. I do accept that this factor supports the position of the Respondent concerning costs.\n[15] I should be clear that I am not double counting this factor, it simply supports the conclusion that the Respondent, in spending 1848 hours on this matter, is entitled to enhanced costs in part because of the volume of work required. The Appellant\u2019s conduct at trial added to the volume of work necessary.\nF. Paragraph 147(3)(h): The denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted\n[16] The Respondent claims they are entitled to costs above the tariff in part because the Appellant refused to admit facts that should have been admitted. Specifically the Appellant lead the Respondent to believe that they would challenge the facts surrounding the operation of the Berkshire program, only to inform the Court on the first day of trial that the Appellant did not see the need to put in evidence facts concerning the mechanics of the Berkshire program.\n[17] It is my understanding that to walk through the various component parts of the Berkshire program would have taken several days of additional evidence and several additional witnesses.\n[18] The Respondent also served a request to admit on the Appellant that primarily dealt with the operation of the Berkshire program. The Appellant refused to admit the majority of the facts set out on the basis that he had no knowledge.\n[19] I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that the refusal to admit the facts concerning the operation of the underlying Berkshire program, as well as the lack of communication with the Respondent concerning the Appellant\u2019s intention not to put in issue at trial the various components of the Berkshire program, greatly increased the time spent by the Respondent in preparing for trial. This factor does support the enhanced costs sought by the Respondent.\nG. Paragraph 147(1)(j): The Appellant brought an appeal that was unwinnable and without merit\n[20] The only question before the Court was whether the Appellant made gifts as per the meaning of ss.118.1(1) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) in the 2002 and 2003 taxation years. There is a large body of case law from both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeal concerning various legal issues that arise in some of the charitable gift donation programs.\n[21] As set out in paragraph 44 of the Nixon decision, one such issue is that in order to be a valid gift for Income Tax purposes, the donation of a charitable gift requires an impoverishment of the donor[2]. This factor was explored by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Markou decision.\n[22] The evidence in this case indicated that that the Appellant would have an \u201cannual cash flow benefit\u201d as a result of his participation in the Berkshire program (see paragraph 10 of the Nixon decision). Furthermore, the facts of this matter supported the conclusion that the Appellant was to receive, on the same day he made his donation, the $300,000 amount he paid to the charity (See paragraph 38 (v)(vi) and (vii) and paragraph 40 of the Nixon decision for analysis). Based on numerous objective factors that were prevalent in this matter, I do agree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that this was an unwinnable case for the Appellant. This favours an award beyond the Tariff amount.\n[23] In a recent cost judgment Justice Spiro canvassed various costs awards, providing a helpful analysis as to what the court has awarded[3]. I have reproduced the analysis below:\n[22] I have considered the percentage of costs awarded by the Court, including the following:\nEnhanced Costs Award\nCase\n20%\nGeneral Electric Capital Canada Inc. v The Queen, 2010 TCC 490\n20% (and 60%)\nGrenon v The Queen, 2021 TCC 89\n30%\nKlemen v R, 2014 TCC 369\n35%\nCameco Corporation v The Queen, 2019 TCC 92\n35%\nDamis Properties Inc. v The Queen, 2021 TCC 44\n36%\nCIT Group Securities (Canada) Inc. v The Queen, 2017 TCC 86\n39%\nChad v The King, 2023 TCC 76\n40%\nInvesco Canada Ltd. v R, 2015 TCC 92\n45%\nPaletta Estate v The Queen, 2021 TCC 41\n50%\nUnivar Holdco Canada ULC v The Queen, 2020 TCC 15\nIV. Conclusion [24] In light of my consideration of the factors set out in subsection 147(3) of the Rules, and my review of other Tax Court\u2019s costs decisions, 35% of total costs is an appropriate cost award for the Respondent.\n[25] This amounts to a fixed cost award of $158,652.80. The Respondent is also entitled to recover disbursements of $6,407.63.\n[26] As for the costs of this motion, the Respondent states that they attempted to settle the issue of costs by way of offer to the Appellant, yet received no response. The Appellant also has not made any submissions in this matter. I will therefore award costs for this motion at an additional $5,000 as requested by the Respondent.\n[27] The total amount payable from the Appellant to the Respondent is $170,060.43.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 8th day of January 2024.\n\u201cR.

Overview\n[1] This matter involves a motion made by the Respondent to quash the appeal from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] The notice of assessment is dated June 8, 2017 and relates to the Appellant\u2019s 2013 taxation year (the \u201cAssessment\u201d). The Respondent argues that the Appellant has not fulfilled an essential precondition for instituting an appeal as it failed to serve a notice of objection within the time-limits set out in the Act.\n[3] The Respondent therefore argues the appeal \u201cdiscloses no reasonable grounds for appeal\u201d and should be quashed, relying on paragraph 53(1)(d) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).\n[4] The Appellant takes the position that although the Assessment is dated June 8, 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) failed to mail it at that time and a copy was only mailed, at the request of its authorized agent, on June 6, 2022.\n[5] The Appellant therefore argues that the correct date of mailing of the assessment is June 6, 2022 and that it promptly served a notice of objection. As a result, the appeal is properly before this Court and should be heard on its merits.\n[6] For reasons that follow, the Court concludes the appeal should be quashed because the Appellant received or is deemed to have received the Assessment on June 8, 2017. The appeal is therefore out of time.\nII. The Issues\n[7] The issue at the heart of this motion is whether the Appellant received or is deemed to have received the Assessment on June 8, 2017. If the Court concludes in the affirmative, the motion must be allowed and the appeal quashed.\n[8] Alternatively, if the Court concludes that the Assessment was mailed to the Appellant on June 6, 2022 and that a notice of objection was served on June 27, 2022, the motion must be dismissed.\nIII. The Relevant Statutory Provisions\n[9] The following statutory provisions are relevant to this appeal:\n152(8) Assessment deemed valid and binding - An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission in the assessment or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\n[10] Subsections 244(10), (14) and (15) are set out in Part XV of the Act entitled Administration and Enforcement and subtitled Procedure and Evidence :\n244(10) Proof of no appeal - An affidavit of an officer of the Canada Revenue Agency, sworn before a commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, setting out that the officer has charge of the appropriate records and has knowledge of the practice of the Agency and that an examination of those records shows that a notice of assessment for a particular taxation year or a notice of determination was mailed or otherwise communicated to a taxpayer on a particular day under this Act and that, after careful examination and search of those records, the officer has been unable to find that a notice of objection or of appeal from the assessment or determination or a request under subsection 245(6), as the case may be, was received within the time allowed, shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be received as evidence of the statements contained in it.\n(\u2026)\n244(14) Mailing or sending notice - For the purposes of this Act, where any notice or notification described in subsection 149.1(6.3), 152(3.1), 165(3) or 166.1(5) or any notice of assessment or determination is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice or notification.\n(\u2026)\n244(15) Date when assessment made - If any notice of assessment or determination has been sent by the Minister as required by this Act, the assessment or determination is deemed to have been made on the day of sending of the notice of the assessment or determination.\n(\u2026)\n[11] Section 248 is set out in Part XVII of the Act entitled Interpretation and contains a number of definitions including the following:\n248(7) Receipt of things mailed - For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) anything (other than a remittance or payment described in paragraph 248(7)(b)) sent by first class mail or its equivalent shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it was sent on the day it was mailed; and (\u2026)\nIV. The Relevant Facts.\n[12] By way of background, the Appellant was a non-resident of Canada with an office in London, Ontario. On April 17, 2013, it redeemed 30% of its shares held by a Delaware corporation and withheld tax at the rate of 5%.\n[13] On June 8, 2017, the Minister assessed the Appellant for a total of $609,193 (including penalties and interest) on the basis that the appropriate withholding rate was 15%. Further details are set out in the notice of appeal filed herein.\n(1) Evidence of the Respondent\n[14] In support of its motion to quash the appeal, the Respondent submitted three affidavits prepared in accordance with subsection 244(10) of the Act. All of the affiants were called as witnesses at the hearing.\nA - Michele Nguyen [15] Ms. Nguyen was an officer in the Toronto Litigation Office of the CRA. She claimed to have appropriate knowledge of the records and practise of CRA and had examined the specific records pertaining to the Appellant.\n[16] She referred to a database used to store all electronic correspondence sent to taxpayers in a system referred to as \u201cEnterprise Correspondence Outputs \/ Enterprise Correspondence History\u201d or \u201cECH\u201d. It indicated that the Minister had assessed the Appellant, then known as Sodecia Canada Inc., for the 2013 taxation year by notice of assessment dated June 8, 2017.\n[17] A reproduction of the Assessment, titled \u201cNon-resident tax notice of assessment\u201d, was appended to her affidavit. The mailing address was 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario.\n[18] She explained that it was CRA\u2019s practise to store taxpayer information including address history in an electronic mainframe and that her search of those records confirmed that the Appellant\u2019s mailing address commencing in December 19, 2011, was 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario but that it was changed to 425 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario effective June 9, 2020.\n[19] The CRA records indicated that the Appellant had not filed a notice of objection to the Assessment but that it purported to do so on June 27, 2022. By letter dated August 31, 2022, CRA advised that the purported notice of objection could not be accepted as it had not been filed within 90 days from the date of the Assessment.\nB - Grant Hutter\n[20] As set out in his affidavit, Mr. Hutter described himself as a \u201cPrograms Officer in the Non-Resident Source Deductions (NRSD) System Support Section, Debt Management Systems Division, Technology and Business Systems Division, Technology and Business Intelligence Directorate of the Collections and Verifications Branch\u201d of the CRA. By virtue of his duties, he had personal knowledge of the manner in which CRA maintained a daily Enterprise Automated Outputs (EAO) NRSD summary report of a notice of assessment.\n[21] He provided a detailed explanation of the various steps involved in the preparation and printing of the EAO NRSD Summary resulting in the creation of a report with cycle run dates and cycle number that corresponded to the issue date of the notice of assessment.\n[22] In particular, Mr. Hutter explained that the EAO NRSD Summary report was stored electronically in an excel file for future reference and that he had consulted such a report to confirm that the run date was processed on June 6, 2017, being two business days prior to the actual date of the assessment.\n[23] As a result of his enquiries, he was able to determine that the Assessment was released from the EAO NRSD summary as batch cycle 1927 which ran on June 6, 2017, with a notice date of June 8, 2017. He attached a computer printout report highlighting the cycle number and indication that there were no errors in the cycle.\n[24] Mr. Hutter also consulted what he referred to as the \u201cSummerside Daily Report\u201d for the 2013 taxation year printed as part of a file provided to Summerside for cycle 1927. He explained that the job quantity and total job quantities were reconciled against the EAO NRSD Summary for continuity purposes.\nC - Joanne Myers\n[25] Ms. Myers explained that she was acting manager of the \u201cPrint to Mail Division\u201d at the Taxation Centre located in Summerside, PEI, that she had charge of the records mailed from the Print to Mail Divisions and knowledge of the agency\u2019s practises. She had also examined the electronic print records of the Appellant in connection with the assessment for the 2013 taxation year.\n[26] She explained the CRA followed a set of procedures for communicating with taxpayers in writing and that one of these procedures included the use of two \u201cPrint to Mail\u201d sites located in Summerside, PEI and Sudbury, Ontario.\n[27] Ms. Myers explained that all information to be set out in a notice of assessment was formatted electronically via an automated process and the data was released electronically to the Print to Mail Section for printing. She indicated that a notice of assessment was mailed to a taxpayer no later than three business days from the time the Print to Mail Site received the print file.\n[28] The Print to Mail site was responsible for printing notices of assessment, inserting them into envelopes and having them ready for pick-up by Canada Post. Smaller jobs of fewer than 100 notices were inserted manually into envelopes while larger jobs used a high-speed inserter that mechanically folded the notices and inserted them into envelopes.\n[29] She explained that \u201ccontrol reports\u201d were prepared with a \u201cjob ticket\u201d to monitor and balance documents to be printed and to serve as a check and balance to minimize processing. As well, CRA maintained an \u201cElectronic Daily Mailing Report\u201d showing the daily mailing jobs received, printed and mailed.\n[30] Ms. Myers indicated that she had reviewed the \u201cElectronic Daily Mailing Report\u201d and relevant \u201cElectronic Canada Post Statement\u201d of mailing and had concluded that the proper procedures were followed for EAO cycle 1927.\n[31] She concluded by indicating the print file containing the Appellant\u2019s notice of assessment dated June 8, 2017, was received at the Print to Mail site on June 7, 2017, and released to Canada Post for mailing on June 8, 2017.\n(2) Evidence of the Appellant\n[32] As part of its responding materials to the motion, the Appellant submitted two affidavits. Both affiants testified as well as a former employee.\nA - Shirley Quick\n[33] Ms. Quick worked as a human resources assistant for a related company known as Sodecia Automotive London Inc. (\u201cSodecia\u201d).\n[34] The Appellant and Sodecia shared a leased office space in an industrial building located at 300 Sovereign Road, London, Ontario until August 2017.\n[35] In July 2017, the offices and management offices were moved on a temporary basis to 2530 Innovation Drive until October 2017 and then to 425 Sovereign Drive, London, Ontario, on a permanent basis.\n[36] Ms. Quick indicated that she helped with the packing and sorting of files from 300 Sovereign Drive to 2530 Innovation Drive and then to 425 Sovereign Drive. To the best of her recollection, no financial or tax-related information was purged from the files as they were moved. All such documents were stored in banker\u2019s boxes or moved in locked filing cabinets.\n[37] She also handled all incoming mail at 300 Sovereign Road. The mail carrier would enter the lobby through the front door of the building and knock on a window looking into the office. If she was present, the mail would be given to her. If no one answered, the mail would be left on the sill in the lobby just outside the office.\n[38] It was her practise to remit any incoming CRA correspondence to Wilma Luesink, Sodecia\u2019s controller. Ms. Luesink ceased working for Sodecia on October 6, 2017 and did not move to the permanent location at 425 Sovereign Drive.\n[39] Ms. Quick explained that there was a double filing cabinet with four drawers, part of which was used by Ms. Leusink. The top drawer was used to keep corporate records and the second drawer for tax records.\n[40] Ms. Quick indicated that in 2023 she searched this filing cabinet by removing all files. She was able to locate a file with tax documents that she provided to Jose Antunes, the accounting and tax manager for Sodecia and the Appellant.\n[41] She concluded that she had no recollection of a tax assessment addressed to the Appellant in June 2017 and was unable to find one when she completed her search of Sodecia\u2019s files in 2023.\nB - Wilma Luesink [42] Ms. Luesink worked for Sodecia from 1999 to October 2017. During the relevant period, she worked as \u201csenior accountant\u201d and was responsible for all financial matters including payment of invoices, month-end reporting, financial statements as well as health and dental benefits and payroll for over 100 employees. She had no formal training and had initially worked in \u201caccounts payable.\u201d\n[43] All incoming mail involving GST\/HST or taxes was given to her. CRA correspondence would be opened and put away in the filing cabinet or sent to the finance manager or a scanned copy would be sent to the US office. She would not deal directly with tax matters.\n[44] The management offices were located off the main lobby and the production facilities were located at the rear of the building. She confirmed Ms. Quick\u2019s testimony as to how mail was delivered by the mail carrier, adding that there was no receptionist during the relevant period. In particular, she confirmed that mail could be left on the sill located in the lobby, just outside the office.\n[45] She also corroborated the testimony of Ms. Quick, indicating that she had the use of a filing cabinet located outside her office in a space with the workstations and cubicles for other employees. She had use of the two top drawers of that filing cabinet and CRA mail was filed in the second drawer.\n[46] Ms. Luesink was aware of the dispute involving an assessment relating to the Appellant\u2019s 2013 taxation year but she could not specifically recall seeing the Assessment. She could only provide her recollection as to how they dealt with any incoming mail including CRA correspondence.\n[47] She confirmed that her team was relocated to 2530 Innovation Drive in August 2017 and the filing cabinet with the various records, including any CRA correspondence, was moved to this temporary location and placed by her desk.\n[48] She had no knowledge of how records were dealt with after her departure.\nC - Jose Antunes [49] Mr. Antunes assumed the role of accounting and tax manager of Sodecia and the Appellant in May 2020 but his office was located in the State of Michigan, USA. He confirmed that the Appellant was unable to locate the Assessment and that CRA had mailed it to them in June 2022.\n[50] Although he was aware of the various office moves, he had no personal knowledge of the practice for handling mail at 300 Sovereign Road.\n[51] He expressed the view that the Assessment was material and that either Ms. Quick or Ms. Luesink, the controller at the time, would have recognized its significance had it been mailed to 300 Sovereign Road in June 2017.\n[52] Mr. Antunes noted that the Assessment was addressed to the Appellant at 300 Sovereign Road but that the CRA letter refusing to accept the purported notice of objection of June 2022 was addressed to 425 Sovereign.\n[53] His affidavit included Articles of Amendment dated April 17, 2017 whereby \u201cSodecia Canada Inc.\u201d changed its name to \u201cSodecia Canada Investments Inc.\u201d\nV. Analysis and Discussion\n[54] As noted in Canada (National Revenue) v. ConocoPhilips Canada Resource Corp., 2014 FCA 297 (\u201cConocoPhilips\u201d), the outcome of this motion is of singular importance to the Appellant because an assessment is deemed to be valid and binding unless varied or vacated on appeal, as set out in subsection 158(2).\n[55] Service of a valid notice of objection \u201cis a condition precedent to the institution of an appeal.\u201d If there is no evidence of a valid notice of objection, the appeal should be quashed as the Court has no jurisdiction \u201cto further extend the time for equitable reasons\u201d: Bormann v. Canada, 2006 FCA 83 (paras. 3-6).\n[56] Where a taxpayer alleges that a notice of assessment was not received, the Court must consider the \u201cfull evidentiary record with regard to the statutory presumption found in subsection 244(14) of the Act (which presumes a notice of reassessment to have been mailed on its date)\u201d (ConocoPhilips, para. 8).\n[57] In this instance, both parties agree that an appropriate analytical framework, involving a four-step test, was described by Justice Graham in Mpamugo v. HMTQ, 2016 TCC 215 (\u201cMpamugo\u201d) (para. 6) (aff\u2019d 2017 FCA 136).\n[58] The first step involves an assertion by the taxpayer that the notice of assessment was not mailed at all or was not mailed to the correct address.\n[59] The second step requires that the Minister prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the notice of assessment was mailed. If the Minister is able to do so, the mailing is presumed to have occurred on the date set out in the assessment.\n[60] Use of the word \u201cpresumed\u201d in subsection 244(14), gives rise to a rebuttable presumption. As part of the third step, the taxpayer may introduce evidence to prove that the assessment was actually mailed on a different date or to the wrong address. Justice Graham went on to explain the fourth step as follows:\nStep 4: Once the mailing date is established (either through the presumption or through proof of a different date), the assessment is deemed to have been made on that date (subsection 244(15)) and the Notice of Assessment is deemed to have been received on that date (subsection 248(7)). These deeming provisions are not rebuttable. (\u2026)\n[61] In order to prove mailing, the Minister may rely on an affidavit prepared pursuant to subsection 244(10) where a CRA officer attests to being in charge of the appropriate records and having knowledge of the practises of CRA and indicates that he or she has examined the records for a particular taxpayer and that those records show that a notice of assessment has been sent. Absent any proof to the contrary, such an affidavit may suffice to prove mailing: (Mpamugo, para. 12).\n[62] If the Minister is unable to rely on such an affidavit, it needs to adduce evidence \u201cto show that it is more likely than not that the Notice was mailed\u201d and \u201cso long as the Crown can introduce some evidence that the mailing occurred, with no credible evidence to counter the Crown\u2019s evidence, the conclusion should be that the Crown has proven mailing\u201d (Mpamugo, para. 13).\n[63] In Barrington Lane Developments Limited v. The Queen, 2010 TCC 388, the taxpayer had argued that the evidence of mailing was insufficient. Justice Pizzitelli reviewed the evidence of two CRA employees who outlined the mailing process including the electronic downloading of the information for the assessment, the transfer of that information to a printing and mailing site in Canada with a log containing the date of shipping, a tracking number, the name of the taxpayer and a cycle number referencing the batch of notices sent on that day.\n[64] In the end, Justice Pizzitelli was satisfied with the evidence, concluding that \u201cthe detailed and documented processes dealing with the electronic downloading, printing and mailing of the notices of assessment\/reassessment constitute, on a balance of probabilities, prima facie proof that they are mailed\u201d (para. 11.)\n[65] In this instance, the Crown submitted the affidavit of Ms. Nguyen made pursuant to subsection 244(10). She also testified and confirmed that she had accessed the CRA records containing all correspondence to or from the Appellant including the Assessment. From her analysis of those records, she was able to confirm that the Assessment was mailed on June 8, 2017 and that a timely notice of objection had not been filed.\n[66] The computer printouts appended to Ms. Nguyen\u2019s affidavit, indicate that outgoing CRA mail addressed to the Appellant at 300 Sovereign Road was being returned. The address was updated to 425 Sovereign Road effective June 9, 2020 but this appears to have been done internally by cross checking records. There was no suggestion the Appellant had provided a notice of change of address prior to that time, despite the evidence it moved to 425 Sovereign Road in October 2017.\n[67] This change of address would have explained why the Assessment was sent to the Appellant at the 300 Sovereign Road but the \u201crefusal\u201d letter, described in the affidavit of Mr. Antunes, was addressed to 425 Sovereign Road.\n[68] Moreover, the Court notes that the Assessment was addressed to \u201cSodecia Canada Inc.\u201d but the cover letter containing the purported notice of objection of June 27, 2022, informed CRA that the Appellant\u2019s had changed its name to \u201cSodecia Canada Investments Inc.\u201d effective April 7, 2017. This matter was not addressed and no explanation was provided to explain a gap of over five years.\n[69] Mr. Hutter provided a detailed explanation of the preparation of non-resident notices of assessment, the process for downloading that information to an excel file to be sent to a mailing centre with the cycle run date and cycle number that corresponded to the issue date of the Assessment. He was also able to cross-check that information with the records from the mailing centre.\n[70] Similarly, Ms. Myers provided a detailed explanation of the receipt of the information that was released electronically to the Print to Mail section in Summerside, PEI where she worked. She also cross-checked that information with the daily mailing report and electronic Canada Post statement.\n[71] There is no need to repeat their testimony in further detail and I do not propose to do so. The Court finds the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses was both credible and convincing and unshaken by cross-examination.\n[72] As a result, the Court concludes that it is more likely than not that the Assessment was sent and that the Minister has established, on a balance of probabilities, that it was mailed to the Appellant on June 8, 2017.\n[73] I now turn to the evidence adduced by the Appellant.\n[74] The Court agrees with the Respondent that there are gaps in the Appellant\u2019s evidence. The first concern is that mail delivered to 300 Sovereign Road could be left unattended in the lobby that was accessible to anyone who entered the building.\n[75] Secondly, Ms. Quick indicated she had no recollection of the Assessment but this is not surprising since all CRA correspondence was given to Ms. Luesink. There was no suggestion that Ms. Quick would actually open the envelopes.\n[76] Similar concerns arise with Ms. Leusink\u2019s evidence. If the CRA correspondence contained an assessment, this was not an \u201caction item\u201d or another invoice to be paid as part of her daily routine. Since she was not directly involved in taxes, she was only expected to do determine to whom it should be given. Her evidence was that she would provide the envelope to the finance manager or send a scanned copy to the US office. It was not clear how that decision was made but the Court may reasonably infer that the finance manager, as Ms. Luesink\u2019s superior, would have decided what was to be done.\n[77] None of the witnesses provided any information about the finance manager or where that person\u2019s office was located. The Court may reasonably infer that it was located in the same building as part of the \u201cmanagement offices\u201d. If so, the envelope containing the Assessment would likely have been remitted directly to that person and there was no need for Ms. Luesink to include a copy in her tax file.\n[78] The fact that Ms. Quick had searched the filing cabinet in 2023 and determined that the Assessment was not in the tax file does not seem surprising because it did not have any direct bearing on Ms. Leusink\u2019s duties.\n[79] To provide further context, Ms. Quick and Ms. Luesink worked for the operating company known as Sodecia Automotive London Inc. and not directly or only indirectly for the Appellant. Even if they had received the Assessment in June 2017, the Court may reasonably infer that it was not of much concern to them because it was addressed to the Appellant and not their direct employer.\n[80] Moreover, both Sodecia and the Appellant were in the midst of a relocation from 300 Sovereign Road to a temporary location in July 2017. This raises the possibility that the envelope containing the Assessment was simply put aside to be dealt with at a point in time and possibly misplaced or forgotten.\n[81] In the end, the evidence is inconclusive. The Court finds that the Appellant has not rebutted the presumption that the Assessment was mailed on June 8, 2017.\nVI. Conclusion\n[82] Since the Court has concluded that the Assessment \u201chas been sent by the Minister\u201d, a proper reading of subsection 244(15) is that \u201cthe assessment (\u2026) is deemed to have been made on the day of sending the notice of assessment\u201d, being June 8, 2017. A similar conclusion arises from subsection 248(7).\n[83] For all the foregoing reasons, the Court orders and adjudges that the appeal be quashed with costs to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 27th day of March 2024.\n\u201cGuy Smith\u201d\nSmith J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 40\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-3160(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSODECIA CANADA INVESTMENTS INC. v.

BRERETON,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\n[1] This is an appeal by the Appellant of assessments for his 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax returns. The Canada Revenue Agency has assessed the Appellant\u2019s unreported income of $33,646 for 2006, $34,840 for 2007, $27,343 for 2008 and $27,452 for 2009. The Appellant filed a Notice of Objection on November 10th, 2011 and the Minister confirmed the assessments on March 25th, 2013.\n[2] In his Notice of Appeal filed on June 24th, 2013, the Appellant took the following position:\na)that, at all relevant times, he was a foster parent;\nb)he was an individual and not a trust;\nc)in caring for the children, he received from the province of British Columbia social assistance payments on the basis of a means, needs or income test;\nd)the payments were received indirectly by him for the benefit of the children in the care of the province of British Columbia;\ne)he was not related to the children;\nf)he received no family allowance or similar payment on behalf of the children;\ng)he maintained a separate principal residence for his own personal use, but his principal residence was the home where the children resided;\nh)the payments were made to him by the province for the direct benefit of the children;\ni)the province of British Columbia had represented to him and others like him that the payments were exempt from tax so that he held a reasonable belief that that was the case;\nj)on the basis of the foregoing, he concluded that he was not required to keep books or records of his expenditures for and on behalf of the children.\n[3] At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant argued that he could rely on subsection 81(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act which exempts tax on certain payments made to foster parents, but that, if he could not, he was relying on the doctrine of estoppel because of the representations made to him by the province of British Columbia.\n[4] An important issue here is that the Appellant did not attempt to rebut any of the assumptions made by the Minister as he did not wish to testify despite my strong suggestion that he do so, and he filed no documentary evidence to support his appeal.\n[5] He called his brother David Brereton as a witness. He was a foster parent for a number of years starting in 2002, being paid a monthly amount by the province of British Columbia to have at-risk children live in his residence, and he was responsible for them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He was a foster parent in the true sense of the term. This is a much different situation in which the Appellant found himself, so his brother\u2019s evidence is simply not helpful to his case.\n[6] With respect to the Appellant, I must rely on the assumptions of fact made by the Minister in making findings of fact as the Appellant did not attempt to rebut them in any way, shape or form.\n[7] During the relevant period of time, the Appellant was providing caregiving services to at-risk children, but as a subcontractor in one or more homes rented by Mr. John Cole. Mr. Cole had contracted with the province of British Columbia to provide housing and care for at-risk children who could not be placed in traditional foster care. Mr. Cole never lived in any of those homes; he was essentially running a business and running these homes for profit. In that capacity, Mr. Cole used a pool of seven or eight subcontractors, of which the Appellant was one, to provide caregiver services to the at-risk children. The subcontractors worked a maximum of two 12-hour shifts per week for which they were paid $250 to $300. Mr. Cole paid for the subcontractors\u2019 food and other miscellaneous expenses while on duty, and he provided resting quarters for the staff. Importantly, the Appellant never resided in any of the homes, nor did any of the at risk children ever reside in his residence which, during the relevant period of time, was 2557 Forbes St., Victoria, British Columbia.\n[8] The payments made by Mr. Cole to the Appellant were not social assistance payments made on the basis of a means, needs or income test, nor did the Appellant receive any social assistance payments for the care of the children directly from the ministry. In his capacity as a caregiver, the Appellant did not incur any expenses relating to his work as a subcontractor.\n[9] The relevant section from the Income Tax Act is subsection 81(1)(h) which provides as follows:\n(h) where the taxpayer is an individual (other than a trust), a social assistance payment (other than a prescribed payment) ordinarily made on the basis of a means, needs or income test under a program provided for by an Act of Parliament, a law of a province or a law of an Indigenous governing body (as defined in section 2 of the Children\u2019s Special Allowances Act), to the extent that it is received directly or indirectly by the taxpayer for the benefit of another individual (other than the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a person who is related to the taxpayer or to the taxpayer\u2019s spouse or common-law partner), if\n(i) no family allowance under the Family Allowances Act or any similar allowance under a law of a province that provides for payment of an allowance similar to the family allowance provided under that Act is payable in respect of the other individual for the period in respect of which the social assistance payment is made, and\n(ii) the other individual resides in the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of residence, or the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of residence is maintained for use as the residence of that other individual, throughout the period referred to in subparagraph 81(1)(h)(i);\n[10] For subsection 81(1)(h) to apply to the case at bar, I would have to find the following:\na)that the payments made to the Appellant were social assistance payments made to him, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the at-risk children based on a means, needs and income test;\nb)that the at-risk youth were not related to him;\nc)that no other family allowance under any other programme was paid for the benefit of the at-risk children; and\nd) the children resided in the Appellant\u2019s principal residence.\n[11] Clearly, the Appellant fails on the first and fourth prongs of the test. There is absolutely no evidence that payments were made based on a means, needs and income test. In fact, the Appellant was being paid a daily rate to work for Mr. Cole. The evidence is also uncontradicted that none of the children resided in his principal residence. While the Appellant submits in his Notice of Appeal that he had two principal residences, there is no evidence of that.\n[12] The Appellant relies on the doctrine of estoppel suggesting that the Minister should be estopped from declaring this income to be subject to tax as it had been represented to him by someone representing the province of British Columbia that this income would be exempt from tax. In his Notice of Appeal, he indicates that he did not keep books or a record of expenses incurred for the children, given the representation made to him by the province. His position is that the Crown is the Crown, whether federal or provincial, so that the doctrine of estoppel applies even though the representation was made by another level of government.\n[13] First of all, there is absolutely no evidence, oral or documentary, that the Appellant incurred any expenses while being employed as a subcontractor for Mr. Cole.\n[14] Secondly, the doctrine of estoppel simply has no application in this context. In Gallant v The Queen, 2012 TCC 119, Justice Woods had this to say on the issue of estoppel, starting at paragraph 14:\n[14] In this case, the representative of the appellant suggests that the equitable grounds of estoppel should be applied on the basis that there has been a misrepresentation of fact.\n[15] It is clear that estoppel cannot bind the Crown in respect of the law: Goldstein v The Queen, 96 DTC 1029 (TCC). However, principles of estoppel can be applied in respect of misrepresentations of fact: Rogers v The Queen, 98 DTC 1365 (TCC).\n[16] The argument in support of the application of estoppel in this case is that the CRA wrongly represented to the appellant that it would administer section 118.61 in accordance with the form. As far as I am aware, the form has never been changed.\n[17] The difficulty that I have with giving relief is the overriding principle that estoppel cannot be invoked to preclude the exercise of a statutory duty. The principle was described by Chevalier D.J. in Ludmer v The Queen, 1994 CanLII 19486 (FCA), 95 DTC 5311 (FCA), at p. 5314:\nIn Canada v. Lidder, 1992 CanLII 14712 (FCA), [1992] 2 F.C. 621, Marceau, J.A. wrote (at 625):\nThe doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked to preclude the exercise of a statutory duty -- here, the duty of the officer to deal with the application as it was presented -- or to confer a statutorily defined status on a person who clearly does not fall within the statutory definition. Indeed, common sense would dictate that one cannot fail to apply the law due to the misstatement, the negligence or the simple misrepresentation of a government worker.\nIt was suggested in the course of the argument that, if the doctrine of estoppel could not apply, maybe the related doctrine of 'reasonable or legitimate expectation' could. The suggestion was to no avail because this doctrine suffers from the same limitation that restricts the doctrine of estoppel. A public authority may be bound by its undertakings as to the procedure it will follow, but in no case can it place itself in conflict with its duty and forego the requirements of the law. As was repeated by Sopinka, J. recently in writing the judgment of the Supreme Court in Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), 2 S.C.R. 525, at pages 557-558:\nThere is no support in Canadian or English cases for the position that the doctrine of legitimate expectations can create substantive rights. It is a part of the rules of procedural fairness which can govern administrative bodies. Where it is applicable, it can create a right to make representations or to be consulted. It does not fetter the decision following the representations or consultation.\n[15] In light of the above, it is obvious that the Minister cannot be compelled to declare that income that is clearly not exempt from tax be so exempt based on a misrepresentation made by someone from another level of government. In fact, the same reasoning would apply if the misrepresentation had been made by someone from the federal government. As Justice Sopinka indicates in Reference Re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, the doctrine of legitimate expectations cannot create substantive rights. The Appellant may have had expectations that the income earned would be exempt from tax, but that is of no moment. The issue is whether the Appellant meets the test in subsection 81(1)(h), and I have already held that he does not.\n[16] The appeal with respect to assessments made under the Income Tax Act for the Appellant\u2019s 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 taxation years is therefore dismissed.\n[17] No costs shall be awarded.\nSigned at Timmins, Ontario, this 9th day of April 2024.\n\u201cMartin Lambert\u201d\nLambert D.J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 41\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2013-2415(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nJONATHAN A.

PERSAUD,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nBocock J.\nI. Facts in Brief\n[1] The Appellant, Michael Persaud, brings this appeal to claim a medical expense deduction on his 2019 tax return concerning health care costs paid for his then acutely ill father, Dennis Persaud.\n[2] There are not facts in dispute. Dennis Persaud, a Guyanese citizen and resident, was on a visitor\u2019s visa to Canada and planned to stay 2 weeks or so, from May 5 to approximately May 19, 2019. Instead, Dennis suffered a major heart attack and remained in hospital, in Canada, for some 8 weeks until July 14, 2019. During his convalescence in Canada, Dennis required acute and then rehabilitative medical care. He was not covered for such costs because he was not a resident of Canada under applicable Canadian health legislation. Regrettably, Dennis passed away in November, 2021.\n[3] Lest anyone think healthcare is \u201cfree\u201d in Canada, Dennis\u2019 healthcare costs surpassed $18,700. As a dutiful and caring son, Michael Persaud paid those costs for his father, Dennis. Michael claimed the costs as an \u201callowable amount of medical expenses for other dependents\u201d (the \u201cmedical expense deduction\u201d). The Minister denied the request, Michael Persaud objected, and the Minister confirmed her denial.\nII. Statutory Provision\n[4] Several provisions of the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d) speak to the medical expense deductions: section 118.2 as to the nature of medical expenses and subsection 118(b) as to the definition of a dependent in respect of whom a taxpayer may claim the medical expense deduction. The nature of the medical expenses otherwise qualify and the Minister does not contest that issue.\n[5] Specific excerpts from the ITA relevant to this appeal are as follows:\nDefinition of dependant\n(6) For the purposes of paragraph (d) [ \u2026], dependant, of an individual for a taxation year, means a person who at any time in the year is dependent on the individual for support and is\n[... ]\n(b) the parent, [\u2026 ], if resident in Canada at any time in the year, of the individual or of the individual\u2019s spouse or common-law partner.\n[6] A taxpayer must satisfy three components in order to successfully claim the medical expense deduction in relation to a third party. One, the recipient of the treatments must be: related in some way (\u201ckinship\u201d); be dependent on the taxpayer for support (\u201cdependency\u201d); and, if not a spouse or common-law partner or descendant, then fall within a degree of other kinship and be a \u201cresident in Canada at any time in the year\u201d (\u201cresidency\u201d).\nPreliminary Findings and Submissions\nKinship\n[7] On the issue of kinship, Dennis was Michael Persaud\u2019s father. This first component is factually and legally satisfied.\nDependency\n[8] Concerning dependency, the Court found that during his presence in Canada, and distinct from the residency component, Dennis was factually entirely dependent upon Michael Persaud. The amounts paid to support Dennis\u2019 treatment, accommodation and rehabilitation in order to allow him to leave the hospital, and Canada, were for Michael Persaud\u2019s sole account. There is no case authority on point concerning this slightly staggered wording of \u201ca person who at any time in the year is dependent on the individual for support\u201d compared to the residency wording of \u201cif resident in Canada at any time in the year\u201d. The component of dependency has been met. The only contentious issue is the residency component.\nIII. The Parties\u2019 Positions\nResidency\n[9] At the hearing, the parties presented little authority on the issue of the wording of residency used in 118(6)(b) namely, \u201cresidence in Canada at any time in the year\u201d, particularly with respect to the use of the phrase elsewhere in the ITA and authorities which may have considered same. Therefore, the Court allowed some additional time for brief, subsequent submissions. These were received and the Court now renders its decision.\n[10] Michael Persaud interprets paragraph 118(6)(b) to mean \u201ca person that is legally residing in Canada any time between January 1 to December 31 in a specific year\u201d. Since Dennis was issued a legal visa for up to six months, and he visited for some 8 weeks, this constitutes residence in Canada. As such, Dennis was a resident of Canada at the time of his 8 week stay, during which time the expenses were incurred.\n[11] In contrast, the Respondent argues that the foundational subsection 2(1) of the ITA, which directs tax to \u201cbe paid on taxable income... of every person resident in Canada at any time in the year\u201d uses, save for deemed residents, the common law definition of residency. This test embodies the concept of \u201cordinarily resident in Canada\u201d.\nIV. Analysis\n[12] Concerning the residency component, the Court shall determine in the context of medical expense deductions \u201cif\u201d Dennis was a \u201cresident in Canada at any time in the year\u201d.\nThe general rule of interpreting repeated words\n[13] In an Act of Parliament, repeated words, if possible, are to be attributed a consistent meaning throughout an Act. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that \u201cUnless the contrary is clearly indicated by the context, a word should be given the same interpretation or meaning whenever it appears in an act.\u201d[1] Presumptively, a legislature employs language carefully and consistently such that the same words receive the same meaning and different words have different meanings.[2]\n[14] Ascribing similar meaning is particularly true when the words are close together or otherwise related.[3] In Thomson v Canada (Deputy Minister of Agriculture), the Supreme Court of Canada said the following regarding repeated use of the word \u201crecommendation\u201d and its non-binding nature.[4] Justice Cory, for the majority stated:\nThe word is used in other provisions of the Act. Unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the context, a word should be given the same interpretation or meaning whenever it appears in an act. [\u2026]\n[\u2026] Clearly in s. 52(1) \"recommendations\" has its ordinary and plain meaning of advising or counselling. Parliament could not have intended the word \"recommendations\" in the subsequent subsection of the same section to receive a different interpretation. The word must have the same meaning in both subsections.\n[15] Further, the logic was that elsewhere in the legislation the word or expression had a single clear meaning. This finding invoked the presumption of consistent expression warranting application of that meaning throughout. Further, the presumption forcibly applies where the relevant provisions are close together or otherwise related. This tool has been applied repeatedly.\n[16] On the other hand, the presumption may be dislodged where circumstances demonstrate such was not the intention pursued by Parliament\u201d.[5] As Atkin, L.J. said in Martin v Lowry (Inspector of Taxes)[6]:\nIf one could adopt as a rigid canon of construction an assumption that in any statute the same word is always used with the same meaning, one\u2019s task would perhaps be easier; but it is plain that the assumption is ill-founded\u2026 We must have regard to the context.\nThe meaning of \u201cat any time\u201d in Subsection 118(6) of the Act\n[17] The explanatory notes published when 118(6) was introduced do not mention Parliament\u2019s intention behind using the language of \u201cat any time in the year\u201d.[7]\n[18] The history of subsection 118(6) proves more helpful concerning the intention behind the word \u201cat any time in the year\u201d. Before subsection 118(6) was introduced in 1988, there existed the personal exemption under section 109 of the ITA. The 1982 technical notes to subsection 118(6) state:[8]\nSection 109 provides the personal exemptions that are deductible in computing an individual's taxable income. The deduction under paragraph 109(1)(b) [now 118(1)B(b)\u2014ed.] is commonly referred to as the married equivalent deduction for taxpayers who are unmarried, separated or divorced and support a dependant in their ordinary place of residence. The deduction under paragraph 109(1)(f) is for dependent parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters. The amendments to paragraphs 109(1)(b) and (f) [now 118(6)\u2014ed.] require that, to qualify for deduction in a year, a dependant (other than the taxpayer's spouse, children or grandchildren) must have been resident in Canada at some time during the year.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[19] One may conclude there has always existed a necessity to have been \u201cresident\u201d, whether \u201cat any time in the year\u201d or through the lens of the technical notes, \u201cat some time during the year\u201d.\n[20] A claim for deductions where residency was in issue was before this Court in EA Baltazar v Canada[9]. In that case, the appellant claimed various non-refundable tax credits over the period of four years for a dependant that lived overseas.[10] The Appellant argued that the ITA created an exception to the requirement that a dependant be a resident of Canada for the purpose of claiming the equivalent-to-married credit. Justice Sarchuk rejected this argument. He referred to Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s analysis in Ruzicka v Canada.[11] In turn, Justice O\u2019Connor held that any exceptions to a dependant being a resident of Canada, at common law, are by virtue of the deemed resident over-ride where the taxpayer also coincidentally lives overseas and supports someone at home.[12] The dependant must still therefore be a resident of Canada, as the meaning of resident is normally understood at common law.[13]\n[21] In conclusion, in applying the principles found in Thomson, the Court: (i) employs the term or expression as it appears elsewhere in the Act; (ii) analyzes the interpretation given to the term to understand its meaning in context; and, (iii) then applies the presumption of consistent expression. The term \u201cat any time in the year\u201d has otherwise received little judicial interpretation beyond the authorities above.\n[22] Quantitatively, the term \u201cresident in Canada at any time in the year\u201d is found 17 times in the Act. Importantly, it is found in the charging provision: section 2(1) of the Act.\n[23] By use of \u201cat any time in the year\u201d, Parliament modifies \u201cresident\u201d, such that one must be \u201cresident in Canada\u201d for the purposes of satisfying the criteria of being a \u201cdependant\u201d eligible in the context of a claim for the medical expense deduction. Therefore, to be \u201cresident in Canada\u201d, the normal rules of residency should be used which are otherwise applicable to other sections of the ITA to yield consistent application.\n[24] One can be a resident of Canada under two circumstances. One is either a deemed resident[14] or a factual resident[15]. There is no dispute that Dennis was not a deemed resident as he did not spend 183 days or more in Canada.\n[25] Regrettably, Dennis was not a factual resident of Canada at any time in 2019. The purpose of Dennis\u2019 trip was to visit Michael Persaud and other family members for a finite amount of time and well less than 180 days. But for his heart attack, Dennis would have returned home (and his place of residence) in a fortnight. Similarly, there is no evidence otherwise establishing that Dennis was planning to stay in Canada. Dennis never converted or ever intended to convert his intentions, habits or domicile to Canada beyond a short visit, unavoidably delayed for an additional six weeks because of his heart attack. He was not a factual resident.\nV. Conclusion\n[26] Repeated words in a section should be given a consistent interpretation. The law from Thomson states that one takes the term or expression as it appears elsewhere in the Act, analyzes the interpretation given to the term to understand its meaning in context, and then applies the presumption of consistent expression if no contrary intention. That analysis leads to the conclusion Dennis was not an ordinary resident of Canada. The residency component needed to claim medical expense deductions is not present. Regrettably, the appeal is dismissed. There shall be no costs.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 18th day of April 2024.\n\u201cR.S.

It is quite impossible to give it a precise and inclusive definition. It is highly flexible, and its many shades of meaning vary not only in the contexts of different matters, but also in different aspects of the same matter. In one case it is satisfied by certain elements, in another by others, some common, some new.\nAnd at page 816:\nBut in the different situations of so-called \"permanent residence\", \"temporary residence\", \"ordinary residence\", \"principal residence\" and the like, the adjectives do not affect the fact that there is in all cases residence; and that quality is chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living, with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question. It may be limited in time from the outset, or it may be indefinite, or so far as it is thought of, unlimited.\n",

Introduction [1] Tim Fuhr appeals from reassessments made under the Income Tax Act (ITA) for his 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years. With respect to 1499546 Alberta Ltd. (1499), the appeals are from reassessments for its taxation years ending September 30, 2012, and 2013 (the 2012 and 2013 taxation years). The appeals were heard together on common evidence. At times, I will refer to Tim Fuhr and 1499 collectively as the Appellants.\n[2] Mr. Fuhr has been involved in the hospitality industry throughout his working life, first as a dishwasher and then working his way up to management roles and eventually, ownership in restaurants. Over the years, he was a direct or indirect owner of several restaurants, including Rempel\u2019s Pub, Chef Caf\u00e9, Urban Lounge, Fargo\u2019s, The One on Whyte and Fat Boyz (some of these names were transcribed phonetically).\n[3] During the relevant taxation years, 1499 owned and operated Overtime Broiler and Taproom (Overtime). UL Investments Inc. (UL) was a shareholder of 1499. Tim Fuhr was the sole shareholder and director of UL. He was also the sole director of 1499 and the manager of Overtime.\n[4] Using net worth and bank deposit analyses, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) reassessed Tim Fuhr to include unreported income for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years as well as to include shareholder benefits for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years. In addition, the Minister assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA.\n[5] The Minister reassessed 1499 to include unreported income and to disallow expenses for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years. The Minister also assessed penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA.\n[6] It is undisputed that the reassessments were all made beyond the normal reassessment period for each Appellant.\nII. Issues [7] The issues to be determined are as follows:\ni) Was the Minister justified in reassessing the Appellants beyond the normal reassessment period for all the taxation years under appeal?\nii) Was the Minister justified in reassessing Tim Fuhr to include unreported income of $211,522, $194,852 and $514,785 for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively as well as shareholder benefits of $264,600 and $14,700 and other benefits of $10,014 and $7,600 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively?\niii) Was the Minister justified in reassessing 1499 to include unreported income of $316,696 and $395,502 and to disallow expenses in the amount of $141,119 and $99,865 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively? and\niv) Was the Minister justified in imposing penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) on both Appellants for all the taxation years under appeal?\nIII. Facts and Evidence [8] At the outset, it bears mentioning that the evidence about the alleged unreported income, disallowed expenses, share ownership of various corporations as well as some of the submissions surrounding the net worth analysis were, to say the least, unclear and confusing.\n[9] Counsel for the Appellants called two witnesses, Tim Fuhr and Wayne Herbert, a chartered professional accountant.\n[10] Mr. Herbert was the external accountant for 1499 and UL. He prepared their corporate income tax returns as well as the personal income tax returns for Tim Fuhr and members of his family. Mr. Herbert testified in a forthright and forthcoming manner. He answered questions directly, and in cross-examination, he did not hesitate to indicate the limits of his involvement in reviewing the information that was provided by 1499\u2019s bookkeeper.\n[11] Tim Fuhr\u2019s testimony was not consistently or completely forthcoming. He did not testify in a straightforward and forthright manner. His answer to many important questions about several cheques and bank drafts of significant amounts paid to his order was that he did not remember. This seriously damaged his credibility. I will address specific examples in the reasons below.\n[12] The Respondent did not call any witnesses. Counsel for the Respondent stated that she had been unable to secure the attendance of their witness. She stated that the Respondent would rely entirely on cross-examination of the Appellants\u2019 witnesses. I also note that net worth schedules were not attached to either Reply.\n[13] The following information serves as the context in which the Appellants were reassessed and grounds these appeals. In filing his returns for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years, Tim Fuhr reported income of $25,000, $100,549 and $141,762 respectively (Exhibit A-2, Tabs 7-9; I note that these amounts vary slightly from the amounts found in different parts of the Reply). The Minister performed net worth and bank deposit analyses on Tim Fuhr\u2019s household and found that he had personal expenses of $429,539, $908,173 and $1,393,603 for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively (see Exhibit A-2, Tab 10). In response to a proposal letter, Tim Fuhr provided information that caused the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to make some adjustments to the net worth. In the end, Tim Fuhr was reassessed for unreported income and benefits in the amounts of $211,522, $469,466 and $537,085 for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively.\n[14] Tim Fuhr was the manager of Overtime, a restaurant and bar owned and operated by 1499. As mentioned earlier, Tim Fuhr was not a shareholder of 1499 but he was its sole director. In addition, he was the sole shareholder of UL which was a shareholder of 1499. I understood that at one time, Fuhr Holdings Ltd., an investment company owned by Tim Fuhr, his mother and his sisters, was a shareholder of 1499. During the relevant years, Overtime had sales of over 2 million dollars but ended up with a small profit of about $44,000 in 1499\u2019s 2012 taxation year and a deficit of about $25,000 in its 2013 taxation year. 1499 was reassessed for unreported income on the basis that Tim Fuhr\u2019s unreported income must have come from funds obtained from 1499, as well as for disallowed business expenses for each of its 2012 and 2013 taxation years.\n[15] Tim Fuhr\u2019s mother, Jeannette Fuhr, passed away on December 12, 2012. He testified that before she passed away, his mother\u2019s estate was valued at around 11 million dollars. Because Jeannette Fuhr had dementia, Tim Fuhr and his two sisters had power of attorney. Gifts were made to Jeannette Fuhr\u2019s children before she died. Tim Fuhr stated all three siblings agreed on amounts paid out of the estate but that he did not keep track of those amounts. Tim Fuhr testified that in 2011, he received about $225,000, and in the early part of 2012, he received $1,000,000 in addition to a cheque for $500,000.\n[16] When Jeannette Fuhr died, Tim Fuhr and his two sisters became executors of her estate, which was worth over $6.6 million. Tim Fuhr testified that he and his sisters received about $2.2 million each.\n[17] It is not disputed that Tim Fuhr received money from his mother\u2019s estate but the parties do not agree on the amounts so received. Tim Fuhr\u2019s gifts and inheritance from his mother\u2019s estate form a crucial part of his explanation for the discrepancy between his reported income and his personal expenditures.\nIV. Reassessments Beyond the Normal Reassessment Period [18] In addressing the first issue in these appeals, the Court must determine whether the Minister was justified in reassessing the Appellants beyond the normal reassessment period for the relevant taxation years.\nThe Applicable Law\n[19] Subsection 152(4) of the ITA sets out the Minister\u2019s right to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period determined under subsection 152(3.1). More specifically relevant to this appeal, subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) provides as follows:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a)the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n152 (4) Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie ou donner avis par \u00e9crit qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 toute personne qui a produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants :\na)le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration :\n(i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\n[20] Under subsection 152(4), the Minister bears the burden of establishing both that the Appellants made a misrepresentation and that it is attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud. In these appeals, the Minister has not alleged fraud.\n[21] In MF Electric Incorporated v R, 2023 TCC 60, at paras 31-33 [MF Electric], I discussed the principles which I believe should apply to the determination of whether the Minister is justified in reassessing beyond the normal reassessment period, as follows:\n[31] The wording of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) is such that it is sufficient for the Minister to establish neglect or carelessness without having to consider whether there was wilful default or fraud (see Deyab v Canada, 2020 FCA 222 at paras 58-61 [Deyab]). Having said this, the burden is on the Minister to establish both that the taxpayer or the person filing the return has made a misrepresentation and that it is attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud (see Vine v R, 2015 FCA 125 at paras 23-24).\n[32] The Minister\u2019s burden is to establish that there has been a misrepresentation at the time the return is filed. In commenting on the issue of timing in Nesbitt v Canada, 96 DTC 6588 at para 8, the Federal Court of Appeal expressed its view of the purpose of subsection 152(4) as follows:\nIt appears to me that one purpose of subsection 152(4) is to promote careful and accurate completion of income tax returns. Whether or not there is misrepresentation through neglect or carelessness in the completion of a return is determinable at the time the return is filed. A misrepresentation has occurred if there is an incorrect statement on the return form, at least one that is material to the purposes of the return and to any future reassessment. It remains a misrepresentation even if the Minister could or does, by a careful analysis of the supporting material, perceive the error on the return form. It would undermine the self-reporting nature of the tax system if taxpayers could be careless in the completion of returns while providing accurate basic data in working papers, on the chance that the Minister would not find the error but, if he did within four years, the worst consequence would be a correct reassessment at that time.\n[Underlining added]\n[33] Courts have consistently held that the threshold for establishing misrepresentation is low. In support of this view, in Francis & Associates v R, 2014 TCC 137 at para 20, Justice Bocock wrote as follows:\nA misrepresentation is any statement that is \u201cincorrect.\u201d: Minister of National Revenue v. Foot, [1964] C.T.C. 317 (Can. Ex. Ct.). Also, several cases have indicated that \u201cany\u201d error made in a return filed is tantamount to a misrepresentation, Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, [1961] C.T.C. 211 (Can. Ex. Ct.), Nesbitt v. R., and Ridge Run Developments Inc. v. R., [2007] 3 C.T.C. 2605 (T.C.C. [General Procedure]). Therefore, the threshold to establish a misrepresentation is low.\n[\u2026]\n[35] [\u2026] Courts have found that \u201cwhere a taxpayer thoughtfully, deliberately and carefully assesses the situation and files on what he believes bona fide to be the proper method there can be no misrepresentation as contemplated by section 152\u201d (see Regina Shoppers Mall Ltd v R [1991] F.C.J. No 52 (FCA) at para 7 [Regina Shoppers]). [\u2026]\n[36] To borrow the words of Justice Muldoon in Reilly v R, [1984] CTC 21 at para 51 (FCTD), \u201cwisdom is not infallibility and prudence is not perfection\u201d. However, in the present case, the Appellant has fallen far short of exercising reasonable care (see Venne v R, [1984] FCJ No 314 (FCTD) at para 16). In Regina Shoppers, supra at para 7, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed that it had been established \u201cthat the care that must be exercised must be that of a wise and prudent person and that the report must be made in a manner that the taxpayer truly believes to be correct\u201d. [\u2026]\n[22] With these principles in mind, I turn to the issue of misrepresentation in these appeals.\nMisrepresentation by 1499\n[23] The Minister reassessed 1499 to include unreported income of $316,696 and $395,502 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively. My understanding is that the Minister based this assessment on the net worth and bank deposit analyses of Tim Fuhr and more specifically on the discrepancy between his reported household income and significant personal expenditures. It does not appear that a net worth analysis was performed on 1499. At the hearing, there was no evidence of a net worth analysis conducted with respect to 1499, neither were there net worth schedules, nor any witnesses to testify that one had been conducted. The Respondent submitted that the unreported income represents revenue earned by 1499 but appropriated by or paid to Fuhr.\n[24] When making her submissions on the issue of misrepresentation, counsel for the Respondent focussed on Tim Fuhr and on the discrepancy between \u201cthe money coming in\u201d and \u201cthe verifiable documentary evidence showing that money went out\u201d and stated, \u201cthat was the misrepresentation\u201d (see Transcript, January 16, 2023, at p 105 [Transcript Day 2]). Counsel went through the numbers, acknowledging that these had changed during the hearing. I note that a review of the transcript reveals a complete focus on the alleged misrepresentation by Tim Fuhr such that in over twenty pages of discussion of the numbers there is not one mention of 1499 (see Transcript Day 2 at pp 105-128). In discussing the appropriateness of using the net worth method in the circumstances, the Respondent submitted it was their position that the money that came into Tim Fuhr\u2019s hands, but that could not be accounted for, came from 1499. Counsel stated, \u201c[t]he Respondent recognizes this is the weak link in the case. The specific tying of this unreported income in Mr. Fuhr\u2019s hands to 149 is difficult. [\u2026] The best I can do is offer possibilities\u201d (Transcript Day 2 at p 128).\n[25] The Respondent acknowledged the weak link in their position. I find it to be a fatally weak link. Assuming that the Respondent can show that Tim Fuhr made misrepresentations and had unreported income, an issue I will address below, the Respondent has introduced no evidence to show that the unreported income in Tim Fuhr\u2019s hands necessarily came from 1499. In light of the evidence, although somewhat incomplete, about other corporations, including Fuhr Holdings Ltd., Fuhr Farms Ltd. and UL, the money could have come from his involvement in any one of these corporations or from somewhere else for that matter. Counsel went on to suggest ways in which the money could have flowed from 1499 to Tim Fuhr but I find that these were pure conjecture. The Respondent suggested that there was a possibility that the work done by the bookkeeper for 1499, the work product on which Mr. Herbert relied to prepare 1499\u2019s financial statements and income tax returns, contained misrepresentations.\n[26] Mr. Herbert\u2019s testimony about his involvement as the external accountant for 1499 was unwavering. He expressed his view that the internal bookkeeper was a good bookkeeper with whom he continued to work on different files. Mr. Herbert stated that 1499\u2019s books and records were very complete, the bank statements properly reconciled. Mr. Herbert testified that the bookkeeper would put together a binder including a complete copy of the general ledger and accounting records. He added that he would not do a deep dive into the monthly sales reconciliations, as the cost of doing so would be prohibitive but that he did look at things on an aggregate basis. Mr. Herbert would then have a conversation with Tim Fuhr, going over the financial statements and what was trending. Mr. Herbert was not involved in any way with Fuhr Farms Ltd. or Fuhr Holdings Ltd. nor with the Fuhr family trust.\n[27] When asked whether he ever saw instances of unreported income, Mr. Herbert candidly replied that it might be difficult to see, as he was not doing the bookkeeping. However, he asserted that 1499 had a sophisticated point-of-sale system and that when analyzing the financial statements and looking at revenue and cost of goods sold, he did not see anything in terms of wild fluctuations in gross margins. It did not appear to him that any funds were taken out.\n[28] In reassessing 1499, the Minister also disallowed the deduction of business expenses in the amount of $141,119 and $99,865 for the 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively. These expenses were disallowed on the basis that they were not incurred at all, were not incurred for the purpose of gaining income or were personal in nature, and in particular because there was no supporting documentation. According to read-ins introduced by the Appellants at trial, the CRA appeals officer was repeatedly asked the following question, or a variation thereof, regarding various expenses: \u201cCan you confirm that the only reason for the disallowance of these expenses was that no supporting documents were provided to the auditor?\u201d (Exhibit A-3, Appellant\u2019s Read-ins at pp 17-21 [Read- ins]). She responded yes every time. For 2013, the appeals officer confirmed that, with respect to some expenses, the auditor simply took the percentage of expenses disallowed in 2012 and applied it to 2013. I note that a lack of documentation supporting expenses is not in and of itself proof that the expenses were not incurred or that they were not incurred for the purpose of gaining income. The Respondent introduced no evidence to support a finding that the expenses deducted were improper. In fact, I find that the evidence introduced through the testimony of Mr. Herbert provides sufficient support for the deductibility of the interest expense as well as the vehicle expenses for both the 2012 and 2013 taxation years.\n[29] In addition, pursuant to subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) of the ITA, a finding of misrepresentation does not justify reopening statute-barred taxation years to reassess any or all amounts of income or expenses that were assessed. Subsection 152(4.01)(a)(i) provides that a reassessment under subsection 152(4) may be made to the extent, but only to the extent, that it can reasonably be regarded as relating to a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud. If I were to find that there was misrepresentation regarding some business expenses, it would only justify reopening a taxation year to make adjustments that can reasonably be regarded as relating to the matters for which the taxpayer has misled the Minister.\n[30] As explained by Justice Bowie in Hans v R (2003 TCC 576 at para 8):\n[s]ubparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) creates an exception to permit reassessment in those cases in which the taxpayer has misled the Minister. Subparagraph 152(4.01)(a)(i) was enacted to ensure that the effect of any such reassessment is confined to those matters as to which the taxpayer has misled the Minister. In other words, proof that the taxpayer misled the Minister as to one category of expenses does not become a licence for the Minister to disallow some or all of the expenses of another category that were allowed in arriving at the previous assessment, and require that the taxpayer discharge the onus of proving each one of them on appeal.\n[31] I adopt the words of Chief Justice Bowman, as he then was, in Mensah v R (2008 TCC 378 at para 9) and find that precisely what misrepresentation 1499 is alleged to have made was not established with any degree of specificity, or for that matter, at all. I find that, based on the credible testimony of Mr. Herbert, 1499 kept good books and records such that if the Respondent wanted to attack the numbers in 1499\u2019s income tax returns, it had to provide the Court with evidence that those books and records were not reflective of the real numbers. Bald assertions that 1499 misrepresented its income on the basis that the alleged unreported income of Tim Fuhr must have come from unreported income of 1499 are insufficient. Bald assertions that 1499 made misrepresentations based on a lack of documentation provided to the auditor in support of the business expenses claimed are insufficient, especially in light of the testimony of Mr. Herbert that supported some of the expenses.\nConclusion on Reassessing Beyond the Normal Reassessment Period \u2013 1499\n[32] I find that the Respondent has not presented sufficient evidence in support of a finding that 1499 made a misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default in filing its income tax returns. As acknowledged by the Respondent, the assumption that any reported income by Tim Fuhr had to come from 1499 was a weak link in its case. I conclude that the Respondent has not satisfied its burden to justify reassessing 1499 beyond the normal reassessment period such that 1499\u2019s appeals for its 2012 and 2013 taxation years are allowed with costs against the Respondent.\nMisrepresentation by Tim Fuhr\n[33] I now turn to whether the Minister was justified in reassessing Tim Fuhr beyond the normal reassessment period for his 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years.\n[34] Clearly, the income Tim Fuhr reported in his income tax returns in the amounts of $25,000, $100,549 and $141,762 for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years respectively, together with the income reported by his spouse, are insufficient to support the household\u2019s personal expenses of $429,539, $908,173 and $1,393,603 respectively, as established by the net worth analysis (Exhibit A-2, Tab 10). During cross-examination, Tim Fuhr acknowledged that, at the audit stage, he did not make any representations to the CRA to suggest that the expenditure amounts were wildly inaccurate (Transcript, January 15, 2024, at p 163 [Transcript Day 1]. In addition, at trial, when reviewing a few specific larger expenses in the executive summary of the net worth and cross-checking them with the list of specific personal expenditures, Tim Fuhr recognized the amounts as expenses he did make, for example, for a private jet and for other trips (Transcript, Day 1 at pp 176-183). In response to cross-examination questions regarding the summaries of personal expenditures by category, Tim Fuhr testified that the numbers seemed reasonable to him. In fairness, I note that there are 162 pages listing personal expenditures made over three years, including many for less than $10 to $50 such that taking issue with all those amounts would have been a monumental task.\n[35] Tim Fuhr\u2019s position is that the money he claims to have received from his mother\u2019s estate explains the discrepancy between the household income reported and the much larger personal expenditures. However, the evidence, both viva voce and documentary, regarding the amounts he received from his mother, both before and after she passed away, is inadequate and unreliable.\n[36] For example, Tim Fuhr could not remember receiving a cheque from his mother for a half a million dollars dated May 29, 2012, even though he co-signed the cheque. He could not remember a July 2013 cheque for $266,666 from his mother\u2019s estate that he also co-signed. Nor did he have any recollection of a bank draft dated April 1, 2011, for $225,000 to the order of Tim Fuhr from an account held by his mother at the Canadian Western Bank (Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2, Tab 18).\n[37] Tim Fuhr remembered receiving a cheque for $1,000,000. But there was no documentary evidence to support the existence of a cheque or bank draft to the order of Tim Fuhr for $1,000,000. Tim Fuhr testified that his two sisters had also received $1,000,000 and that he and his sisters had authorized the million-dollar payments. Neither of Tim Fuhr\u2019s sisters testified. When asked what he would have done with the million-dollar bank draft, Tim Fuhr replied that he could not remember. In cross-examination, Tim Fuhr was asked whether he received a cheque for $1,000,000 in addition to the cheque for $500,000 received in May of 2012, bringing the total to $1.5 million, or whether he was perhaps mistaken and had received only one cheque for half a million dollars. He replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure there was another million\u201d (Transcript Day 1 at p 143-144). The uncertainty in his answer does not inspire a lot of confidence in support of the existence of another cheque or bank draft for $1 million.\n[38] Although much time has passed between the relevant events and the hearing, such that it might be difficult to remember details of exactly what transpired, I find that it is unlikely that one would not remember a little bit more about transfers in such significant amounts. The answer to the question of whether Tim Fuhr received a cheque or bank draft for half a million dollars or whether he received one for half a million dollars and one for one million in 2012 remains elusive.\n[39] Before determining whether Tim Fuhr made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default, I must take a closer look at the evidence introduced at trial regarding the alleged amounts of unreported income.\nUnreported Income and Shareholder Benefits \u2013 Tim Fuhr\n[40] Counsel for Tim Fuhr argued that the use of the net worth method was not appropriate in this case. I find that the following pronouncement from the Federal Court of Appeal in Lacroix v Canada (2008 FCA 241) addresses this issue head on:\n[18] In my view, this jurisprudence does not establish a rule to the effect that the Minister may not use the net worth method to add unreported income to a taxpayer\u2019s income unless the Minister can establish the source of the unreported income. Our tax collection system is based on the taxpayer\u2019s self-reporting of the income he or she has earned during a taxation year. Should the Minister doubt, for whatever reason, the accuracy of the taxpayer\u2019s return, the Minister may conduct an investigation in such manner as deemed necessary. The Minister may then make a reassessment. [\u2026]\n[Underlining added]\nIn my view, the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s statement in Lacroix quoted above is sufficient to support my finding that the Minister was justified in conducting a net worth analysis in the circumstances of this case wherein the Minister had reason to doubt the accuracy of Tim Fuhr\u2019s income tax returns.\n[41] According to the proposal letter, the CRA made adjustments to the net worth calculations on the basis of information Tim Fuhr provided regarding shareholder loan accounts, noting that he did not provide the required additional support for the inheritance amounts he claimed to have received. Unlike the taxpayer in Mensah, supra, Tim Fuhr did not keep \u201cmeticulous records\u201d. The documentary evidence regarding deposits in his bank accounts and what he did with the various cheques or bank drafts received was inadequate, his oral evidence in this respect, unreliable.\n[42] Counsel for the Appellants argued that the obligation to keep adequate books and records is not the same for a taxpayer earning employment income as that of a taxpayer earning business income. However, since Tim Fuhr\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy between the household\u2019s reported income and the personal expenditures relies completely on the existence of funds received from his mother, he would have had to provide adequate documentation and\/or credible oral evidence of his having received those very funds.\n[43] I adopt the words of Justice Bowman, as he then was, in Ramey v R (93 DTC 791 at para 6), wherein he asserted that the net worth method is a blunt instrument providing an unsatisfactory and imprecise way of estimating income and net worth assessments may be inaccurate within a range of indeterminate magnitude (see also Mensah, supra at para 5).\n[44] The evidence in this case does show that the net worth analysis is flawed in some respects such that some of the amounts assessed as unreported income are not justified. I will address the evidence and submissions of the parties regarding the reassessments for each of the three taxation years in issue. In light of the differences between the taxation years, I will address the taxation years out of order, beginning with the 2012 taxation year.\nThe 2012 Taxation Year\n[45] On the basis of the answer to an undertaking made at discovery, the Respondent conceded that the shareholder draws in the amount of $321,649.31 should not have been included in the personal expenditures (Exhibit A-3, Tab 2 and Transcript Day 2 at p 109). This significantly reduced the personal expenditures for 2012 from $908,173 to $586,524 (Exhibit A-3, Tab 1). Respondent\u2019s counsel stated that accounting for this reduced amount in personal expenditures, adding the increase of around $128,000 in the shareholder loan account and subtracting the reported income and the amounts received from his mother more than accounts for the alleged unreported income and the shareholder benefits assessed. In light of the Respondent\u2019s concession and submissions, I find that Tim Fuhr did not make any misrepresentations in the filing of his 2012 return. This is sufficient to allow the appeal of Tim Fuhr for the 2012 taxation year, with costs against the Respondent.\nThe 2011 Taxation Year\n[46] With respect to the 2011 taxation year, the Minister reassessed Tim Fuhr to include unreported income in the amount of $211,522. At audit, when doing the net worth analysis, the Minister was aware that Tim Fuhr had a bank draft dated April 1, 2011, in the amount of $225,000 issued from Jeannette Fuhr\u2019s Canadian Western Bank account. It appears that the auditor treated $25,000 of the $225,000 as part of his inheritance but not the balance because they could not trace where it had been deposited (see Read-ins at p 29). The Respondent\u2019s brief submissions on this issue are not straightforward. Counsel for the Respondent stated as follows (Transcript Day 2 at p 110):\nTurning, then, to the inheritance side of it, the non-taxable source of funds, the evidence concerning the $225,000 cheque is before the Court. I don't have any specific instructions to concede on that point, but I don't intend to raise an argument about the exclusion of the $200,000.\n[47] I hasten to add that I did not hear any evidence on the appropriateness of the auditor\u2019s decision to treat two portions of the bank draft differently.\n[48] In light of the bank draft and the parties\u2019 submissions, I find that Tim Fuhr received $225,000 from his mother in April 2011 and that the whole amount, as opposed to only $25,000, must be treated as a non-taxable source of income. Counsel for the Respondent made some quick on the spot calculations and suggested as follows (Transcript Day 2 at p 113):\nTaking the personal expenses of $430,000, approximately, less the $225,000 of inheritance, less the reported income of approximately a hundred and twenty\u2011thousand dollars, we are left with a shortfall of $85,057.\nIt appears that those calculations fail to take into account other adjustments made in the net worth analysis. In my view, the more appropriate way to calculate any amount still in dispute is to start with the Respondent\u2019s assumption that Tim Fuhr failed to report income in the amount of 211,522 and account for a reduction of $200,000 (the portion of the $225,000 bank draft from his mother that was not treated as a gift). This leaves a balance of unreported income assessed for 2011 of $11,522.\nThe 2013 Taxation Year\n[49] Based on the concession made at discovery and discussed above, the Respondent further conceded that shareholder draws in the amount of $245,763.67 should not have been included in the personal expenditures for 2013 (Exhibit A-3, Tab 2 and Transcript Day 2 at pp 109-110). This significantly reduced the personal expenditures for 2013 from $1,393,603 to $1,147,839.\n[50] The Respondent attempted the same type of calculation as that for the 2011 taxation year discussed above. According to those loose, on the spot, calculations and starting with the new amount of $1,147,839 for personal expenditures for 2013, adding the increase in the shareholder loan account and subtracting the inheritance cheques for about $1.5 million and the reported household income of about $285,000, we are left with a shortfall of $293,572. I am not confident that these calculations do not suffer from the same type of error as I found existed for the 2011 taxation year such that the shortfall as calculated by the Respondent would likely be lower.\nConclusion on Reassessing Beyond the Normal Reassessment Period \u2013 Tim Fuhr\n[51] I do not accept Tim Fuhr\u2019s testimony that he received a cheque or bank draft for $1,000,000 in addition to the cheque for $500,000 in 2012, before his mother passed away. His oral testimony on this issue defied common sense and credibility. There was no documentation to support this assertion and no other witness testimony to assist. However, the existence of this additional million dollars is less critical to his explanation for the discrepancy between the household income reported and personal expenditures as there is no longer a discrepancy that even comes close to that amount for the three taxation years combined.\n[52] Having said this, I reiterate that the Minister must meet its burden to show that Tim Fuhr has made misrepresentations and that they are attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. I find that the Minister has not done so.\n[53] After a careful review of the evidence, I find that the net worth analysis, which underlies the reassessments of Tim Fuhr, is seriously flawed. It is so deficient that the amount in dispute for 2011 is reduced from more than $200,000 to $11,000, very loosely calculated. What is more, it is so deficient that the Respondent has conceded that there is now no amount of unreported income for 2012. In addition, I find that the evidence introduced through the testimony of Mr. Herbert has provided sufficient credible information to support a finding that the auditor was incorrect in its treatment of the vehicle benefit amounts included in the reassessments for 2012 and 2013. Although the vehicle benefit represents a small amount relative to other amounts in issue, it adds to the erosion of the confidence one might have in the analysis that was intended to support the reassessments in these appeals. I hasten to add that Mr. Herbert\u2019s testimony revealed other errors, which further contribute to this erosion.\n[54] The Respondent has not pointed to misrepresentations made by Tim Fuhr in filing his income tax returns with any degree of specificity and soundness to support a finding of misrepresentation by this Court. Hence, I find that the Minister was not justified in reassessing Tim Fuhr beyond the normal reassessment period such that his appeals for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years are allowed with costs against the Respondent.\nV. Penalties \u2013 Tim Fuhr [55] Pursuant to subsection 163(2) of the ITA, the Respondent has the burden of establishing the facts that justify the assessment of a penalty. I note that the Respondent made no submissions on the penalties imposed on Tim Fuhr. In any event, in light of the findings above, the assessment of penalties is no longer in issue.\nVI. Conclusion [56] The appeals from the reassessments of Tim Fuhr for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years are allowed with costs against the Respondent.\n[57] The appeals from the reassessments of 1499546 Alberta Ltd. for its taxation years ending September 30, 2012, and 2013 are allowed with costs against the Respondent.\n[58] The parties shall have 30 days from the date of this judgment to reach an agreement on costs and to so advise the Court, failing which the Appellants shall have a further 20 days to serve and file written submissions on costs and the Respondent shall have a further 20 days to serve and file a written response. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten (10) pages in length. If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received within the applicable time limits, costs shall be awarded to the Appellants in accordance with the Tariff.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 11th day of April 2024.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 43\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-3217(IT)G\n2019-3215(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTIM FUHR AND HIS MAJESTY THE KING\n1499546 ALBERTA LTD.

In turn, the Minister confirmed the Applicant\u2019s 2005 reassessment by notice of confirmation dated June 22, 2022 (\u201cconfirmation\u201d). The Applicant admits he received the confirmation by mail likely no more than 2 days later. The Applicant did not file a notice of appeal within the 90 days as was his right under subsection 169(1) of the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d).\n[3] Subsequently, the Applicant\u2019s present agent sent a notice of application to extend the time to file an appeal (\u201cextension application\u201d), together with an attached notice of appeal, to the TCC Registry in Vancouver. The Applicant asserts that the extension application was faxed on September 20, 2023 at 20:24 (8:24 p.m.). An Applicant produced facsimile transmission record in the agent\u2019s possession appears to confirm this. That record referenced 13 pages and took 7 minutes and 58 seconds to transmit. Therefore, the Applicant argues the extension application, in its entirety, was physically in the TCC registry office as evidenced by virtue of the fax transmission report on September 20, 2023 at 20:32 (8:32 p.m.). Sometime the next morning, court registry staff date stamped the extension application as filed, when next in the office, on September 21, 2023.\nFiling Notice of Appeal and Extension Requests\n[4] The parties do not dispute these facts; the parties do however dispute the \u201ceffective\u201d date of the confirmation and the filing date of the extension application. Both do so because of the specifically applicable deadlines for filing the extension application.\n[5] Subsection 169(1) of the ITA provides that the taxpayer may appeal a confirmed reassessment, but states no appeal may be initiated if 90 days have elapsed after the confirmation notice has been \u201csent\u201d to the taxpayer.\n[6] If the taxpayer misses the 90 day period, there is another operative period, a one year grace period. Subsection 167(1) provides that such an extension application may be brought to the Tax Court. Subsection 167(3) states that an extension application is made \u201cby filing \u2026 [the extension application]\u2026 in the Registry of the Tax Court\u2026 in accordance with\u2026 the Tax Court of Canada Act.\u201d Upon so filing the extension application, the Tax Court may grant an order extending the time and receiving the notice of appeal, provided however the applicant satisfies certain conditions.\n[7] These conditions are both temporal and qualitative. The temporal or time deadline is mandatory. Subsection 167(5), and specifically paragraph 167(5)(a), state clearly that \u201cNo order [for extension] shall be made\u2026 unless the application is made within one year after the expiration... \u201d for filing the notice of appeal (see subsection 169(1) in paragraph 5 above).\nWhy the Dates Matter Most In This Application\n[8] And now to the dates concerning this extension application. If the effective date of the notice of confirmation was June 22, 2022, the 90 days under s. 169 expired on September 20, 2022. From that date, the Applicant, under 167(5)(a) was required to \u201cfile\u201d his extension application within one year after September 20, 2022: September 20, 2023. As described above, the TCC Registry memorialized the \u201cfiling\u201d of the extension application, per its stamp, on September 21, 2023. That was the day after September 20, 2023, the Minister\u2019s asserted deadline. If these dates are correct, the extension application is out of time. Hence the hearing of this application.\nLegal Positions of the Parties\nApplicant\n[9] The Applicant\u2019s agent argues the extension application was on time for two reasons, each in the alternative.\nTCC\u2019s Receipt date of extension application\n[10] First, the agent contends that the extension application was sent by fax, in its entirety, on September 20, 2023. The Tax Court of Canada Rules (the \u201cRules\u201d) provide for filing by fax. Subsection 4.2(a) provides as follows:\n4.2 Except as otherwise provided in these Rules and unless otherwise directed by the Court, the date of filing of a document is deemed to be\n(a) in the case of a document filed with the Registry or sent by mail or by fax, the date shown by the date received stamp placed on the document by the Registry at the time it is received; or\n[11] The extension application was physically received by the Tax Court Registry on September 20, 2023. This simply reflects the reality: a faxed copy of the extension application was sent by fax to the Tax Court Registry on that date.\nSending date of confirmation\n[12] Second, the Applicant asserts that the confirmation notice was received by the Applicant no earlier than June 24, 2022. It was sent by express post. It is not factually certain when precisely the confirmation was physically sent. It is known that the confirmation was dated June 22, 2022. Its ultimate receipt by the Applicant is not disputed, just its actual deemed \u201csending\u201d date.\n[13] Logically, the Applicant contends if the deemed sending date is even June 23, 2022, then the applicable 90 days later would be September 21, 2023 (s. 169) and the applicable last date one year later would be September 21, 2022 (ss. 167(5)). The TCC Registry, even by its own notation, filed the extension application on September 21, 2023.\nRespondent\n[14] In response, the Respondent contends the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Rules are clear: the extension application was filed on September 21, 2023 and is out of time. The Court lacks discretion to accept an out of time extension application. Respondent\u2019s counsel did not address the Applicant\u2019s argument concerning alleged uncertainty of the date the confirmation notice was sent.\nIssues\n[15] The issues before the Court are, on what date at law:\na)was the extension application filed with the TCC Registry (\u201capplication filing date\u201d); and,\nb)was the confirmation notice sent by the Minister and deemed received by the Applicant (\u201csending date of confirmation\u201d), respectively?\na)Analysis and Decision: Application Filing Date\nLegislation\n[16] The applicable Tax Court of Canada Rules (Informal Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d) provide in sections 4.1 and 4.2 as follows:\nFiling of Other Documents\n4.1 Except as otherwise provided in these Rules and unless otherwise directed by the Court, a document other than a notice of appeal may be filed using one of the following methods:\n(a) depositing it with the Registry;\n(b) sending it by mail to the Registry; or\n(c) sending it by fax or by electronic filing to the Registry.\nFiling Date\n4.2 Except as otherwise provided in these Rules and unless otherwise directed by the Court, the date of filing a document is deemed to be\n(a) in the case of a document filed with the Registry or sent by mail or by fax, the date shown by the date received stamp placed on the document by the Registry at the time it is received; or\n(b) in the case of a document filed by electronic filing, the date shown on the acknowledgement of receipt issued by the Court\nInterpretation\n[17] While no prior authorities have specifically addressed sections Rule 4.1 or Rule 4.2 above, the use of similar language has been previously considered.\n[18] The case of Covic v MNR[1] concerned a similar issue where an application was stamped by the registry three days after the deadline. In that case, Justice Woods held that the deadline was missed. In doing so, Justice Woods applied Rules 5(2) and 5.2 of the Canada Pension Plan Rules of the Tax Court. These are the variants of Rule 4.2 above but applicable to the Canada Pension Plan.\n[19] The Court notes a curious distinction. Rule 4.1 groups e-filing and fax together in the same subsection for service of documents. However, under Rule 4.2, these methods of service are separated, with service via fax being assigned the date when the Registry Office stamps the fax. In contrast, e-filed documents are deemed to be filed on the date shown on the acknowledgment of receipt as issued by the Court.\n[20] The Court can rationalize the distinction. First, there is a logical basis for treating the faxing of documents and e-filing of documents differently regarding the deemed filing date. Under Rule 4.2 (a) faxed documents are to be deemed as filed on the date when they are stamped by the Registry Office. This logically follows since a fax is in paper format and cannot be automatically filed within a document registry system. Whereas, instantaneous filing into the registry system of a document in digital format can occur for an e-filed document. Selectively, the Applicant\u2019s agent chose to file the application via fax after business hours, leaving the Registry Office unable to stamp the application on September 20, 2023, without further physical act of retrieving it from the fax machine. This is akin to opening an envelope and stamping the confirmation, if sent by mail.\n[21] The Rules are clear that the filing date can only be deemed through two forms of evidence depending on the mode of transmission: (i) the stamp of the registry office for mail or fax, or (ii) the acknowledgment receipt issued by the Court for e-filed documents. Neither the Applicant nor his agent received from the Court either of these forms of evidence with a date that would have been within the filing deadline for the extension application. Of critical importance is the fact that the extension application was faxed, not e-filed.\n[22] Lastly, the words \u201cunless otherwise directed by the Court\u201d in the preamble of the Rules s. 4.1 and 4.2, appear at first glance to give the Court broad powers to override the deeming provisions which follow in the sections, if this Court sees fit. The Applicant\u2019s agent argues the discretion should be applied because he faxed the extension application to the Court on a \u201cwithin time\u201d date. This is insufficient for two reasons: (i) The Rules are clear as they relate to receipt of faxes; and, the date filed is deemed to be the date stamped by the Registry Office.\n[23] As well, the exception states \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in these Rules and unless otherwise directed by the Court, the date of filing\u2026 is deemed to be\u2026\u201d This wording is clearly conjunctive. The Rules must \u201cotherwise provide\u201d so that the Court may apply its discretion and otherwise direct. To be succinct, the Rules do not \u201cotherwise provide\u201d and therefore the Court may not \u201cotherwise direct\u201d.\n[24] On this basis, the filing date for the extension application was, as indicated by the TCC court registry, September 21, 2023.\na)Analysis and Decision: Sending Date of Confirmation\nLegislation\n[25] The ITA is operable concerning the sending date of the confirmation because that document was sent under the authority of that Act. Subsections 244(14), (15) and subsection 248(7) address the issue of sending and dates received.\nMailing or sending date\n(14) For the purposes of this Act, where any notice or notification described in subsection 149.1(6.3), 152(3.1), 165(3) or 166.1(5) or any notice of assessment or determination is mailed, or sent electronically, it shall be presumed to be mailed or sent, as the case may be, on the date of that notice or notification.\nDate when assessment made\n(15) If any notice of assessment or determination has been sent by the Minister as required by this Act, the assessment or determination is deemed to have been made on the day of sending of the notice of the assessment or determination.\nDeemed receipt when sent by mail\n(7) For the purposes of this Act,\n(a) anything (other than a remittance or payment described in paragraph 248(7)(b)) sent by first class mail or its equivalent shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it was sent on the day it was mailed; and\n(b) the remittance or payment of an amount\n(i) deducted or withheld, or\n(ii) payable by a corporation,\nas required by this Act or a regulation shall be deemed to have been made on the day on which it is received by the Receiver General.\nInterpretation by jurisprudence\n[26] The Minister bears the duty under sections 165 and 169 of the Act to notify the taxpayer of assessments and confirmations. This usually means the mailing of such notifications. The Minister is not required to undertake personal service or even ensure the notification is \u201creceived\u201d by the taxpayer; sending a notice by mail is sufficient for the Minister to fulfill her obligations.[2]\n[27] Paragraph 248(7)(a) of the Act is a deeming provision that deems a taxpayer has received a notice from the Minister on the day it was mailed so long as it was sent by first class mail.[3] The deeming provision under paragraph 248(7)(a) is not a rebuttable presumption.[4] Subsection 244(14) of the Act presumes the date of mailing to be the same date as the date appearing on the notice. Schafer further stands for the proposition that where a notice is found to have been mailed the time count begins regardless of when, or for that matter if, it was received by a taxpayer.[5]\n[28] In 741290 Ontario, Justice Rossiter (as he then was) summarized the intersection of subsection 244(14) and paragraph 248(7)(a) of the Act with regard to deeming a taxpayer\u2019s receipt of a notice:\n[14] With respect to mailing, there are several statutory provisions that ease the evidentiary burden on the Respondent to establish that limitation periods have been triggered.\n[15] Subsection 244(14) of the ITA states that where a Notice of Assessment has been mailed it is presumed to be mailed on the date on the Notice of Assessment\n[16] Also, if the assessment was sent by first class mail the ITA deems it to be received by the taxpayer on the date it was sent pursuant to subsection 248(7)\n[17] The presumption that something was received on the date it was mailed is not rebuttable.[6]\n[emphasis added]\n[29] This Court in Laing made the following comments regarding paragraph 248(7)(a) and a taxpayer raising an argument of when a notice was actually received:\n\u201cthe only possibility for the Applicant to succeed would have been to establish that the notice of reassessment was not sent or mailed by the CRA on November 14, 2014. Otherwise, paragraph 248(7) ITA deems the notice to have been received and whether the notice is received by the taxpayer becomes irrelevant\u201d[7]\nInterpretation\n[30] The Applicant\u2019s argument concerning conformation date for calculation purposes under sections 169 or 167 of the ITA fails. The date imprinted on the confirmation stands unless the Applicant asserts the notice of confirmation was never sent. The Applicant does not assert that the confirmation was never sent, but merely that the date it was received is later than the date it bears. For the reasons stated, the date of receipt is not relevant.\nSummary\n[31] For the above reasons the TCC\u2019s receipt date of the extension application was September 21, 2023 and the sending date of the confirmation was June 22, 2022. Accordingly, the application is dismissed without costs.\nThis Amended Reasons for Order is issued in substitution for the Reasons for Order dated April 17, 2024.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 19th day of April, 2024.\n\u201cR.

That arrangement was incorporated into their divorce judgment in 2013. The father subsequently claimed to be a shared-custody parent and in 2019 the Canada Revenue Agency determined that the parents were shared-custody parents for the 2015 to 2017 benefit years. The result was an overpayment that was recovered from the mother. This is her appeal from that determination.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I conclude, based on the evidence presented to the Court, that the father is not a shared-custody parent and the mother is entitled to the full amount of the CCB.\nI. The Law\n[4] Section 122.6 of the Act defines the term \u201cshared-custody parent\u201d as follows:\nshared-custody parent in respect of a qualified dependant at a particular time means, where the presumption referred to in paragraph (f) of the definition eligible individual does not apply in respect of the qualified dependant, an individual who is one of the two parents of the qualified dependant who\n(a) are not at that time cohabitating spouses or common-law partners of each other,\n(b) reside with the qualified dependant either\n(i) at least 40% of the time in the month in which the particular time occurs, or\n(ii) on an approximately equal basis, and\n(c) primarily fulfil the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependant when residing with the qualified dependant, as determined in consideration of prescribed factors. (parent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e)\nparent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e S\u2019entend, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge admissible \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, dans le cas o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a f) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 celle-ci, du particulier qui est l\u2019un des deux parents de la personne \u00e0 charge qui, \u00e0 la fois :\na) ne sont pas, \u00e0 ce moment, des \u00e9poux ou conjoints de fait vis\u00e9s l\u2019un par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre;\nb) r\u00e9sident avec la personne \u00e0 charge :\n(i) soit au moins 40 % du temps au cours du mois qui comprend le moment donn\u00e9,\n(ii) soit sur une base d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 approximative;\nc) lorsqu\u2019ils r\u00e9sident avec la personne \u00e0 charge, assument principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de celle-ci, ainsi qu\u2019il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s des crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par r\u00e8glement. (shared-custody parent)\n[5] Section 6302 of the Income Tax Regulations, C.R.C. c. 945 (the \u201cRegulations\u201d) provides the following factors concerning care and upbringing:\nFor the purposes of paragraph (h) of the definition eligible individual in section 122.6 of the Act, the following factors are to be considered in determining what constitutes care and upbringing of a qualified dependant:\n(a) the supervision of the daily activities and needs of the qualified dependant;\n(b) the maintenance of a secure environment in which the qualified dependant resides;\n(c) the arrangement of, and transportation to, medical care at regular intervals and as required for the qualified dependant;\n(d) the arrangement of, participation in, and transportation to, educational, recreational, athletic or similar activities in respect of the qualified dependant;\n(e) the attendance to the needs of the qualified dependant when the qualified dependant is ill or otherwise in need of the attendance of another person;\n(f) the attendance to the hygienic needs of the qualified dependant on a regular basis;\n(g) the provision, generally, of guidance and companionship to the qualified dependant; and\n(h) the existence of a court order in respect of the qualified dependant that is valid in the jurisdiction in which the qualified dependant resides.\nPour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a h) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible \u00e0 l\u2019article 122.6 de la Loi, les crit\u00e8res suivants servent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer en quoi consistent le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge admissible :\na) le fait de surveiller les activit\u00e9s quotidiennes de la personne \u00e0 charge admissible et de voir \u00e0 ses besoins quotidiens;\nb) le maintien d\u2019un milieu s\u00e9curitaire l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9side;\nc) l\u2019obtention de soins m\u00e9dicaux pour elle \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers et en cas de besoin, ainsi que son transport aux endroits o\u00f9 ces soins sont offerts;\nd) l\u2019organisation pour elle d\u2019activit\u00e9s \u00e9ducatives, r\u00e9cr\u00e9atives, athl\u00e9tiques ou semblables, sa participation \u00e0 de telles activit\u00e9s et son transport \u00e0 cette fin;\ne) le fait de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins lorsqu\u2019elle est malade ou a besoin de l\u2019assistance d\u2019une autre personne;\nf) le fait de veiller \u00e0 son hygi\u00e8ne corporelle de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re;\ng) de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle et de la guider;\nh) l\u2019existence d\u2019une ordonnance rendue \u00e0 son \u00e9gard par un tribunal qui est valide dans la juridiction o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9side.\n[6] The father did not claim that custody was shared more or less equally; moreover, the evidence would not support such a claim. The legal issue that arises in this case is therefore whether the children resided at least 40% of the time with their father \u00adand whether, during that time, the father primarily fulfilled the responsibility for their care and upbringing as provided in section 6302 of the Regulations.\n[7] There is no precise method for apportioning the time the children spend in school in order to determine the 40% minimum custodial time or determine which parent primarily fulfilled the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the children during their days at school. Neither the Federal Court of Appeal nor the Tax Court of Canada has specified the precise calculation method that applies to school days. The calculation depends on the circumstances and the particular facts.\nII. The Facts\n1. Did the children reside with their father at least 40% of the time?\n[8] Both parents testified. The children spent every other weekend with their father and resided with him two nights a week, on weekdays. Their mother clearly stated that no change had been made to those periods, during which the father had access to the children, from the time they separated until 2018. In 2018, the father applied to the Superior Court of Quebec to have the 2013 divorce judgment varied, and he amended that application in 2019. No variation has been ordered to date. In his application, the father confirmed this arrangement and the fact that it had been in effect since the outset and continued until July 2018.\n[9] The mother stated that the children were with their father every second weekend from 9:00 a.m. Saturday until he dropped them off at school or her home on Monday morning before 9:00 a.m. The father stated that as he recalled, the children spent one day per weekend with him, not a full weekend every other week. However, his testimony was far from clear and coherent, and he was unable to recall a number of things. Given the unreliability of the father\u2019s testimony, I accept the mother\u2019s testimony where there is a discrepancy between the two (unless it is contrary to other credible evidence in the father\u2019s favour). In any event, the text that the father sent the mother on August 26, 2018, expressly confirmed that the arrangement provided for every other weekend, from 9:00 a.m. on Saturday to 9:00 a.m. on Monday. In that text, the father also confirmed that the two overnights a week would start at 5:15 p.m. and end at 9:00 the next morning. That also fits with the invitation and entries in his 2018 Outlook daily calendar, which was introduced in evidence, that show that the weekday overnights when he had the children started at 5:00 in the evening and ended at 8:30 a.m. the next day. There was other evidence that also supported this fact.\n[10] The appellant clearly stated in her testimony that the terms of the father\u2019s access to the children stayed the same during the children\u2019s summer holidays. In other words, the children continue to return to their mother\u2019s home at 9:00 Monday morning, every second weekend, and at 9:00 a.m. following the two weekday overnights while they were with their father.\n[11] According to the parents\u2019 calendar, every second week, one of the weekday overnights started on Monday between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. and ended on Tuesday morning. When the access from Monday evening to the next day started, the father did not pick the children up at school during the school year. The children first went to their mother\u2019s home after school.\n[12] The father\u2019s reliability was questioned because he was repeatedly unable to remember facts, including whether the children had spent every other weekend with him each year or had spent only one day per weekend with him; whether he had written the letter to his cousin stating the apparently incorrect number of days a week when, he said, she had seen him with the children; whether he was the author of the letter from his employer stating that it was not possible for him to work two days a week but without specifying whether he was not available only in the evening or for the entire day. As well, he was not able to recall whether he had worked on those days, and he stated that we was not able to recall the time of day when he picked the children up and dropped them off on weekdays in the summer.\n[13] The father made an incorrect statement to the Canada Revenue Agency in his application to be recognized as a shared-custody parent when he stated that his children resided with him for three full days out of seven per week. That raises doubts as to the credibility of what he told the Court.\n[14] I see no reason to consider the time the children spent in school every second Monday during the school year as time the children spent with their father. His access ended at 9:00 a.m. His Monday overnight did not start until 5:00 p.m. or even later, when the children, who had gone back to their mother\u2019s for a while, returned. During the summer holidays, the children did not spend time with their father during the day on Monday. I also see no reason to consider the weeknights the children spent with their father to be 24\u2011hour days.\n[15] I find that the preponderance of the evidence is not sufficient to establish that the children resided with their father at least 40% of the time.\n2. Care and upbringing\n[16] The father cared for his children when they were with him. During the weekday overnights, he had supper with them and prepared their school lunches for the next day. He made sure they had done their homework in the evening. The father attended some of the children\u2019s activities and he recalls accompanying the mother to a few medical appointments.\n[17] The mother coordinated all of the children\u2019s activities and appointments with the family doctor, optometrist and dentist. She was the primary parent with whom the school communicated concerning the children. When one of the children had to leave school early because of behavioural problems, the school communicated primarily with the mother, who then went to pick the child up or asked her mother to do it. After school, the children returned to their mother\u2019s, where their father picked them up between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. for his overnight, even on Mondays. When the children were at home after school, the mother made them snacks and made sure they did their homework before leaving for their father\u2019s.\n[18] In light of these facts, even if it were admitted that every second Monday during school hours counted as time spent with the father, and the school may have been authorized to call either of the parents to let them know about concerns regarding the children, I conclude that the mother was primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of the children during each school day.\n[19] For these reasons, the appeal is allowed with costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 18th day of April 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nBoyle J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 46\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2019-3661(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nPATRICIA L\u00c9VESQUE ST-CYR v.

Graham\u201d\nGraham J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 47\nDate: 20240419\nDocket: 2014-3959(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nMADISON PACIFIC PROPERTIES INC.\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nGraham J.\n[1] In my Judgment dated December 27, 2023, I dismissed the Appellant\u2019s appeal (the \u201cAppeal\u201d) with costs to the Respondent. I provided the parties with time to reach an agreement on costs, failing which the parties were to make written submissions regarding costs. The parties were unable to reach an agreement and have now made written submissions.\n[2] The Respondent is requesting lump sum costs of $408,833.77, being 35% of its actual legal costs. The Respondent is also seeking reimbursement of disbursements of $43,740.96.\n[3] The Appellant is requesting lump sum costs of $109,350, being double the Respondent\u2019s costs under the tariff. The Appellant accepts that the Respondent is entitled to all but $19,680 of the disbursements the Respondent has claimed.\n[4] Subsection 147(3) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) sets out the following factors that the Court may consider in awarding costs.\nResult of the Proceeding\n[5] The Respondent was totally successful in the Appeal. However, since it was an all-or-nothing appeal, the Respondent accepts that this factor should be neutral. I agree (2078970 Ontario Inc. v. The Queen, 2018 TCC 214).\nAmounts in Issue\n[6] There was $2,188,839 in federal tax in issue in the Appeal. The Appellant has two other tax years in issue that are currently sitting at CRA Appeals involving the same losses. In addition, there is a further $10 million in federal tax in dispute in a number of related appeals.[1]\n[7] The Respondent submits that the additional tax from these disputes should be taken into account as the outcome of the Appeal will have a significant impact on the related appeals. I agree. This factor argues for increased costs.\nImportance of the Issues\n[8] The Respondent submits that GAAR-related litigation is always important. I agree that that is generally the case. However, the Appeal proceeded in the shadow of Deans Knight Income Corporation. The Tax Court decision in Deans Knight (2019 TCC 76) was issued before the trial in the Appeal began. The Federal Court of Appeal decision (2021 FCA 160) was issued between the first half of the trial and the second half. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted during the second half of the trial. I reserved my decision until after the Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision (2023 SCC 16) and allowed the parties to make additional submissions.\n[9] There is no question that Deans Knight was a significant case that dealt with important issues. However, in my view, the same cannot be said of the Appeal. The Appeal involved, by and large, the application of the law in Deans Knight to a different set of facts.\n[10] While the Appeal was the first loss-trading decision from this Court after Deans Knight, it was preceded by the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in MMV Capital Partners Inc. v. The King (2023 FCA 234) and was quickly followed by Justice Pizzitelli\u2019s decision in Total Entergy Services Inc. v. The King (2024 TCC 12).\n[11] The Respondent submits that my interlocutory ruling on the admissibility of a letter from the Canada Revenue Agency to the Department of Finance was an important evidentiary point. I accept that that ruling advanced the law, but the ruling involved little more than a couple of hours of trial time and is not, in itself, a reason to award higher costs.\n[12] The Respondent also submits that the \u201cgroup of persons\u201d issue advanced the law. While that may be the case, again, I do not see this as justifying higher costs.\n[13] Based on all of the foregoing, I do not think that the Appeal was of particular importance to the development of tax law, to the public\u2019s interest or to a broad number of people. At the same time, it cannot be said that the Appeal was purely a private matter involving a routine application of the law and of no interest to anyone other than the parties. Accordingly, I find that this factor is neutral.\nComplexity of the Issues\n[14] GAAR appeals are, by their nature, legally complex. The Appeal also had significant factual complexity. While the legal issues were less important because of Deans Knight, the fact that the law was constantly changing as that appeal worked its way to the Supreme Court of Canada meant that the parties regularly had to re-work their arguments and submissions.\n[15] Based on all of the foregoing, I find that the complexity of the issues argues for higher costs.\nVolume of Work\n[16] The volume of work involved in the Appeal was significant both in terms of documents, preparation and trial time. That said, I will treat this factor as neutral. The fees charged already reflect that volume and, since I intend to award the Respondent a percentage of those fees, awarding a higher percentage because of the volume would result in double counting.\n[17] The Appellant submits that the Respondent used more counsel at trial than the Appellant (four as opposed to three). I do not think that four counsel was inappropriate for the volume of work involved.\n[18] The Appellant also argues that various counsel for the Respondent changed a number of times over the course of the litigation which resulted in unnecessary duplication as new counsel was brought up to speed. It is not surprising that there would have been a number of changes of counsel on the Respondent\u2019s side given that the Appeal took place over almost 10 years. I do not find these changes sufficiently significant to affect costs.\n[19] I also note in passing that the Respondent\u2019s legal costs are calculated using rates so remarkably out of line with the rates that law firms charge for lawyers of comparable experience and skill that the Appellant has already effectively received a massive discount.\nDenial or Refusal to Admit\n[20] The Respondent points to a number of facts that the Appellant refused to admit and says that this factor argues for higher costs. I find this factor to be a significant factor but for different reasons.\n[21] A great deal of trial time was spent hearing evidence about the purpose of the series of transactions. The Appellant maintained that the series was undertaken primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain a tax benefit. It was only during oral argument that the Appellant conceded that the sole purpose of the creation and use of the Class C non-voting shares was to preserve the losses.\n[22] I recognize that parties do not know in advance how witnesses will perform on the stand or what weight the judge will give to their evidence. However, where the weakness of the evidence in support of an argument are as apparent as they were in this case,[2] it is appropriate to deal with the pursuit of that argument through costs. Significant trial time (in particular, significant time spent preparing for and conducting cross-examinations) could have been saved had the Appellant conceded this issue up front.\n[23] The Appellant points to some issues that the Respondent should have conceded earlier in the process and to the resulting costs that the Appellant was forced to incur preparing for trial. These arguments have merit but do not outweigh the foregoing.\n[24] Based on the foregoing, I find that this factor argues for significantly higher costs.\nConduct Affecting the Duration of the Proceeding\n[25] I find this factor to be neutral. The Appellant points to a witness that counsel for the Respondent had indicated the Respondent would be calling but who the Respondent ultimately decided not to call and argues that the Appellant wasted time preparing to cross-examine that witness.\n[26] I was not surprised by the Respondent\u2019s decision not to call the witness. The Appellant\u2019s witnesses were so clearly lacking in credibility that the Respondent did not need evidence to counter their assertions. If anything, the Respondent\u2019s decision led to a shorter trial.\nImproper, Vexatious or Unnecessary Stages\n[27] There was no evidence that would suggest that any stage in the Appeal was improper, vexatious or unnecessary.\nStages Taken Through Negligence, Mistake or Excessive Caution\n[28] There was no evidence that would suggest that any stage in the Appeal was taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution.\nSettlement Offers\n[29] This factor is not applicable.\nOther Relevant Matters\n[30] The Respondent has not sought costs for counsel\u2019s travel time, the Appellant\u2019s motion to compel or work related to the Appellant\u2019s interlocutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal.\nAnalysis\n[31] As set out above, the Respondent is requesting lump sum costs of $408,833.77, being 35% of its actual legal costs of $1,168,096. This 35% figure is in line with costs awarded in similar appeals.[3]\n[32] I awarded that same percentage in Bank of Montreal v. The Queen (2021 TCC 3). In that appeal, I did not have the same concerns that I have here regarding the Appellant\u2019s refusal to concede a losing issue. Because of that factor, I would have been inclined to award costs closer to 40% had the Respondent requested them.\n[33] Based on all of the foregoing, I find the Respondent\u2019s requested costs to be appropriate.\n[34] The Respondent also seeks disbursements of $43,740,96. The largest disbursement is the $19,680 that the Respondent incurred consulting with an expert that the Respondent anticipated using as an expert witness. That is the only disbursement that the Appellant disputes. The Appellant asserts that the expert was unnecessary.\n[35] I am satisfied that given the way that the case progressed and, in particular, the tax purpose issue described above, it was appropriate for the Respondent to retain the expert at the time that the expert was retained. I therefore find that this was an appropriate disbursement.\nConclusion\n[36] Based on all of the foregoing, fixed costs of $408,833.77 and disbursements of $43,740,96 are awarded to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 19th day of April 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

It is, at its heart, a re-litigation of the same issues that were dealt with by this Court and by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. The Queen.[1] The result is the same, but for different reasons.\nI. Overview [2] In the periods in question, Aimia Canada Inc. (\u201cAeroplan\u201d) operated the Aeroplan loyalty reward program. The program offered active members the ability to accumulate points called Aeroplan Miles by purchasing products and services from Aeroplan\u2019s accumulation partners. Those partners included various credit card brands, grocery stores, airlines and retailers.\n[3] The Aeroplan Miles could be redeemed by members through Aeroplan, subject to certain terms and conditions.\n[4] The Toronto-Dominion Bank (\u201cTD\u201d) entered into an Affinity Program Agreement with Aeroplan (the \u201cAgreement\u201d).[2] The Agreement allowed TD to add the Aeroplan Miles reward feature to certain of its TD Visa cards.\n[5] Aeroplan invoiced TD for various amounts under the Agreement. Aeroplan applied GST\/HST to those invoices. TD paid the invoices. Later, TD decided that it had paid the GST\/HST in error and applied for rebates.\n[6] Adjusting for certain concessions made by TD, the total rebate in issue for the reporting periods ended between January 1, 2014 and October 31, 2016 is $141,060,608.\n[7] In order to determine whether TD is entitled to the rebates that it is requesting, I will first have to first determine what Aeroplan supplied to TD under the Agreement and then determine how that supply should be taxed.\n[8] TD takes the position that Aeroplan supplied it with Aeroplan Miles and that Aeroplan Miles are \u201cgift certificates\u201d. Since section 181.2 of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) deems there not to have been a supply when a gift certificate is sold, TD says that Aeroplan should not have charged GST.\n[9] The Respondent takes the position that Aeroplan made a taxable supply of marketing services. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that Aeroplan Miles are not gift certificates.\nII. Issues [10] There are two main issues in this appeal:\n(a)Was the predominant element of the supply that Aeroplan made to TD promotional and marketing services or the right to allocate Aeroplan Miles to its cardholders?\n(b)If the predominant element was the right to allocate Aeroplan Miles, is an Aeroplan Mile a \u201cgift certificate\u201d within the meaning of section 181.2?\n[11] There is also an ancillary issue regarding a series of payments that TD made to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (\u201cCIBC\u201d).\nIII. Test to Be Applied When More Than One Good or Service Supplied [12] Aeroplan did not just supply one good or service to TD. Under the Agreement, Aeroplan supplied a number of different goods and services.\n[13] In River Cree Resort Limited Partnership v. The Queen, I set out the tests that the case law has established should be used when determining the nature of a supply consisting of more than one element:[3]\n1)What was provided: Determine what goods and\/or services the supplier provided for the consideration received (O.A. Brown Ltd. v. The Queen; Global Cash Access (Canada) Inc. v. The Queen; Great\u2011West Life Assurance Co. v. The Queen; SLFI Group v. The Queen; CIBC v. The Queen).\n2)Single compound supply or multiple supply: Determine whether the goods and\/or services provided should be characterized as \u201ca single supply comprised of a number of constituent elements or multiple supplies of separate goods and\/or services\u201d (O.A. Brown Ltd.; Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association v. The Queen; City of Calgary v. The Queen; SLFI Group; Global Cash Access; CIBC v. The Queen).\n3)Determine how the resulting supply should be treated: Determine whether that supply was or those supplies were taxable supplies or exempt supplies:\n(a)Single Compound Supply: For a single compound supply, determine what the predominant element of the supply was. This analysis should focus on the purchaser\u2019s perspective of the supply. The supply will be taxed in the same manner as that predominant element (Global Cash Access; Great-West Life; SLFI Group).\n(b)Multiple Supply: For multiple supplies, determine whether each of those individual supplies was a taxable supply or an exempt supply.\nIf one of the multiple supplies was, itself, a single compound supply, apply the test in paragraph (a) to that supply (Jema International Travel Clinic Inc. v. The Queen).\nIf there was a single consideration paid for the multiple supplies, consider whether sections 138 (incidental supplies) or 139 (financial services in mixed supply) apply to nonetheless deem there to have been a single compound supply (Camp Mini-Yo-We Inc. v. The Queen; 9056-2059 Qu\u00e9bec v. The Queen; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. The Queen; Maritime Life Assurance Co. v. The Queen; Jema International; CIBC v. The Queen).\n[14] I will apply those tests to the supply that Aeroplan made to TD.\nIV. What Was Provided? [15] The first step is to determine what goods and\/or services were provided for the consideration received. I will first describe which goods and services were provided and then discuss which ones were not.\nA. Elements of the Supply [16] The following goods and services were supplied under the Agreement.\nAeroplan Miles [17] Customers who used TD\u2019s Aeroplan cards earned Aeroplan Miles for purchases that they made on their cards. The number of Aeroplan Miles that they earned depended on which card they had.\n[18] TD established four types of Aeroplan co-branded cards: an entry-level card, a premium card, a high net-worth card and a business card. The cards had different annual fees. Cards with higher annual fees offered a higher number of Aeroplan Miles for each dollar spent.\n[19] In order to fulfil its obligation to its customers to provide them with these Aeroplan Miles, TD had to cause Aeroplan to issue Aeroplan Miles to those customers. Every month, TD would tell Aeroplan how many Aeroplan Miles each of its customers had earned. Aeroplan would then deposit those Aeroplan Miles into those customers\u2019 Aeroplan accounts.\n[20] TD did not actually acquire the Aeroplan Miles. It acquired the right to cause Aeroplan to issue Aeroplan Miles. For the purposes of the issues before me, it makes no difference whether Aeroplan supplied TD with Aeroplan Miles or the right to cause Aeroplan to issue Aeroplan Miles. Therefore, for simplicity, in the rest of these Reasons for Judgment, I will refer to TD as having purchased Aeroplan Miles.\nWelcome Bonuses [21] New TD Aeroplan cardholders received welcome bonuses of additional Aeroplan Miles. If the new cardholder was an existing TD customer, then Aeroplan supplied these welcome Aeroplan Miles at no cost to TD. If the new cardholder was not an existing TD customer, then TD purchased the welcome Aeroplan Miles from Aeroplan. There were also situations where Aeroplan and TD would share the cost.\nBonus Miles [22] Aeroplan offered cardholders bonus Aeroplan Miles if they purchased certain goods or services. The bonus Aeroplan Miles available for purchases with Air Canada were particularly appealing to cardholders.[4] TD and Aeroplan agreed that TD, Aeroplan and Air Canada would each provide a certain portion of these bonus Aeroplan Miles. Aeroplan supplied TD with the Aeroplan Miles that TD needed to provide.\nExclusive Issuer [23] Prior to TD\u2019s involvement with Aeroplan, Aeroplan had an agreement with CIBC under which CIBC issued co-branded Aeroplan Visa credit cards. When the CIBC agreement came to an end, Aeroplan looked for a new credit card provider to partner with.\n[24] Under the Agreement, TD obtained the exclusive right to issue Aeroplan Visa cards. The only exception to this exclusivity was that CIBC would continue to be able to issue Aeroplan Visa cards to its banking customers if those customers asked for such a card in a CIBC branch.\n[25] The flip side of this exclusivity was that TD was not allowed to be involved in any other rewards programs with the exception of its pre-existing in-house program.\nMost Favoured Nation [26] TD obtained what it called \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d status. This meant that ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||| This was important as |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\nMarketing [27] TD and Aeroplan agreed that they would each commit a specific amount of money to marketing each year. TD\u2019s share would be used to promote the co\u2011branded credit cards. Aeroplan\u2019s share would be used to promote both the Aeroplan program and the co-branded cards. Aeroplan\u2019s marketing included marketing aimed at its existing members who did not have Aeroplan credit cards.\n[28] The Agreement placed certain restrictions on both parties\u2019 marketing. TD was not allowed to market the co-branded credit cards alongside its other credit cards and had limits on the amount of money that it could spend promoting its in-house reward points program. Aeroplan was not allowed to market towards CIBC customers and had restrictions on how it could market Amex Aeroplan cards.\nLicence to Use Trademarks [29] Aeroplan granted TD a royalty-free licence to use the Aeroplan trademark on its cards and in its advertising. TD granted Aeroplan a similar licence for the use of its trademarks in Aeroplan\u2019s advertising.\nPreferred Card Status [30] Aeroplan was required to position TD\u2019s Aeroplan cards as Aeroplan\u2019s preferred cards.\nAvoiding Expiration of Aeroplan Miles [31] In the periods in question, Aeroplan Miles expired if an Aeroplan member did not either accumulate new Aeroplan Miles or redeem existing Aeroplan Miles in a 12-month period. Knowing that its cardholders would be upset if their Aeroplan Miles expired before they had the chance to use them, TD had Aeroplan agree that TD would automatically purchase one Aeroplan Mile for any TD cardholder whose Aeroplan Miles would otherwise expire.\nMember Enrollment and Account Management [32] Aeroplan agreed to enroll TD cardholders who were not Aeroplan members in the Aeroplan program and to administer those members\u2019 Aeroplan accounts, including dealing with any member disputes.\nCooperation [33] TD and Aeroplan agreed to form a Joint Marketing Committee and a Joint Steering Committee.\n[34] The Joint Marketing Committee coordinated the promotion of the program. The purpose of this committee was to review what each party was doing in terms of marketing to avoid, for example, duplicating the same message in the same medium at the same time.\n[35] The Joint Steering Committee coordinated the operation of the program. The committee looked at the full business relationship between the parties, not just the marketing aspects. The committee reviewed an overall business plan each year. Through the committee, Aeroplan told TD how its customers (as a whole) were using their points. The parties also used this committee to try to resolve any disputes.\nData Analytics and Sharing [36] Aeroplan provided TD with data analytics to help TD increase credit card spending and better target its marketing. TD and Aeroplan also shared certain customer data through a third party anonymization process.\nAeroplan 2.0 [37] Aeroplan agreed to upgrade its program to make it more appealing to members. TD referred to the upgraded program as \u201cAeroplan 2.0\u201d.\n[38] Prior to Aeroplan 2.0, an Aeroplan member who wanted to redeem their Aeroplan Miles for a flight would determine the number of Aeroplan Miles that they would have to spend by consulting a redemption chart. The chart set out the number of Aeroplan Miles needed for short-haul, long-haul and international flights in both economy and business class. Only a certain number of seats were available for redemption on any given flight. This meant that an Aeroplan member might not be able to purchase a flight in busy seasons or when travelling to popular destinations. This could be a considerable irritant to Aeroplan members.\n[39] Aeroplan 2.0 introduced the idea of market fare redemptions. This type of redemption allowed an Aeroplan member to redeem Aeroplan Miles for a flight based on the market price of the flight. Market fare redemptions were available for any seat on any Air Canada flight. This improvement to the Aeroplan program ensured that members could purchase the flight that they wanted so long as they were willing to redeem more Aeroplan Miles to do so. TD saw this as a significant improvement to the program that would remove a major customer irritant.\n[40] Aeroplan 2.0 also involved the creation of a number of tiers of Aeroplan membership, with additional benefits for members at higher tiers.\nB. Elements That Were Not Part of the Supply [41] There were certain supplies made under the Agreement or in different agreements that were not part of the supply.\nCredit Card Operations [42] Under the Agreement, TD maintained full responsibility for its actual credit card operations. This was not a service that Aeroplan provided.\nAir Canada Benefits [43] Aeroplan provided TD with certain Air Canada benefits that it could offer to its customers, such as lounge access, complementary checked baggage and priority boarding. The parties agree that those were separate taxable supplies.\nAcquisition of CIBC Cardholders [44] When TD took over from CIBC as the exclusive provider of Aeroplan Visas, something had to be done with CIBC\u2019s existing Aeroplan Visa cardholders. TD, CIBC and Aeroplan agreed that those cardholders would be divided into two groups. Cardholders who had other banking relationships with CIBC would be allowed to continue to use their CIBC Aeroplan Visa cards. Cardholders who did not have other banking relationships with CIBC would be transitioned to TD Aeroplan Visa cards.\n[45] The cardholders that TD acquired from CIBC significantly increased TD\u2019s annual volume of credit card transactions. Acquiring these cardholders was undoubtedly a huge part of what made the overall deal attractive to TD. It could even have been the most attractive part of the overall deal for TD. However, acquiring these cardholders was not an element of the supply that Aeroplan made to TD. TD acquired the cardholders from CIBC, not Aeroplan. It paid CIBC for their accounts, not Aeroplan.\nV. Single Compound Supply or Multiple Supply [46] Having established what goods and services Aeroplan supplied, I now turn to the second step, which is to determine whether those goods and services should be characterized as a single compound supply or as multiple supplies of separate goods and services.\nA. General\n[47] Subject to the issue described below regarding Aeroplan 2.0, the parties agree that the goods and services supplied were part of a single compound supply. I agree.\nB. Aeroplan 2.0 Payment [48] Under the Agreement, TD paid Aeroplan a significant amount of money up front for what the Agreement describes as a \u201ccompensation for expenditures to be incurred by Aeroplan\u201d to move to the Aeroplan 2.0 program (the \u201cAeroplan 2.0 Payment\u201d).[5] Aeroplan charged GST on this payment. The rebate that TD has claimed includes that GST.\n[49] TD takes the position that the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment was part of the consideration for the single compound supply. The Respondent disagrees. The Respondent also raised two preliminary objections in respect of this issue. TD has raised one of its own.\nSpecified Person Objection [50] First, the Respondent argues that TD did not properly identify the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment in its notice of objection and is therefore precluded by the specified person rule in section 306.1 from raising it in its appeal. I disagree.\n[51] TD is a specified person. Subsection 306.1(1) states that a specified person may only raise issues and seek relief in this Court if the person has complied with subsection 301(1.2).\n[52] Subsection 301(1.2) requires a notice of objection filed by a specified person to reasonably describe each issue to be decided, to specify the relief sought in respect of each issue and to provide the facts and reasons relied upon for each issue.\n[53] While subsection 301(1.2) requires a specified person to set out the facts and reasons in respect of each issue, so long as the specified person raises the issue in their notice of objection, they are not precluded from adding new facts or reasons in support of that issue (British Columbia Transit v. The Queen).[6]\n[54] In its notice of objection, TD raised the issue of its entitlement to a rebate in respect of amounts paid to Aeroplan in error. The relief sought in respect of that issue included a rebate of the GST that TD had paid on the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment. While TD did not specifically identify the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment or explain why it viewed the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment to be part of a single compound supply under the Agreement, I consider those to be facts and reasons supporting the issue that it raised, not new issues. Accordingly, I find that TD is not precluded from arguing that the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment was part of the single compound supply.\nPleadings [55] In the alternative, the Respondent argues that TD did not properly identify this issue in its pleadings or plead the material facts and reasons with respect to this issue and was therefore precluded from arguing it at trial. Again, I disagree.\n[56] While TD should have pled this issue more clearly and the Respondent may not have been fully aware of this issue at the outset, the Respondent became aware of it and, in fact, addressed it in the Amended Reply and dealt with it on discovery.\nRespondent Has Not Conceded the Issue [57] TD argues that the Respondent agreed in paragraph 26 of the Amended Reply that the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment was part of the single compound supply. I disagree.\n[58] It is clear to me that paragraph 26, read in the context of paragraph 32 of the Amended Reply, was not referring to the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment. The Respondent specifically identifies the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment in a number of places and argues that that payment did not involve the supply of Aeroplan Miles. I take this to mean that the Respondent did not consider it to be part of the single compound supply.\n[59] In addition, I do not interpret the read-in provided by TD from its examination for discovery of the Respondent\u2019s representative to amount to a concession.\nMerits [60] Having dealt with the preliminary objections, I can now consider whether the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment was in respect of a separate supply of an upgraded Aeroplan 2.0 program or was part of the single compound supply. I find that it was part of the single compound supply.\n[61] TD\u2019s desire to have the Aeroplan program upgraded to Aeroplan 2.0 was inextricably linked to its desire to participate in the program. TD was concerned about the flexibility of the Avion program offered by the Royal Bank of Canada and wanted to be able to compete with that program. Aeroplan 2.0 would make it easier for cardholders to use their Aeroplan Miles and would reward cardholders who spent more money.\n[62] Had the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment been made several years into TD\u2019s involvement in the program, I may have viewed it differently. However, as it was an up\u2011front payment that was a part of the Agreement, I have difficulty conceiving of it as anything other than part of the single supply. TD did not just want to buy Aeroplan Miles, it wanted to buy more valuable Aeroplan Miles. Aeroplan 2.0 allowed that to happen.\n[63] Having determined that Aeroplan made a single compound supply that included the Aeroplan 2.0 Payment, I can now move on to determining the predominant element of that supply.\nVI. Predominant Element [64] For years, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that, where there is a single compound supply composed of a number of elements, one must determine what the predominant element of the supply was. The supply will then be taxed in the same manner as that predominant element. This test has been described as determining the \u201ccommercial efficacy\u201d of the arrangement (Global Cash Access (Canada) Inc. v. The Queen;[7] SLFI Group v. The Queen;[8] Great-West Life Assurance Co. v. The Queen[9]).\n[65] However, the recent decision in CIBC (FCA) has cast doubt on this test.\n[66] I will first apply the test set out in Global Cash Access, SLFI and Great\u2011West Life. I will then consider whether CIBC (FCA) affects my conclusion.\nA. The Traditional Test [67] The Respondent says that the predominant element was the supply of promotional and marketing services. TD says that the predominant element of the single compound supply made under the Agreement was the supply of Aeroplan Miles. I agree with TD.\nNo Commercial Efficacy Without Aeroplan Miles [68] TD wanted to grow its credit card business. To do that, it needed to acquire new customers and retain existing customers. TD was particularly interested in having customers who spent large amounts on their credit cards and paid their balances when due. It believed that customers who were frequent fliers with Air Canada would be likely to fit their desired profile. It knew that those types of customers were interested in accumulating Aeroplan Miles. Therefore, to attract those customers, TD wanted to be able to offer a credit card with Aeroplan Miles.\n[69] TD called Jason Rasmussen as a witness. In the reporting periods in question, Mr. Rasmussen was an Associate Vice President dealing with TD Aeroplan credit card relationships. I found Mr. Rasmussen to be credible.\n[70] Mr. Rasmussen testified that the primary thing that TD obtained under the Agreement was the ability to give Aeroplan Miles to its customers.\n[71] Mr. Rasmussen stated that there were approximately 3,000,000 Aeroplan members in 2013 and that approximately 1,200,000 of those members had Aeroplan-branded credit cards. TD wanted to be part of that business.\n[72] Mr. Rasmussen explained that customers love Aeroplan Miles and that a credit card that helped them to accumulate more Aeroplan Miles was very attractive to them. Aeroplan was a premier loyalty rewards program. It had access to the dominant airline in Canada. Its customer base consisted of premium customers who were very appealing to TD. They tended to have higher-than-normal incomes and higher-than-normal spending. Since TD earned income on each dollar spent on its credit cards, it valued higher-spending customers.\n[73] The Respondent called Michael Rhodes as a witness. In the reporting periods in question, Mr. Rhodes was the Executive Vice President, North American Credit Cards & Merchant Services at TD. Mr. Rhodes was responsible for negotiating the Agreement with Aeroplan. I found him to be generally credible. Mr. Rhodes testified that he had been involved with credit card programs since the 1990s and that, in his experience, frequent flyer points are the premium product that a credit card provider can attach to its cards.\n[74] Mr. Rhodes testified that TD\u2019s primary objective in negotiating the Agreement was to get access to Aeroplan Miles. While he may have over\u2011emphasized this point in his testimony to the point of slipping into advocacy, I nonetheless accept that he viewed the ability to provide customers with Aeroplan Miles as the single most important element of TD\u2019s agreement with Aeroplan.\n[75] I acknowledge that the other elements of the supply had value. TD went to great lengths to include them in the Agreement. However, there would have been no point in obtaining marketing services from Aeroplan, exclusive rights to use the Aeroplan logo, and data analytics about existing and potential customers if TD could not provide those customers with Aeroplan Miles.\n[76] The method of calculating payments under the Agreement strongly supports the idea that the predominant element of the supply was Aeroplan Miles. The amount that TD paid Aeroplan every month under the Agreement was calculated based on the number of Aeroplan Miles that Aeroplan credited to TD cardholders in the month. There was a set price per Aeroplan Mile. The price did not vary with the amount of marketing or data analytics provided by Aeroplan.\n[77] TD\u2019s most favoured nation status ensured that |||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||. If TD had been paying for marketing, given the restrictions that the Agreement imposed on Aeroplan\u2019s ability to market in respect of |||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||, I would have expected TD to be paying far more ||| ||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||.\n[78] In summary, there would have been no commercial efficacy to the Agreement if TD could not provide Aeroplan Miles to its cardholders. Whether those Aeroplan Miles came from credit card spending, bonus miles or welcome bonuses, the fact was that TD\u2019s cardholders wanted them. Offering a credit card under the Aeroplan brand that did not actually provide Aeroplan Miles would have misled, annoyed and ultimately alienated those cardholders.\nPromotional and Marketing Services Were Not the Predominant Element [79] The Respondent submits that marketing and promotional services were the predominant element of the supply. I disagree.\n[80] Mr. Rasmussen testified that TD did not pay Aeroplan anything for the marketing that Aeroplan did. There is nothing in the Agreement or the invoices that would suggest otherwise. The money that each side was required to spend on marketing was something that they contributed to further their joint business interests.\n[81] TD marketed TD Aeroplan cards. That benefited TD by attracting more cardholders. However, it also benefited Aeroplan. Aeroplan makes money selling Aeroplan Miles. The more people use Aeroplan-branded credit cards, the more Aeroplan Miles Aeroplan sells.\n[82] In some of its advertising, Aeroplan marketed the Aeroplan program. That clearly benefited Aeroplan but it also benefited TD by increasing awareness of the benefits of earning Aeroplan Miles. In other types of advertising, Aeroplan marketed TD Aeroplan cards alongside the Aeroplan program. Again, this benefited both parties.\n[83] At no point did Aeroplan do any marketing that was exclusively for TD\u2019s benefit. It did not, for example, market TD\u2019s banking, lending or investing services.\n[84] The Agreement specified how much each side was to spend each year. TD was required to spend |||||||||||||| |||||||||||||| what Aeroplan had to spend in the first year of the Agreement. Thereafter, |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||. This sharing of marketing costs is completely inconsistent with the idea that Aeroplan was providing marketing services to TD.\n[85] The amount that TD paid Aeroplan each month bore no relation to the amount that Aeroplan spent on marketing each year. In fact, the typical amount that Mr. Rasmussen testified TD spent on Aeroplan Miles each month was || |||| |||||| |||| the amount that the Agreement required Aeroplan to spend on marketing for the entire year. This clearly indicates that TD was paying for something other than marketing.[10]\n[86] Mr. Rasmussen testified that, in his view, Aeroplan\u2019s marketing was not that effective as very few cardholders came in through Aeroplan. On cross\u2011examination, it became clear that Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s conclusion was based on the faulty assumption that the 65% to 70% of cardholders who opened an account at a TD branch had come to the branch because of TD\u2019s marketing. As a result, I give no weight to Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s views of the effectiveness of Aeroplan\u2019s marketing.\n[87] Mr. Rasmussen also testified that the data analytics and sharing aspects of the Agreement had little value. His impressions of the value of these elements comes from his experiences with their value after the fact. He testified that he did not recall TD ever using the anonymized third party data. He explained that, since most cardholders came through TD\u2019s own channels, TD already had the information about them that it needed.\n[88] That said, Mr. Rasmussen was not directly involved in the negotiation of the Agreement so he does not know what value TD placed on the data analytics and sharing during negotiations. Whether it ultimately used the data or not, I find that TD must have attached some value to it or it would not have been included in the Agreement. However, that value was clearly insignificant compared to the value that TD placed on obtaining Aeroplan Miles for its cardholders.\nThe Reason for Acquiring a Good Does Not Change the Nature of the Good [89] The Respondent knows the relative amounts that TD and Aeroplan were required to spend on marketing under the Agreement. The Respondent also knows that TD paid Aeroplan sums so far in excess of Aeroplan\u2019s actual marketing expenditures that the payments must have been for something else. Finally, the Respondent knows that it would be pointless to market a TD Aeroplan card if TD could not provide its customers with actual Aeroplan Miles. So why is the Respondent arguing that the predominant element of the supply was marketing services?\n[90] While the Respondent does not expressly say so, what the Respondent is really doing is acknowledging that the predominant element was the purchase of Aeroplan Miles but asking me to re-characterize that purchase as a purchase of marketing services. That is not how the predominant element test works.\n[91] It is a predominant element test, not a predominant purpose test. The test requires me to consider which of the actual elements of the supply was the predominant one and to tax the entire supply based on that predominant element. It does not require me to re-characterize the actual elements of the supply into something different based on the purpose for which they were acquired.\n[92] Doing so would be a complete departure from the Act. Generally speaking, when dealing with taxable supplies, the Act imposes GST on what a person buys, not why they buy it. The purpose for buying a good or service is generally only relevant when considering whether there was an exempt supply, whether the person can claim an input tax credit or whether the person is entitled to certain rebates, such as the new housing rebate.\n[93] There is no question that TD bought the Aeroplan Miles for marketing purposes. But that does not change the fact that what it bought was Aeroplan Miles. That is what it should be taxed on.\n[94] Justice Stratas addressed this same argument in CIBC (FCA), albeit in dissent. I agree with and adopt his reasoning.[11]\nExclusivity Was Worthless Without Aeroplan Miles [95] Clearly, the exclusivity that Aeroplan provided to TD had significant value. It meant that TD did not have to compete with other financial institutions that offered Visa cards. It gave TD a premier market position. However, exclusivity would have been worthless without actual Aeroplan Miles. It was not enough for TD to be able to prevent other financial institutions from offering Aeroplan Visa cards. To succeed, TD needed to be able to give its customers Aeroplan Miles.\nOther Elements Were Not Predominant [96] The remaining elements of the supply simply supported the predominant element. Member enrollment and account management were incidental to the operation of the program. The joint committees benefited both parties and were simply a way of ensuring that they met their joint business goals. Exclusivity simply ensured that competitors could not offer the same Aeroplan Miles that TD was offering. Finally, the Aeroplan 2.0 program was simply a means of ensuring that TD was buying more valuable Aeroplan Miles.\nOther Witnesses [97] Before moving on, I need to quickly comment on three other witnesses whom the Respondent called: Riaz Ahmed, Matthew Hall and Edmund Clark.\n[98] In the reporting periods in question, Mr. Ahmed was the Group Head \u2013 Insurance, Credit Cards and Enterprise Strategy at TD. I found Mr. Ahmed to be credible. The reason that I do not refer to his testimony elsewhere is not that I did not accept it, but rather that I found that it did not add much to the overall evidence.\n[99] In the reporting periods in question, Mr. Hall was the General Manager, TD and MBNA Partnerships at Aeroplan. He was Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s principal contact at Aeroplan. While I initially found Mr. Hall to be generally credible in his direct evidence, he became so evasive on cross\u2011examination in his attempts to pretend that Aeroplan was not in the business of selling Aeroplan Miles that I am left with no choice but to disregard his entire testimony. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in these Reasons for Judgment, I have not relied on anything that he said.\n[100] In the reporting periods in question, Mr. Clark was the Group President and CEO of TD. I give no weight to any of Mr. Clark\u2019s testimony. He was evasive and non-responsive. He clearly had a point that he wanted to make about buying Aeroplan Miles and he just kept returning to it over and over.\nPreliminary Conclusion [101] On the basis of all of the foregoing, applying the test set out in Global Cash Access, SLFI and Great-West Life, I find that the predominant element of the single compound supply was the supply of Aeroplan Miles.\n[102] I will now consider whether CIBC (FCA) forces me to change this conclusion.\nB. The Test from CIBC (FCA) [103] CIBC involved very similar facts to the facts in this appeal. Pursuant to an agreement between Aeroplan and CIBC, CIBC issued Aeroplan\u2011branded credit cards to its customers. The agreement between Aeroplan and CIBC involved a single compound supply.\nTax Court Decision [104] At trial, Justice Visser found that there were a number of elements to the supply: providing all CIBC cardholders with Aeroplan membership, crediting Aeroplan Miles to such members and undertaking specified referral activities or services and marketing in respect of CIBC\u2019s cards.[12]\n[105] Justice Visser applied the test in Global Cash Access and Great-West Life and found that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the agreement between CIBC and Aeroplan was to market and promote applications for and increased use of participating CIBC credit cards.[13] He therefore concluded that the marketing and promotional services were the predominant element of the supply.[14] In reaching that conclusion, Justice Visser noted that the agreement between CIBC and Aeroplan \u201cexplicitly stipulates that the marketing and promotional services \u2026 are the predominant element\u201d of the supply.[15]\nFederal Court of Appeal \u2013 Majority Decision [106] On appeal, the majority upheld Justice Visser\u2019s decision. However, in doing so, the majority went much further than Justice Visser did.\n[107] While they acknowledged the law in Global Cash Access and Great-West Life, the majority specifically stated that it was not necessary to consider the predominant element of the agreement between CIBC and Aeroplan because the agreement explicitly identified the predominant supply and the supplies that were incidental thereto.[16]\n[108] The majority emphasized that there was nothing in the agreements to indicate that CIBC was purchasing Aeroplan Miles, nor was there any direct statement that the amounts paid by CIBC had been paid as consideration for Aeroplan Miles.[17] The majority explained that oral testimony could not override the explicit statements in the agreement between CIBC and Aeroplan.[18]\nFederal Court of Appeal - Dissent [109] Justice Stratas dissented. He stated that the majority had focused exclusively on the literal contractual language and that, in doing so, they had deviated from the test in Global Cash Access and Great-West Life, which encourages the court to get to the practical, commercial substance of the supply.[19]\n[110] Justice Stratas stated that he feared that the majority\u2019s reasoning would encourage parties to \u201cadd words not to change their contractual obligations or the practical, commercial substance of the supply but merely to trigger favourable GST treatment.\u201d[20]\n[111] Justice Stratas found that the predominant element of the supply between Aeroplan and CIBC was the right to allocate Aeroplan Miles. He stated that, \u201c[b]ut for the right to allocate Miles, there would have been no point in the parties performing their other obligations.\u201d[21] He went on to explain in detail why the \u201cmere fact that CIBC plans to use its property, the rights to allocate Miles, to make money does not support the view that we are dealing with promotional and marketing services.\u201d[22]\n[112] With respect, I prefer Justice Stratas\u2019 approach to that of the majority.\n[113] I share Justice Stratas\u2019 concern that the majority\u2019s decision will lead to taxpayers inserting self-serving statements into agreements declaring the predominant element of the agreement to be whatever the parties want it to be.\n[114] The majority referred to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Shell Canada Ltd. v. The Queen[23] as confirming that the bona fide legal relationships of taxpayers must be respected in tax cases.[24] That is clearly the law, but I do not think that Justice Stratas was suggesting that the bona fide legal relationships between CIBC and Aeroplan should be altered. He was not suggesting that the agreement be re-characterized as a lease, licence, loan or some other type of transaction in order to better represent its true economic substance. That would be contrary to Shell.\n[115] In fact, it does not appear to me that Justice Stratas was trying to re\u2011characterize the legal relationship at all. He was simply trying to establish (in accordance with Global Cash Access and Great-West Life) which of the many elements that CIBC was supplying was the predominant element. Looking for the predominant element of a supply, while still respecting the form of the supply, is very different from looking at economic substance over form.\nHow to Apply CIBC [116] Despite my support of Justice Stratas\u2019 dissent, I am bound by the decision of the majority. However, I am also bound by the prior decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in Global Cash Access, SLFI and Great-West Life, none of which were specifically rejected by the majority.\n[117] Thankfully, I do not have to choose which Federal Court of Appeal decision to follow. The majority in CIBC (FCA) relied on an explicit statement in the relevant agreement that set out the parties\u2019 view of the predominant element of the supply. The Agreement in the present case contains no such statement. Similarly, the majority relied on the fact that there was nothing in the CIBC agreements to indicate that CIBC was purchasing Aeroplan Miles. That is not the case in this appeal.\n[118] In the circumstances, since CIBC (FCA) can be distinguished on its facts, and since the majority did not reject the law as set out in Global Cash Access or Great-West Life, I will follow the approach laid out in those cases and used by Justice Stratas in his dissent.\nC. Conclusion [119] On the basis of all of the foregoing, I find that the predominant element of the single compound supply made by Aeroplan to TD was the supply of Aeroplan Miles.\n[120] The final step in the test is to determine how that supply should be treated. TD submits that the single compound supply of Aeroplan Miles was a supply of gift certificates under section 181.2 of the Act and was thus deemed not to have been a supply. The Respondent submits that the supply was a taxable supply of property. While the Respondent does not explicitly say so, the Respondent is essentially arguing that Aeroplan Miles are coupons.\nVII. What Is a Gift Certificate? [121] Section 181.2 deals with gift certificates. It states that:\nFor the purposes of this Part, the issuance or sale of a gift certificate for consideration shall be deemed not to be a supply and, when given as consideration for a supply of property or a service, the gift certificate shall be deemed to be money.\n[122] The term \u201cgift certificate\u201d is not defined in the Act. To understand what a gift certificate is, one has to first understand what a coupon is.\n[123] Subsection 181(1) states that \u201c\u2018coupon\u2019 includes a voucher, receipt, ticket or other device but does not include a gift certificate or a barter unit\u201d. This definition makes two things clear. First, coupons, gift certificates and barter units are all types of devices. Second, since subsection 181(1) specifically defines \u201ccoupon\u201d as not including a gift certificate or barter unit, any device that is not a gift certificate or a barter unit is, by definition, a coupon.\n[124] Section 181.3 contains enough other conditions that it is not difficult to determine what a barter unit is. Therefore, the key question is what distinguishes a gift certificate from the catch-all category of coupon.\n[125] In order to determine whether an Aeroplan Mile was a gift certificate, I need to answer four questions:\n(a)What is the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d?\n(b)Does the context or purpose of the Act change that ordinary meaning?\n(c)What characteristics does a gift certificate have?\n(d)Does an Aeroplan Mile have those characteristics?\n[126] The courts have dealt with gift certificates on four occasions CIBC (FCA), Canasia Industries Limited v. The Queen,[25] Royal Bank of Canada v. The Queen[26] and CIBC (TCC)). On each of those occasions, the courts have applied different, and sometimes conflicting, criteria.\nA. CIBC (FCA) [127] In CIBC (FCA), the majority declined to comment on the meaning of the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d.[27] However, Justice Stratas expressed his views in his dissent. While I am not bound by those views, TD submits that I should adopt them.\n[128] Justice Stratas held that the ordinary meaning of a gift certificate is \u201ca device, paper or electronic, that may be used, subject to its terms, as full or partial consideration for a supply offered by a supplier.\u201d[28] This description suggests that a gift certificate must have two key characteristics: it must be a device and it must be possible to use it as full or partial consideration for a supply.\n[129] I agree that both of those are characteristics of a gift certificate. However, a contextual analysis shows that this description is too broad to be helpful. A gift certificate must be something different from a coupon or a barter unit. The characteristics that Justice Stratas describes are also characteristics of both coupons and barter units.\n[130] Subsections 181(2) to (5) each describe a coupon being accepted \u201cin full or partial consideration\u201d for a supply. Similarly, subsection 181.3(1) defines a \u201cbarter unit\u201d as a credit that members of a barter exchange network have agreed to accept \u201cas full or partial consideration for supplies of property or services between members\u201d.\n[131] I acknowledge that section 181.3 contains enough other conditions that it is not difficult to distinguish a gift certificate from a barter unit. However, respectfully, any interpretation of \u201cgift certificate\u201d must encompass more characteristics than those proposed by Justice Stratas. It must, at a minimum, describe the key characteristics that differentiate a gift certificate from the default device\u2014a coupon.\nB. Canasia [132] In Canasia, Chief Justice Garon offered a more specific ordinary meaning of a gift certificate:[29]\n\u2026 a gift certificate is a very broad term for a voucher which entitles the bearer to redeem it according to its governing terms for goods or services or for a value towards the purchase of goods or services. \u2026[emphasis added]\n[133] However, a contextual analysis shows that even this more specific description of \u201cgift certificate\u201d is still too broad. Requiring that it be possible to redeem a gift certificate for goods or services or for a value towards the purchase of goods or services still does not distinguish gift certificates from coupons.\n[134] Subsections 181(4) and (5) use the same terms to describe coupons: \u201ca coupon that may be exchanged for the property or service or that entitles the recipient of the supply to a reduction of, or a discount on, the price of the property or service\u201d. Similarly, subsections 181(2) and (3) refer to \u201ca coupon that entitles the recipient of the supply to a reduction of the price of the property or service equal to a fixed dollar amount\u201d.\n[135] What Chief Justice Garon\u2019s description does do, however, is add the idea that a gift certificate can either be redeemed for certain goods or services or be redeemed for a value towards purchasing goods and services.\n[136] In making this important distinction, Chief Justice Garon recognized that there are two types of devices that are commonly called \u201cgift certificates\u201d and that those devices work differently:\n(a) Pre-Paid Card: One device can be used like money to purchase goods or services from the issuer or anyone else who accepts the device. A typical example would be a $100 gift card from a movie theatre chain that the bearer could use to pay for movies, popcorn, etc. For simplicity, I will call this device a \u201cPre-Paid Card\u201d.\n(b)Service or Good Voucher: The other device requires the issuer to provide the bearer a certain good or service free of charge. A typical example would be a voucher for a one-hour spa treatment. For simplicity, I will call this device a \u201cService or Good Voucher\u201d.\n[137] TD did not direct me to an ordinary meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d that would encompass anything other than these two devices. I cannot think of any such ordinary meaning.\nC. Royal Bank [138] In Royal Bank, Justice Hershfield adopted Chief Justice Garon\u2019s understanding of gift certificates, although he expressed some doubt as to whether a Service or Good Voucher was, in fact, a gift certificate.[30]\n[139] In expressing these doubts, Justice Hershfield referred to a voucher entitling the bearer to a free car wash. He thought that the bearer of such a voucher would expect that the GST had been pre-paid and that they would not have to pay GST when they presented the voucher for the car wash.\n[140] Despite his concerns, Justice Hershfield felt he should follow Canasia and thus accepted that Service or Good Vouchers could be gift certificates.[31]\n[141] I share Justice Hershfield\u2019s concerns. If I give my mother a voucher entitling her to a free pedicure at a local spa, I expect that whatever I paid for the voucher will cover the entire cost, including GST. The last thing I would want or expect is for my mother to have to pull out her wallet and pay GST on my gift.\n[142] If the voucher I have given my mother is a gift certificate, subsection 181.2 would deem there not to have been a supply when I bought it (meaning that I would have paid no GST) and would deem the device to be money when my mother presents it (meaning that she would pay the GST). By contrast, if the voucher is a coupon, I would have paid GST when I purchased it. When my mother redeems the voucher, subsection 181(4) would deem her to have acquired the pedicure for no consideration. As a result, she would not have to pay any GST.\nD. CIBC (TCC) [143] In CIBC (TCC), Justice Visser specifically addressed the question of whether Service or Good Vouchers were gift certificates. He held that the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d only captures a Pre-Paid Card, not a Service or Good Voucher.[32]\n[144] Justice Visser concluded that Parliament intended gift certificates to be equivalent to money and therefore that gift certificates should have attributes similar to those of money. Since Service or Good Vouchers do not have those attributes, he found that they are not gift certificates. I agree with Justice Visser. A contextual and purposive analysis supports his conclusion.\n[145] A Pre-Paid Card works harmoniously with section 181.2. Deeming a Pre-Paid Card to be money when it is used is consistent with the scheme of the Act. A Pre-Paid Card is nothing more than a repository of money. As Justice Visser observed, it is not that different from a deposit. In the same way that subsection 168(9) only requires GST to be paid on a deposit when it is applied as consideration for a supply, section 181.2 only requires GST to be paid on a gift certificate when it is given as consideration for a supply.[33]\n[146] By contrast, a Service or Good Voucher does not act as a repository of money. It acts as a repository of a service or good that has already been purchased but has yet to be delivered. As a result, treating it as a gift certificate and having section 181.2 deem it to be money results in the unexpected outcome described in the pedicure example above.\n[147] Treating a Service or Good Voucher as a coupon ensures that GST is paid when the purchase is made, not when the service or good is delivered. This is consistent with the general scheme of the Act. The general rule for collecting GST set out in subsection 168(1) requires GST to be paid when the consideration is paid or becomes due, not when the good or service is delivered.\nE. Conclusion [148] The ordinary meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d encompasses both Pre-Paid Cards and Service or Good Vouchers. However, the context and purpose of section 181.2 support the conclusion that Parliament only intended Pre-Paid Cards to be gift certificates. Accordingly, I find that only Pre-Paid Cards are gift certificates.\nVIII. Characteristics of a Gift Certificate [149] Having established the general types of devices that can and cannot be gift certificates, I will now attempt to further define the characteristics of a gift certificate and determine whether an Aeroplan Mile has those characteristics. However, before doing so, I need to emphasize two points.\n[150] First, although TD purchased hundreds of millions of Aeroplan Miles from Aeroplan, for TD to receive the rebates that it is seeking, it must show that each individual Aeroplan Mile that it purchased was a gift certificate. As a result, when determining whether the following characteristics were present, I will consider whether a single Aeroplan Mile had the necessary characteristics.\n[151] Second, I am not trying to decide whether an Aeroplan Mile is more like a coupon or a gift certificate. By definition, a device that is not a gift certificate or a barter unit is a coupon. This is the case whether or not it has characteristics that one would normally associate with the term \u201ccoupon\u201d. As no one is suggesting that an Aeroplan Mile meets the many conditions under section 181.3 to be a barter unit, my task is to determine whether an Aeroplan Mile is a gift certificate. If it is not, then it is, by default, a coupon.\nA. Core Characteristic [152] In CIBC (TCC), Justice Visser found that, at its core, a gift certificate is a storage mechanism for money and must therefore have attributes similar to those of money.[34] Similarly, Justice Stratas concluded that gift certificates have \u201cvery much the same quality as money\u201d.[35] I agree. This overarching characteristic informs my analysis of all of the other characteristics of a gift certificate.\n[153] The following list is not exhaustive.\nB. Stated Monetary Value Characteristic [154] I find that, for a device to be a gift certificate, it must state its monetary value.\n[155] The case law uses three different terms to describe this characteristic. It is variously described as a \u201cstated value\u201d, a \u201cstated monetary value\u201d or a \u201cfixed dollar value\u201d. I will adopt the term used by Justice Visser: \u201cstated monetary value\u201d.\n[156] Whatever this characteristic is called, there is considerable disagreement in the case law about whether a device has to have it to be a gift certificate. This disagreement stems from the debate over whether a Service or Good Voucher is a gift certificate.\n[157] Service or Good Vouchers state the service or good for which they can be redeemed rather than the monetary value of that good or service. Therefore, if one concludes that a Service or Good Voucher is a gift certificate, then one has no choice but to conclude that those types of gift certificates do not have to have a stated monetary value.\n[158] Canasia dealt with a Service or Good Voucher. The device in question entitled the bearer to a free flight (i.e. a specific service). Therefore, when Chief Justice Garon concluded that there was no requirement that the device have a stated monetary value, he was simply stating that Service or Good Vouchers need not have a stated monetary value. He was by no means concluding that Pre-Paid Cards do not need a stated monetary value.\n[159] On the contrary, Chief Justice Garon specifically referred to certain devices (i.e. Service or Good Vouchers) as entitling the bearer to a good or service and other devices (i.e. Pre-Paid Cards) as entitling the bearer to a \u201cstated value\u201d:[36]\nWhat is essential is that the bearer of the certificate who could be anyone to whom the certificate was transferred by the original purchaser of the certificate or by a subsequent bearer, is entitled to receive free of charge from the issuer of the certificate either a product or a service or the stated value towards a product or service. \u2026\n[emphasis added]\n[160] It is clear from this passage that Chief Justice Garon concluded that a Pre-Paid Card would need to have a stated monetary value.\n[161] In Royal Bank, Justice Hershfield reviewed the paragraph quoted above and concluded that Canasia stood for the proposition that a \u201cgift certificate \u2026 does not have to have a stated value and may be for identifiable goods or services.\u201d[37] Justice Hershfield\u2019s use of the word \u201cand\u201d suggests that he thought that Chief Justice Garon had reached two conclusions: first, that gift certificates do not need to have a stated monetary value, and second, that Service or Good Vouchers could be gift certificates.\n[162] Since a single airline reward point of the type described in Royal Bank did not entitle the bearer to a specific good or service, that the reward point cannot have been a Service or Good Voucher. Therefore, Justice Hershfield must have concluded that each airline reward point was a Pre-Paid Card. The only way that he could have done that is if he interpreted Canasia as having removed any requirement that Pre-Paid Cards have a stated monetary value. As set out above, that is not what Chief Justice Garon concluded.\n[163] In his dissent in CIBC (FCA), Justice Stratas stated that he was affirming \u201cearlier decisions of the Tax Court of Canada and their supporting reasoning to the effect that reward points need not have a fixed dollar value in order to be considered a gift certificate\u201d.[38] Justice Stratas referred to the specific paragraphs of Royal Bank in which Justice Hershfield interpreted the paragraph from Canasia quoted above. It appears that it may not have been brought to Justice Stratas\u2019 attention that Justice Hershfield had drawn something from Canasia that was not there.\n[164] As a result, Justice Stratas viewed Justice Visser as being out of step with Canasia. Respectfully, this is not the case. As noted above, while Justice Visser and I disagree with Chief Justice Garon on the question of whether Service or Good Vouchers are gift certificates, we all agree that Pre-Paid Cards must have a stated monetary value.\n[165] Justice Stratas questioned Justice Visser\u2019s conclusion that a Pre-Paid Card must have a stated monetary value, noting that \u201c[t]he requirement of a fixed dollar value does not have a foundation in the text, context or purpose of the Act.\u201d[39]\n[166] With respect, the text prescribes certain treatment for devices that are \u201cgift certificates\u201d. Those words mean something. They describe a certain type of device. In holding that Pre-Paid Cards must have a stated monetary value, neither Justice Visser, Chief Justice Garon nor I am reading requirements into the Act. We are simply giving ordinary meaning to the text.\n[167] The stated monetary value is part of the normal way that people describe Pre-Paid Cards: \u201cHe got a $50 Amazon gift card for his birthday\u201d; \u201cLet\u2019s give the coach a $20 Tim Hortons card as a thank-you\u201d. If someone simply says, \u201cMy Grandma gave me a gift card to Home Depot\u201d, it is not because the gift card does not have a stated monetary value, but rather because they do not want to share that information.\n[168] A Pre-Paid Card does more than just state its monetary value. Unless the bearer spends some of the value stored on the Pre-Paid Card, its stated monetary value does not change. In this way, Pre-Paid Cards are like money.\n[169] One of the core features of money is that its stated value is fixed. The stated value of a dollar is always a dollar. Its stated value does not change depending on whether I am buying food or furniture. It does not change when I give it to someone else.\n[170] There is a difference between a stated monetary value and an economic value. Because of inflation, the economic value of a dollar today is less than what it was in the past. But its stated monetary value has not changed. It remains what it always has been\u2014one dollar.\n[171] Justice Stratas reasoned that gift certificates need not have a \u201cfixed dollar value\u201d because \u201cother exchange devices, such as foreign currency, whose value in Canadian dollars may change from time to time\u201d, do not.[40] With respect, the stated value of foreign currency does not change. A US dollar is always worth exactly the amount that it is stated on its face\u2014one US dollar. The fact that its economic value may change relative to the economic value of the Canadian dollar does not change the fact that its stated value is fixed.\n[172] Similarly, the stated monetary value of Pre-Paid Cards is always fixed. When I buy a gift certificate from a movie theatre chain for $100, its stated value does not change. It will be $100 whether I use it tomorrow or two years from now. If the price of movies goes up, I may not be able to use it to buy as many movies, but I will still be able to use it to reduce the cost of attending those movies by $100.\n[173] In summary, of the two devices commonly described as \u201cgift certificates\u201d, Pre-Paid Cards always have a stated monetary value and Service and Good Vouchers do not. Since I have concluded that Service and Good Vouchers are not gift certificates, I am left with the inescapable conclusion that a gift certificate must have a stated monetary value. I see nothing in the context or purpose of section 181.2 that would require me to alter the common textual meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d to omit this characteristic. Accordingly, I find that, for a device to be a gift certificate, it must have a stated monetary value.[41]\n[174] To be clear, I have concluded that devices without a stated monetary value cannot be gift certificates. I have not concluded that all devices with a stated monetary value are gift certificates. Devices other than gift certificates may also have a stated monetary value. For example, subsections 181(2) and (3) both refer to coupons that entitle the bearer to a price reduction of a \u201cfixed dollar amount\u201d.\n[175] Justice Visser qualified the stated monetary value characteristic further. He held that the stated monetary value of a gift certificate must either appear on the device\u2019s face or be retrievable electronically.[42] I agree.\n[176] This practical qualification of the stated monetary value characteristic recognizes that some devices are entirely electronic and thus may not have a face upon which the stated monetary value may appear. I am thinking, for example, of a Pre-Paid Card that exists only on an app or in an email.\n[177] It also recognizes that, while some physical Pre-Paid Cards do not state their monetary value on their face, that monetary value can be retrievable electronically by, for example, reading the black strip on the back of the card or inputting a code printed on the card.\n[178] In summary, I will follow Justice Visser\u2019s conclusion in CIBC (TCC). I find that, to be a gift certificate, a device must have a stated monetary value. That stated monetary value must either appear on the device\u2019s face or be retrievable electronically.\nApplication to an Aeroplan Mile [179] An Aeroplan Mile clearly did not have a stated monetary value.\n[180] Nonetheless, TD argues that an Aeroplan Mile meets this test. TD\u2019s argument is based on the idea that an Aeroplan member could roughly calculate the value of an Aeroplan Mile by using websites that offer tools to make such calculations or by comparing the number of Aeroplan Miles needed to purchase a flight through Aeroplan against the cost of that flight on the Air Canada website. There are three problems with this reasoning.\n[181] First, I do not think that Justice Visser\u2019s reference to \u201cretrievable electronically\u201d meant scouring the internet for data.\n[182] Second, the value that TD is referring to is not the stated monetary value of an Aeroplan Mile but rather its economic value. I do not doubt that an Aeroplan Mile has economic value. That was established by this Court in Johnson v. The Queen[43] and Hope Air v. The Queen.[44] However, the fact that an Aeroplan Mile has economic value is irrelevant. The characteristic that gift certificates must have is a stated monetary value, not simply being worth something.\n[183] Third, because an Aeroplan Mile could generally not be transferred, its economic value depended on who held it and could not truly be determined until it was used to make a purchase.[45] An Aeroplan Mile had more economic value if it was used to buy a flight than if it was used to acquire other goods or services through the Aeroplan store.[46] The economic value of an Aeroplan Mile used to buy a seat on a given flight could differ significantly depending on whether the seat was a \u201cclassic grid\u201d seat or a \u201cmarket fare\u201d seat. Because of the benefits of \u201cDistinction\u201d status, the number of Aeroplan Miles needed to buy a flight could vary by as much as 35% depending on how many Aeroplan Miles the member had earned in the previous year. Additionally, the Agreement actually contemplated the economic value of an Aeroplan Mile in the \u201cclassic grid\u201d potentially being adjusted annually based on certain formulae. Finally, Aeroplan retained the right to amend its program, including adjusting redemption pricing upwards or downwards.\n[184] Ultimately, a single Aeroplan Mile simply represented a promise that, if combined with enough other Aeroplan Miles, the bearer might someday be able to use them to acquire an as-yet unspecified and unascertainable good or service. A cardholder could only determine the economic value of an Aeroplan Mile once they had enough other Aeroplan Miles to be able to purchase something.\n[185] In fact, in its general terms and conditions of membership, Aeroplan specifically warned its members that:[47]\n[t]he accumulation of Aeroplan Miles does not entitle members to any vested rights and, in accumulating Aeroplan Miles, members may not rely upon the continued availability of any award, reward, award\/reward grid or level, premium, privilege program or other benefit. Changes to any of these matters may affect Aeroplan Miles that a member has already accumulated, as well as any future accumulation of Aeroplan Miles.\n[186] On the basis of all of the foregoing, I find that an Aeroplan Mile did not have a stated monetary value. This is sufficient to find that it was not a gift certificate, but I will nonetheless describe and analyze the remaining characteristics.\nC. Use for Payment Characteristic [187] In CIBC (TCC), Justice Visser held that the bearer of a gift certificate must be entitled to have the balance of the stored monetary value applied to the purchase price of goods or services purchased from either the issuer of the gift certificate or any other person who can lawfully accept the gift certificate as payment.[48]\n[188] I agree. This is consistent with Chief Justice Garon\u2019s view of the characteristics of Pre-Paid Cards.[49]\n[189] It is important to note that Justice Visser did not simply say that it must be possible to use a gift certificate as full or partial consideration for a supply. As discussed above, that same condition applies to coupons. Instead, Justice Visser referred to the bearer being entitled to apply the balance of the device\u2019s stored monetary value. In doing so, Justice Visser indirectly articulated a key characteristic of gift certificates.\n[190] Because gift certificates are a storage mechanism for money, the bearer can use part of their stated monetary value for one purchase and keep the balance of their stated monetary value for future purchases.\n[191] In this way, gift certificates are very much like money. If I have a $100 bill and I want to buy a $30 toque, I use $30 of the bill\u2019s value to buy the toque and receive $70 in change that I can apply to future purchases.\n[192] On the basis of the foregoing, I find that, for a device to be a gift certificate, the bearer must be entitled to apply some or all of the balance of the stored monetary value to the purchase price of goods or services purchased from either the issuer of the device or any other person who can lawfully accept the device as payment.\nApplication to an Aeroplan Mile [193] Since I have concluded that an Aeroplan Mile did not have a stated monetary value, it is not possible for it to meet a condition that requires the bearer to be able to use some or all of that stated monetary value to make a purchase.\nD. Transferable Without Cost Characteristic [194] In Canasia, Chief Justice Garon found that, for a device to be a gift certificate, it must be transferrable to a third party.[50] I agree. Gift certificates are called \u201cgift\u201d certificates precisely because people routinely buy them for the purpose of gifting them to others.\n[195] I would, however, expand on this requirement. In order to reflect the core element that a gift certificate must have attributes similar to those of money, I find that a purchaser must be able to transfer a gift certificate to a third party without additional payment to the issuer.\n[196] If I want to give $100 to my friend, I do not have to pay a fee to the Crown to do so. I may have to pay a fee to my bank for the service of transferring the money, but my bank is not the issuer of the money. Similarly, no one who buys a $100 gift certificate from a clothing retailer would expect to be told that they would need to pay an extra $10 if they want to give it to their friend.\n[197] It is important to clarify that the fact that the bearer of a device transfers it to a third party for consideration in no way precludes the device from being a gift certificate. Chief Justice Garon observed that, despite the use of the word \u201cgift\u201d, a purchaser may transfer a gift certificate to a third party for free, for some consideration or for full consideration without changing the device\u2019s status as a gift certificate.[51] I agree entirely. My concern is with fees charged by the issuer of the device, not with consideration paid by someone purchasing it from the bearer.\n[198] On the basis of all of the foregoing, I find that, for a device to be a gift certificate, the bearer must be able to transfer it to a third party without paying a fee to the issuer.\nApplication to an Aeroplan Mile [199] An Aeroplan Mile does not have this characteristic. Aeroplan\u2019s general terms and conditions specifically prohibit the transfer of Aeroplan Miles.[52]\n[200] Mr. Hall testified that it was possible to transfer an Aeroplan Mile to a friend or family member but not without paying Aeroplan a fee of $0.03 to $0.035 per Aeroplan Mile. While this fee is expressed in cents, it is anything but inconsequential. In fact, it is |||||||||||||| |||||||||||||| the price that TD paid to buy an Aeroplan Mile from Aeroplan. At these prices, transferring your brother enough points to buy a round trip from Toronto to Vancouver on the \u201cclassic grid\u201d would have cost you between $750 and $875.[53] You would most likely have been better off just giving him the cash.\nE. Limited Conditions Characteristic [201] Justice Visser held that a device can have terms and conditions regarding its use and still be a gift certificate, but those terms and conditions must not detract from the essential attribute of a gift certificate that it must have attributes similar to those of money.[54] I agree.\n[202] In Canasia, Chief Justice Garon held that the voucher for a free flight before him was not a gift certificate because it could only be used if the bearer agreed to pay for a week\u2019s worth of hotel accommodation at a select list of hotels.\n[203] Similarly, in Royal Bank, Justice Hershfield found that the airline reward points before him were not gift certificates because there were too many conditions on their use.\n[204] An Aeroplan Mile had many terms and conditions restricting its use. I will examine the key ones.[55]\nNeed to Accumulate More [205] A single Aeroplan Mile could not be used without first spending a significant amount of additional money to either accumulate or buy more Aeroplan Miles.[56]\n[206] For example, if a cardholder who was using the TD Aeroplan credit card with the best return of Aeroplan Miles for each dollar spent had a single Aeroplan Mile and wanted to buy a 25,000 Aeroplan Mile flight, they would have to have spent an additional $19,999 on their credit card to accumulate the additional 24,999 Aeroplan Miles they needed.[57] This is in addition to the $399 annual fee that the cardholder would have to pay to keep earning Aeroplan Miles on their card.[58]\n[207] TD argues that conditions regarding the accumulation of Aeroplan Miles have nothing to do with their use and are thus irrelevant. This is a distinction without a difference. I have to determine whether a single Aeroplan Mile is a gift certificate. A single Aeroplan Mile cannot be used without accumulating or buying many other Aeroplan Miles. The fact that the bearer spends the money to acquire the additional Aeroplan Miles does not change the fact that they must do so if they want to use the single Aeroplan Mile that they have.\n[208] In this way, an Aeroplan Mile is very unlike a Pre-Paid Card. While a Pre-Paid Card with a small stated monetary value might not buy much, there is no condition on its use that requires the bearer to acquire more Pre-Paid Cards to use it.\n[209] I find this to be a very significant condition that strongly supports the idea that an Aeroplan Mile is not a gift certificate.\nExpiration of Aeroplan Miles [210] As described above, an Aeroplan member\u2019s Aeroplan Miles would automatically expire if the member did not earn or redeem any Aeroplan Miles in a 12-month period. TD made arrangements with Aeroplan so that this would not happen to its customers. However, that did not change the nature of an Aeroplan Mile itself. The same expiry conditions existed. It was just that TD made sure that the conditions were not met as long as the member remained a cardholder. If the member ceased to be a cardholder, the Aeroplan Mile would expire as usual.\n[211] Justice Visser specifically found that a reasonable expiry date would not, in itself, prevent an Aeroplan Mile from being a gift certificate.[59] Justice Stratas took a similar approach.[60] I agree.\n[212] While my understanding is that provincial legislation generally prevents gift certificates from expiring or limits the conditions under which they can expire,[61] that does not mean that a device that may expire cannot be a gift certificate. On the contrary, it is a reminder that, prior to such legislation being introduced, it was possible for gift certificates to expire.\n[213] In summary, while the potential for an Aeroplan Mile to expire is one way in which it is not like money, I put little weight on this condition.\nCancellation of the Program [214] An Aeroplan Mile could be cancelled if Aeroplan went into default or shut down the program. This was not just a theoretical risk. Mr. Rasmussen testified that there were periods when TD worried about this possibility, particularly when Aeroplan\u2019s contract with Air Canada came up for renewal.\n[215] That said, I do not consider this to be a significant condition. The risk that the issuer will fail is present with any type of device.\nRevocation of Membership [216] Aeroplan could also revoke a member\u2019s membership for fraudulent activities. This condition is unrelated to the nature of an Aeroplan Mile.\nReturn of Aeroplan Miles [217] There were limited circumstances in which an Aeroplan Mile that had already been awarded would have to be returned. TD would require a customer to return an Aeroplan Mile if it had been obtained through fraud or had been awarded through a processing error.\n[218] Failure to make payments on an outstanding credit card balance would prevent a customer from earning additional Aeroplan Miles because their card would be frozen, but this would not result in a previously awarded Aeroplan Mile having to be returned.\n[219] If the purchase that had given rise to the award of Aeroplan Miles was later refunded by a merchant, the original award did not typically have to be returned. The refund would simply reduce the number of Aeroplan Miles awarded to the customer in the credit card period in which the refund occurred.\n[220] Overall, I do not find these conditions to be significant. They are simply designed to protect Aeroplan from its members abusing the program.\nSummary [221] In summary, most of the conditions attached to an Aeroplan Mile involve standard or relatively limited risks. They would not prevent an Aeroplan Mile from being a gift certificate.\n[222] However, the need to accumulate more Aeroplan Miles is a significant condition that makes an Aeroplan Mile very unlike a Pre-Paid Card. I find that it is one more reason why an Aeroplan Mile is not a gift certificate.\nF. Non-Characteristics [223] I would like to briefly discuss three things that I do not consider to be characteristics of a gift certificate.\nConsideration [224] In ordinary usage, the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d would describe a device that was issued for consideration. However, a contextual analysis shows that that is not what Parliament intended.\n[225] Section 181.2 states that \u201cthe issuance or sale of a gift certificate for consideration shall be deemed not to be a supply\u201d. In CIBC (TCC), Justice Visser interpreted these words as meaning that a device did not have to be issued or sold for consideration in order for it to be a gift certificate.[62] I agree.\n[226] There would have been no reason to include the words \u201cfor consideration\u201d in section 181.2 unless Parliament thought that gift certificates could be issued or sold without consideration. Section 181.2 denies its beneficial tax treatment to a device if the device is not issued for consideration, but it does not require a device to have been issued for consideration for it to be a gift certificate.\n[227] In addition, section 181.2 only says that there has to be consideration. It does not specify the amount of consideration. Thus, a gift card with a $100 stated monetary value could still enjoy the benefits of section 181.2 even though it was issued for $1.\n[228] On the basis of the foregoing, since consideration is not necessary for a device to be a gift certificate, it cannot be a characteristic of a gift certificate.\nA Substitute for Currency [229] TD submits that an Aeroplan Mile is a gift certificate because it is a substitute for currency. I disagree.\n[230] I have emphasized above that gift certificates should have attributes similar to those of money. But that is very different from saying that any device that can be used like money must be a gift certificate.\n[231] In essence, TD argues that gift certificates can be used like money, that an Aeroplan Mile can be used like money and therefore that an Aeroplan Mile must be a gift certificate. The flaw in this logic is self-evident.\n[232] The reality is that the only way that an Aeroplan Mile is like money is that it can be used to pay for goods and services. So can coupons, barter units, cryptocurrency and gift certificates. The ability to use a device like money does not help me to distinguish among these devices.\n[233] In his testimony, Mr. Rhodes frequently referred to Aeroplan Miles being \u201ccurrency\u201d. He appeared to believe that it was important to use this term whenever possible. The fact that the term did not come up in either Mr. Ahmed\u2019s or Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s testimony suggests to me that it is not a common term either at TD or in the industry. I place no weight or significance on Mr. Rhodes\u2019 use of that term.\nRevenue Recognition [234] TD called Patricia O\u2019Malley as an expert witness in international financial reporting standards. Ms. O\u2019Malley testified that companies that sell gift certificates and companies that issue or sell rewards points are supposed to account for their revenue in the same way. In simple terms, the revenue is deferred and then recognized when the gift certificate or rewards points are redeemed.\n[235] Ms. O\u2019Malley\u2019s evidence does not assist me in interpreting the meaning of the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d. The accounting standards that she described are focused on the timing and method of revenue recognition. The Act taxes consumption, not revenue.\n[236] In addition, the accounting standards that Ms. O\u2019Malley described would apply equally to pre-payments and deposits and to the sale of other goods and services that are nothing like gift certificates.\n[237] On the basis of the foregoing, I find that revenue recognition is not a characteristic of a gift certificate.\nG. Conclusion [238] On the basis of all of the foregoing, I find that, for a device to be a gift certificate, it must have the following key characteristics:\n(a)The device must have a stated monetary value that either appears on the device\u2019s face or is retrievable electronically.\n(b)It must be possible to transfer the device to a third party without additional payment to the issuer.\n(c)The bearer must be entitled to apply some or all of the balance of the stored monetary value to the purchase price of goods or services purchased from either the issuer of the device or any other person who can lawfully accept the device as payment.\n(d) The device may have some conditions, but any such conditions must not detract from the essential attribute of a gift certificate that it must have attributes similar to those of money.\n[239] An Aeroplan Mile had none of these characteristics. It did not have a stated monetary value and thus that value could not be applied towards a purchase. It was not transferrable without paying a fee to Aeroplan. Finally, the need to accumulate more Aeroplan Miles in order to use a single Aeroplan Mile was a significant condition on the device\u2019s use.\n[240] The meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d may encompass a variety of devices, but I cannot conceive of any interpretation that could be so broad as to capture an Aeroplan Mile.\nH. TD\u2019s Policy Arguments [241] Before turning to the remaining issue, I need to address TD\u2019s policy arguments.\n[242] TD points to potential risks of double taxation, double non-taxation, tax being charged at the wrong rate, tax on phantom supplies, and an incentive for consumers to pay using Aeroplan Miles instead of cash as reasons why I should find that Aeroplan Miles are gift certificates. TD argues that treating Aeroplan Miles as gift certificates would avoid all of these problems. This may be the case, but it is not my role to fix problems with the Act.\n[243] If TD had been able to point me to any commonly understood meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d that would capture anything like an Aeroplan Mile, I could have considered its policy arguments through a purposive analysis of section 181.2.\n[244] A purposive analysis can either help the Court to choose between competing textual interpretations or reveal unexpected textual ambiguity. It cannot, however, form the basis for imposing a meaning that is not supported by the text in order to achieve a certain policy objective.\n[245] If a statute prevents residents of a certain city from keeping horses in their yards, one could turn to a purposive analysis to help determine whether the term \u201chorses\u201d includes donkeys and mules. One could not, however, decide that \u201chorses\u201d must include bears and moose simply because the presence of these animals is potentially harmful to residents.\n[246] As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman:[63]\n\u2026 [Policy considerations] cannot be permitted to distort the actual words of the statute, read harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, its object, and the intention of the legislature, so as to make the provision say something it does not. While policy analysis has a legitimate role in the interpretative process ..., the responsibility for setting policy in a parliamentary democracy rests with the legislature, not with the courts. The primary role of the courts, in my view, is to interpret and apply those laws according to their terms, provided they are lawfully enacted. It is not the role of this Court to rewrite the legislation.\n[247] The ordinary textual meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d includes both Pre-Paid Cards and Service or Good Vouchers. The context and purpose of section 181.2 and subsection 181(4) helped me to determine that Parliament only intended to capture Pre-Paid Cards. However, there is no ordinary textual meaning of \u201cgift certificate\u201d that would include a device like Aeroplan Miles. An Aeroplan Mile has none of the characteristics of a gift certificate. No one (other than various banks seeking GST relief) ever uses the term \u201cgift certificate\u201d to describe a reward point. As a result, no matter how compelling TD\u2019s policy arguments are, there is no basis upon which I can interpret \u201cgift certificate\u201d to give effect to them.\n[248] While I accept that the coupon and gift certificate provisions in the Act are arguably ill equipped to deal with reward points, there are competing interests at stake. To put it bluntly, TD wants to shift the GST burden on Aeroplan Miles from itself to its cardholders. TD would not describe it that way, but that is the logical outcome of the interpretation that it is seeking. If Aeroplan or its members were before me, I imagine that they would be arguing for quite a different policy outcome.\n[249] The Retail Council of Canada (\u201cRCC\u201d) sought leave to intervene in this appeal on behalf of its members who participate in rewards programs.[64] Many of those retailers treat rewards points as coupons rather than as gift certificates. They were concerned that I might interpret \u201cgift certificate\u201d in a manner that could upend the basis of those programs.\n[250] Justice Sommerfeldt dismissed the RCC\u2019s motion for a number of reasons. One was that:[65]\n\u2026 RCC\u2019s intervention would become a policy-based argument focusing on loyalty programs in general, rather than assisting the Court in its interpretation of the provisions of the [Act] that are relevant to this specific Appeal, and in its determination of whether the issuance of Aeroplan Miles was the supply of gift certificates. \u2026\n[251] In other words, Justice Sommerfeldt was concerned that the RCC would make exactly the type of policy-based argument that TD is now trying to make. The RCC wanted to argue that treating rewards points as gift certificates instead of as coupons is bad policy. TD is arguing that treating Aeroplan Miles as coupons instead of as gift certificates is bad policy.\n[252] Ultimately, it is not my role to weigh the needs of different groups against each other and against the needs of the fisc. That job belongs to Parliament. Parliament is surely aware of the problems that TD has identified. It may also be aware of other problems that would arise for other reward programs if I expanded the meaning of \u201cgift certificates\u201d in the way that TD wants. If TD wants legislative change, Parliament is where it should seek it.\nIX. Payments to CIBC [253] As set out above, when TD replaced CIBC as the exclusive Aeroplan Visa provider, TD acquired a significant number of CIBC\u2019s cardholders. TD paid CIBC to purchase those cardholders\u2019 credit card balances. This payment is not in issue.\n[254] TD could not simply take over the cardholders\u2019 accounts immediately. Both CIBC and TD needed time to transition the cardholders from one institution to the other. As a result, the parties entered into an Interim Services Agreement pursuant to which CIBC continued to manage these cardholders\u2019 accounts during a transition period.\n[255] During that transition period, the cardholders still earned Aeroplan Miles on their purchases. Aeroplan invoiced CIBC for those Aeroplan Miles. CIBC, in turn, invoiced TD. Those invoices included GST. TD paid the invoices (the \u201cCIBC Payments\u201d) and is now seeking a rebate of that GST.\n[256] TD takes the position that the CIBC Payments were supplies of Aeroplan Miles. The Respondent disagrees. It also raised two preliminary objections in respect of this issue.\nSpecified Person Objection [257] The Respondent again argues that TD failed to raise this issue in its notice of objection and is thus precluded by subsection 306.1(1) from arguing it on appeal. While TD included the GST paid to CIBC in the relief that it sought, TD indicated that all of the amounts for which it sought rebates had been paid to Aeroplan. Its notice of objection did not mention CIBC. TD gave the auditor invoices from CIBC, but not a copy of the Interim Services Agreement.\n[258] However, the audit report (known as a \u201crebate report\u201d) indicates that the auditor was aware that some of the rebate claim covered specific payments to CIBC. The auditor chose to treat those payments the same way as the payments to Aeroplan were treated. In Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited v. The Queen[66], Justice Boyle held that the Minister cannot claim to have been unaware of an issue that was clearly before the auditor.\n[259] In addition, the Report on Objection clearly acknowledges that the CIBC Payments were part of the amount in dispute.\n[260] On the basis of all of the foregoing, while TD\u2019s notice of objection did not set out the facts and reasons necessary to support its rebate claim for the CIBC Payments, I accept that the issue itself and the related relief were sufficiently identified and therefore that TD is not precluded by subsection 306.1(1) from arguing the issue.\nPleadings [261] In the alternative, the Respondent submits that TD failed to raise any issue in its Notice of Appeal relating to the CIBC Payments, has not amended its Notice of Appeal to do so and thus is precluded from raising that issue at trial.\n[262] I do not accept that the Respondent was caught off guard by TD\u2019s failure to specifically identify the CIBC Payments in its Notice of Appeal. Appendix \u201cA\u201d to the Reply specifically identified the exact amount of the GST charged on the CIBC Payments.\n[263] At audit, the Minister took the overall position that TD was buying Aeroplan Miles and that those Aeroplan Miles were not gift certificates. That position would have applied equally to the CIBC Payments. Since TD appealed to the Court before the Minister could consider its objection, that position did not change. It was the position reflected in the original Reply.\n[264] The specific treatment of the CIBC Payments only arose indirectly when, in response to CIBC (FCA), the Respondent changed his position on the predominant element issue to argue that Aeroplan was supplying marketing services. This occurred well after pleadings had closed. The Notice of Appeal does not address this issue because it was not an issue until the Respondent changed his position.\nMerits [265] The Respondent does not have any real basis for disputing that the payments to CIBC were for Aeroplan Miles. The invoices issued to TD by CIBC show that TD was being charged for the number of Aeroplan Miles provided to its cardholders. The price per Aeroplan Mile was identical to the price that TD paid to Aeroplan.\n[266] I do not have to decide whether CIBC was acting as TD\u2019s agent in acquiring Aeroplan Miles from Aeroplan or whether CIBC was simply re-supplying Aeroplan Miles that it had acquired from Aeroplan. Either way, I am satisfied that the CIBC Payments were for Aeroplan Miles.\n[267] That said, given my conclusion on the gift certificate issue, TD would still not be entitled to a rebate in respect of these amounts.\nX. Conclusion [268] On the basis of all of the foregoing, the appeals are dismissed.\nSigned at Fredericton, New Brunswick, this 30th day of April 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

Both parties filed written submissions.\n[2] In its written submissions, the Appellant is asking for a lump sum cost award of $1,298,180.81, comprised of the following:\n-$1,095,444.90 in respect of legal fees, which represents 90% of counsel\u2019s fees of $1,217,161;\n-$92,618.42 for disbursements incurred by the Appellant;\n-$35,000 for counsel\u2019s fee in preparing the Appellant\u2019s cost submissions; and\n-$75,117.49 for unrecoverable HST.\n[3] The Respondent agrees that the Appellant should be awarded enhanced costs, but argues that such costs should be no more than 30% of reasonable legal fees, plus all reasonable and necessary disbursements supported by dockets and invoices.\n[4] The issue in these appeals is the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to input tax credits under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act[2] (the \u201cGST Act\u201d) with respect to the GST\/HST it paid on goods and services that it acquired in the course of its business of providing a ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The amount at issue in the two appeals is in excess of $7 million.\n[5] The issues in the appeals included:\n-whether the Appellant applied its methodology in a fair and reasonable or consistent manner;\n-whether the Appellant\u2019s terminal facilities and the outside deck area of the Appellant\u2019s vessels were areas that contribute to the making of both taxable or exempt supplies or were areas that were only used to make exempt supplies; and\n-whether the Appellant\u2019s cost of fuel should be allocated to taxable supplies using the Appellant\u2019s methodology.\n[6] The Appellant was successful on all issues.\nThe Law\n[7] Subsection 147(1) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure)[3] (the \u201cRules\u201d) provides that \u201c[t]he Court may determine the amount of the costs of all parties involved in any proceedings, the allocation of those costs and the persons required to pay them.\u201d\n[8] In Velcro Canada Inc. v. The Queen[4], at paragraph 9, Associate Chief Justice Rossiter (as he then was) stated the following with respect to the principles the Court should follow when it is considering the awarding of costs:\n[. . .] it is my view that:\n1. The Tariff was never intended to compensate a litigant fully for legal expenses incurred in an appeal;\n2. The Tariff was also never intended to be so paltry as to be insignificant and play a trivial role for litigants in dealing with their litigation. The Court\u2019s discretionary power is always available to fix amounts as appropriate;\n3. Costs should be awarded by the Court in its sole and absolute discretion after considering the factors of subsection 147(3) [of the General Procedure Rules];\n4. The discretion of the Court must be exercised on a principled basis;\n5. The factors in Rule 147(3) [of the General Procedure Rules] are the key considerations in the Court\u2019s determination of costs awards as well as the quantum and in determining if the Court should move away from the Tariff;\n6. In the normal course the Court should apply the factors of Rule 147(3) [of the General Procedure Rules] on a principled basis, with submissions from the parties as to costs, and only reference the Tariff at its discretion; and\n7. The manner that the Tariff is referenced in Rule 147 [of the General Procedure Rules] indicates the insignificance of the Tariff in costs considerations.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[9] More recently, in MacDonald v. The Queen[5], at paragraphs 42 to 45, my colleague, Justice Lafleur, stated the following with respect to the key principles:\nSection 147 of the Rules gives the Court a very broad discretion in awarding costs . . . . However, the discretion of the Court must be exercised on a principled basis and should not be exercised in an arbitrary manner (The Queen v Lau, 2004 FCA 10 at para 5, [2004] GSTC 5, and The Queen v Landry, 2010 FCA 135 at paras 22 and 54, 2010 DTC 5106).\nNone of the factors listed in subsection 147(3) are determinative and the Court should consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion (Velcro Canada Inc. v The Queen, 2012 TCC 273 at paras 12-13, [2012] 6 CTC 2049 [Velcro]).\nAn award of costs is generally not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party (Velcro, supra at para 29). The objectives of an award of costs are compensation and contribution, and not punishment (Mariano et al v The Queen, 2016 TCC 161 at paras 23 and 27, 2016 DTC 1146.\nAs explained by Justice Boyle in Martin v The Queen, 2014 TCC 50, 2014 DTC 1072 (para 14):\n14 . . . The proper question is: What should be the losing party\u2019s appropriate contribution to the successful party\u2019s costs of pursuing the appeal in which his or her position prevailed?\n[10] Subsection 147(3) of the Rules reads as follows:\nIn exercising its discretionary power pursuant to subsection (1) the Court may consider,\n(a) the result of the proceeding,\n(b) the amounts in issue,\n(c) the importance of the issues,\n(d) any offer of settlement made in writing,\n(e) the volume of work,\n(f) the complexity of the issues,\n(g) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding,\n(h) the denial or the neglect or refusal of any party to admit anything that should have been admitted,\n(i) whether any stage in the proceedings was,\n(i) improper, vexatious, or unnecessary, or\n(ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution,\n(j) any other matter relevant to the question of costs\n[11] I will now consider each of the relevant factors.\nConsideration of Relevant Factors\nA. Result of the Proceedings\n[12] As I noted previously, the Appellant was successful on all issues before the Court. The Appellant and the Respondent agree that the result of the proceedings favours an increased cost award.\n[13] The fact that there were multiple issues before the Court and the Appellant was successful on all of the issues favours an award of higher costs.[6]\nB. Amount at Issue\n[14] The Appellant argues that the amount at issue, before taking into account the 50% rebate for public service bodies, was $19,716,588 comprised of:\n-$2,629,689 for its GST reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010;\n-$7,184,132 for its GST reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and January 31, 2012; plus\n- $9,902,767 of input tax credits that the Appellant claimed for its GST reporting periods ending between February 1, 2012 and March 31, 2023. The Appellant notes that the CRA has held the Appellant\u2019s claim for the $9,902,767 of input tax credits in abeyance pending the outcome in these appeals.\n[15] The Respondent argues that the amount at issue, after taking into the 50% rebate for public service bodies, was $7,256,080 comprised of:\n-$2,629,689 for the Appellant\u2019s GST reporting periods ending between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010;\n-$9,252,782 for the Appellant\u2019s GST reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and January 31, 2012; minus\n- The 50% rebate for public service bodies.\n[16] The Respondent has assumed that the public service body rebate was $4,626,391 ($2,629,689 plus $9,252,782 - $7,256,080).\n[17] I agree with the Appellant that the $9,902,767 in respect of the reporting periods of the Appellant ending between February 1, 2012 and March 31, 2023 should also be considered since the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the related input tax credits is dependent on the outcome of this appeal.[7]\n[18] I have not been able to reconcile the Appellant\u2019s and the Respondent\u2019s numbers with respect to the amount at issue. I have assumed that the amount at issue (before taking into account the public service body rebate) is somewhere between the amount calculated by the Appellant ($19,716,588) and the amount calculated by the Respondent ($21,785,238).[8]\n[19] This amount at issue is clearly significant to the Appellant and favours an award of enhanced costs.\nC. The Importance of the Issue\n[20] The importance of the issue is not a factor that the Appellant relies on to support its request for enhanced costs.\n[21] The Respondent argues that this factor is generally neutral when an appeal, such as the one before the Court, is disposed of on findings of fact since the appeal has little precedential value.\n[22] However, the Respondent states that the Court\u2019s finding with respect to the Appellant\u2019s allocation methodology may establish a precedent for other similar transportation providers and as such, this factor slightly favours enhanced costs.\n[23] I do not believe that this factor is significant in this appeal. My decision was based primarily on findings of fact. My finding with respect to the Appellant\u2019s allocation methodology has no precedential value; it was based on existing jurisprudence.\nD. Volume of Work\n[24] The Appellant argues that the volume of work was substantial and supports its claim for enhanced costs. It noted that the litigation involved over 1700 hours of counsel time, over 1000 hours of time for the employees of the Appellant, two separate days of discovery, lengthy undertaking answers, 11 hearing days and 7 volumes of documents.[9]\n[25] The Respondent acknowledges that the volume of work was above average with seven volumes of documents, multiple days of discovery and trial and detailed written submissions. The Respondent argues that while this favours enhanced costs, parties made litigation decisions that required additional work and thus both parties bear some responsibility.\n[26] The volume of work only slightly favours an award of enhanced costs. I would expect that the volume of work would be above average in an appeal that is fact dependent.\nE. Complexity of the Issues\n[27] The complexity of the issues is not a factor that the Appellant relies on to support its request for enhanced costs.\n[28] The Respondent argues, at paragraph 25 of his written submissions, that the appeal involved technical provisions in a technical statute and \u201cas such, the process of both eliciting and applying the relevant facts to the law was an inherently complex process\u201d. He believes this favours an enhanced award.\n[29] I agree with the Respondent that section 141.01, the key provision of the GST Act when dealing with indirect costs, is a complex provision. However, its operation has been explained in detail in previous decisions of this Court.\n[30] I do not find that the complexity of the issues favours an award of enhanced costs.\nF. Conduct of the Parties\n[31] The factors just discussed support both the Appellant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s positions that the Appellant should be awarded enhanced costs. The issue is whether the amount of the enhanced costs should be 30% or less as argued by the Respondent, or a substantially higher percentage as argued by the Appellant.\n[32] The answer to that question can be found in the conduct of the parties, specifically the conduct of the Respondent.\n[33] The primary issues with respect to the conduct of the Respondent was his substantial delay in following existing jurisprudence and his filing of an affidavit sworn by Mr. Jonathan Shimizu, a CRA tax appeals case specialist (the \u201cShimizu Affidavit\u201d).\n[34] On June 21, 2013 and July 4, 2013, the Appellant and the Respondent agreed to be bound by the decision of this Court in British Columbia Ferry Services Inc. v. The Queen[10] (\u201cBC Ferries\u201d) with respect to:\n-whether the passenger cabins, sleeper dorms and reserved seating (the \u201cUpgraded Accommodations\u201d) were used exclusively in taxable activities or exclusively in exempt activities;\n-whether the vessels\u2019 infrastructure comprised of engine rooms, crew and officers quarters and navigational bridge decks are part of the common areas that are used in both taxable and exempt activities or part of the areas that are used exclusively in exempt activity; and\n- whether fuel that is used for the propulsion of the vessels is used in both taxable and exempt activities or used exclusively in exempt activity. [11]\n[35] On October 14, 2014, this Court issued its decision in BC Ferries concluding that the upgraded accommodations in that appeal were used exclusively in taxable activities and the infrastructure of the vessels in that appeal were part of the common areas used in both taxable and exempt activities.\n[36] Notwithstanding frequent requests by the Appellant, beginning in December 2014, for the Respondent to accept the decision of this Court in BC Ferries,[12] the Respondent maintained his position until November 30, 2020, that the Upgraded Accommodations and noted infrastructure were used exclusively in exempt activities.[13]\n[37] As noted at paragraph 65 of my reasons for judgment, the Respondent filed a concession letter with the Court in September 2021, just before the commencement of the oral hearing, conceding that the Appellant used the Upgraded Accommodations exclusively in taxable activities and the infrastructure was part of the common areas used to make both taxable and exempt supplies.\n[38] The Appellant explains in its written submissions (with specific examples) that the Respondent\u2019s delay in acknowledging the decision of this Court in BC Ferries caused the Appellant to needlessly expend over 1,000 hours and incur substantial costs. A significant amount of this time related to satisfying undertakings relating to the measurement of the common areas of the vessel.\n[39] The additional costs included the hiring of the engineering firm discussed at paragraph 144 of my reasons for judgment.\n[40] As I noted at paragraphs 133 and 165 of my reasons for judgment, under the Appellant\u2019s final method for allocating costs (a methodology that was accepted by the Respondent), there was no need to measure the common areas of the vessels.\n[41] I have concluded, based on the detailed submissions provided by the Appellant, that the Appellant would have avoided substantial costs if the Respondent had fulfilled his obligation under the agreement to be bound and admitted in late 2014 that the infrastructure was part of the common areas of the vessels and the Upgraded Accommodations were used exclusively in taxable activities.\n[42] The Respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to the Upgraded Accommodations and the common areas supports a finding of enhanced costs of substantially more than 30%.\n[43] At paragraph 28 of his written submissions, the Respondent refers to the conduct of the Appellant, stating that the Appellant refused to be bound by BC Ferries. I assume he is referring to the issue of whether the fuel that was used for propulsion of the vessels is used in both taxable and exempt activities.\n[44] This appears to be one of three instances where the Respondent is using cost submissions to question a decision of this Court. In this instance, it is the decision of my former colleague, Justice Lyons, in respect of a motion brought by the Respondent.\n[45] In June of 2015, the Respondent brought a motion for an order \u201cthat the Appellant is bound by its agreement that fuel used for the propulsion of the vessels (ferries) is used exclusively in exempt activity.\u201d\n[46] In dismissing the motion, Justice Lyons stated at paragraph 48, \u201cGiven my previous findings, it appears that Marine [the Appellant] did not renege on the Agreement\u201d.[14]\n[47] It is improper for the Respondent to argue in his cost submissions that the Appellant refused to be bound by BC Ferries, when the Court has previously found that the Appellant did not renege on the agreement to be bound.\n[48] The second area in which the Respondent\u2019s conduct supports a finding of enhanced costs is his conduct with respect to the Shimizu Affidavit.\n[49] I discussed the filing of the affidavit at length in paragraphs 23 to 56 of my reasons for judgment. I made the following findings:\n-The Respondent\u2019s actions in filing the affidavit was a blatant attempt at trial by ambush in respect of a key issue in the appeals.\n-An affidavit, such as the Shimizu Affidavit, has no place in a trial where the facts are in issue, such as the trial before the Court.\n- The Respondent\u2019s actions in filing the Shimizu Affidavit resulted in trial days being thrown away, additional written submissions having to be prepared and filed and an additional day of testimony by two witnesses. Further, argument was delayed from October 1, 2021 to January 2022.\n[50] I also stated the following, at paragraphs 40 and 41 of my reasons for judgment, with respect to the Respondent\u2019s recent practice of not calling witnesses at the hearings of taxpayers\u2019 appeals:\nThe Respondent\u2019s actions in these appeals are consistent with a troubling trend of the Respondent not bringing witnesses to the hearings of taxpayers\u2019 appeals and then attempting to enter evidence through affidavits. Recently, the Court has seen this happen frequently in informal proceedings. The Respondent now appears to be attempting to use the same ill-advised approach in general proceedings.\nIn my view, this conduct must stop. The Court issues judgments based on the evidence before it. If the Respondent wishes to rely on facts that he cannot obtain through cross-examination of the Appellant\u2019s witnesses, then he needs to bring witnesses. Considering the vast resources of the CRA, this should not be an issue.\n[51] In summary, I found that the Respondent\u2019s conduct in regards to the affidavit was improper.\n[52] The Appellant argues that the Respondent\u2019s conduct regarding the Shimizu Affidavit was reprehensible, scandalous and outrageous.\n[53] While the Respondent admits that his conduct regarding the Shimizu Affidavit favours an enhanced cost award since it lengthened the duration of the proceeding, he argues that the conduct was not improper, vexatious or unnecessary, nor taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution. The Respondent states, at paragraph 30 of his written submissions, \u201cOn the contrary, the Affidavit, including the testimony and argument with respect to its contents, was essential to provide much-needed context for the Minister\u2019s fuel assumptions\u201d.\n[54] The Respondent then argues at paragraph 34 of his submissions that the timing of the Shimizu Affidavit disclosure was not improper. He states, \u201cBoth the text of s.89(1) of the Rules and the Court\u2019s jurisprudence demonstrates that s.89 is not complete bar to adducing affidavits under s. 335(5) of the Act (and its sister provision s. 244(9) of the Income Tax Act) without notice at the hearing.\u201d\n[55] The Respondent is, in effect, challenging my finding that his conduct resulted in a trial by ambush and the Shimizu Affidavit had no place in a trial such as the one before the Court. This is improper; a party should never use cost submissions to question a finding made by the Court in the related appeal.\n[56] Further, the Respondent\u2019s submissions indicate that he is prepared to engage in similar offensive behaviour in the future.\n[57] I find that the Respondent\u2019s improper actions in attempting a trial by ambush, combined with the factors previously discussed, supports a finding of enhanced costs of more than 30%. I find that his belief that he did nothing wrong and that he can engage in similar improper conduct in the future supports an award of substantial enhanced costs. It appears that this is the only way to discourage him from engaging in such behaviour in the future.\n[58] I also have difficulty with the portion of the Respondent\u2019s written submissions that begins with the sub-heading, \u201cThe CRA did not threaten a penalty\u201d.\n[59] The Respondent is responding to paragraphs 140 and 141 of my reasons for judgment. In paragraph 141, after noting in paragraph 140 that a witness for the Appellant had testified that the Appellant did not use its calculated percentage to calculate its input tax credits, but rather used the percentage mandated by the CRA, since the CRA had stated that it would impose penalties if the Appellant used its percentage, I stated the following:\nI am troubled by the CRA\u2019s conduct. The CRA should never threaten penalties to force a GST registrant to accept the CRA\u2019s allocation method. The law is clear: the CRA cannot simply substitute its approach for that of the Appellant, and there may be more than one method that is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The Appellant was proposing a methodology that it had developed after a substantial review of its operations. In such a situation, it is inconceivable that the Appellant\u2019s conduct met the standard for a gross negligence penalty. It appears that the CRA was using the threat of penalties to force the Appellant into accepting the CRA\u2019s 15.57%, the calculation of which was not explained to the Court and not explained to the Appellant.\n[60] At paragraph 33 of his written costs submissions, the Respondent appears to be challenging my finding of fact that the CRA threatened to impose gross negligence penalties. He states the following:\nAt trial, the Appellant\u2019s witness explained that they followed CRA percentages \u201cunder threat of penalty\u201d. The Court correctly observed that the CRA should never threaten penalties to force GST registrants to accept an allocation method. However, with respect, the Court\u2019s concern is misplaced. Whereas s. 280 of the Act provides for interest on unremitted Part IX amounts, older versions of s. 280 levied both interest and an automatic penalty calculated at 6% per year. The CRA regularly advises registrants of statutorily mandated interest and penalties in its correspondence, and the fact that it occurred here should have no impact on the costs analysis.\n[61] I have a number of concerns with respect to this paragraph in the Respondent\u2019s written submissions.\n[62] In the first instance, the actions of the CRA prior to the commencement of the litigation in this appeal are irrelevant for purposes of determining costs. This has led me to conclude that the only reason the Respondent is raising this issue is to, once again, challenge my factual findings when allowing the appeal.\n[63] A second concern relates to the references in paragraph 33 of the Respondent\u2019s submission to the CRA\u2019s administrative practice with respect to section 280. This is an attempt to introduce new evidence, after the conclusion of the hearing, to improperly challenge my factual findings at paragraphs 140 to 141 of my reasons for judgment.\n[64] What I find particularly troubling is that the Respondent based paragraph 33 of his written submissions on an incorrect factual assumption.\n[65] In paragraph 140 of my reasons for judgment I found that, as a result of the threat made by the CRA, the Appellant did not use its calculated percentage for the reporting periods ending between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. This means the CRA did not make the threat any earlier than March or April of 2010.\n[66] In paragraph 33 of his written submissions, the Respondent suggests that the CRA did not threaten to levy a gross negligence penalty but rather was advising the Appellant of the 6% penalty interest that was imposed on unremitted net tax under older versions of section 280. The 6% penalty interest was levied under subsection 280(1) of the GST Act.\n[67] Subsection 280(1) was amended effective April 1, 2007 to remove the 6% penalty interest. This amendment was announced in June 2006. In short, Parliament removed the 6% penalty interest at least three years before the CRA made the threat to impose penalties on the Appellant. Clearly, the CRA did make the threat in respect of the 6% penalty interest.\n[68] To summarize, the Respondent has improperly challenged a factual finding made in my reasons for judgment, the issue he refers to in his written submission is not relevant for purposes of my cost award, and he based his submission on alleged facts that are not on the record and are directly contradicted by the effective date of amendments to subsection 280(1) of the GST Act.\nConclusion\n[69] After considering all of the relevant factors, particularly the Respondent\u2019s improper conduct with respect to his delay in following the Court\u2019s decision in BC Ferries, his attempt at a trial by ambush and his written submissions that indicate that he may pursue this improper behavior in the future, I have concluded that the Respondent\u2019s conduct must be discouraged by a significant cost award. Therefore, I award the Appellant costs of 60% of its legal fees.\n[70] I have reviewed the Appellant\u2019s documents that support its request for $92,618.42 as reimbursements for disbursements. I have concluded that the Appellant is entitled to reimbursement for all noted disbursements.\n[71] The Appellant asked for non-recoverable HST equal to 6.14% of its counsel fees, plus disbursements. I have therefore used this percentage to determine my cost award in respect of non-recoverable HST.\n[72] For the forgoing reasons, the Appellant is awarded a single lump sum for costs and disbursements of $895,731.40, comprised of the following:\n-$751,296.60 in respect of legal fees of $1,252,161 (60% of ($1,217,161 plus $35,000))[15];\n-$92,618.42 in respect of disbursements; and\n-$51,816.38 in respect of non-recoverable HST (6.14% of ($751,296.60 plus $92,618.42).\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 26th day of April 2024.\n\u201cS.

MacPhee\u201d\nMacPhee J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 52\nDate: 20240426\nDocket: 2021-2767(GST)I\nBETWEEN:\nOTHNIEL DEFREITAS,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nMacPhee J.\n[1] In 2015 the appellant, Mr. Othniel Defreitas applied for a GST\/HST new housing rebate with respect to 3 Matthewson Avenue, Bradford, Ontario L3Z 0P3. The Minister of National Revenue (\u201cMinister\u201d) denied the rebate. Mr. Defreitas appealed the denial to the Tax Court. As part of the Notice of Reply, the respondent brought a preliminary motion to quash the appeal on the grounds that the preconditions for filing the appeal were not met. Specifically, the respondent submits that Mr. Defreitas failed to object to the assessment within the time limit for doing so, failed to apply for an extension of time to object within the time limit for doing so and is now out of time to make such an application. Since objecting to an assessment is a precondition to appealing the assessment to this Court, the respondent submits that the appeal should be quashed.\nI. ISSUE [2] At this point, the only issue before the Court is on what date was the Notice of Assessment (\u201cNOA\u201d) sent to Mr. Defreitas. The respondent argues that the NOA in question was mailed on April 1, 2015. Mr. Defreitas claims that the NOA was not sent out by the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) until May 18, 2021 when a CRA Collections officer provided him with a copy. The respondent admits that, if the NOA was first sent on the date put forth by the appellant, then Mr. Defreitas objected within time limits set out in the Excise Tax Act, RSC 1985, c. E-15 (\u201cAct\u201d) and the appeal should not be quashed. Thus, the only issue on this preliminary motion is when the NOA was sent.\nII. FACTS [3] On Dec 2, 2013 the appellant purchased a property located at 3 Matthewson Ave, Bradford Ont. Title was transferred to him on April 1, 2014.\n[4] On March 28, 2014 the appellant signed the GST\/HST new housing rebate application for houses purchased from a Builder. This application included his address at 3 Matthewson Ave.\n[5] In February 2015, the CRA audited the appellant.\n[6] On June 14, 2016 the appellant moved out of 3 Matthewson Ave.\n[7] On February 25, 2020 the appellant received a legal warning letter about a GST\/HST debt.\n[8] On August 4, 2021, the appellant electronically filed with the Minister a Notice of Objection to the Assessment.\n[9] The Minister considered the Notice of Objection filed on August 4, 2021, as an Application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection.\n[10] On October 15, 2021, the Minister denied the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection, because it was filed 2,227 days beyond the expiry of the timeframe for granting such extension pursuant to paragraph 303(7)(a) of the Act.\n[11] On November 9, 2021, the appellant filed an appeal to this Court with respect to the Assessment.\n[12] Some time in December 2020 the appellant hired Alexander Shaulov as his representative. Mr. Shaulov made inquiries with the CRA, including an Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) request.\n[13] Mr. Shaulov has concluded that the applicable NOA was not prepared by the CRA on April 1, 2015. This conclusion is in large part based upon his analysis of the information provided through his ATIP request.\n[14] The appellant and Mr. Shaulov both testified on his behalf. Mr. Anujan Kumaranathan, a CRA employee, testified for the respondent. An affidavit of CRA employee Wade Smith was also filed by the respondent.\n[15] I do not criticize the creditability of any witness who provided evidence in this matter. Each party attempted to be helpful and to provide answers to the questions asked. Yet, as will be analyzed below, the various witnesses ask me to make a finding of fact that is diametrically opposed. Specifically, the appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that the NOA was not sent until 2021, whereas the respondent\u2019s witnesses provides evidence that the NOA was mailed on April 1, 2015.\nIII. POSITION OF THE APPELLANT [16] Much of the appellant\u2019s evidence came through his representative, Mr. Shaulov. The following are the reasons the appellant argues that I should find that the NOA was not sent on April 1, 2015:\n(i) based upon Mr. Shaulov\u2019s review of the information provided through the ATIP request, the CRA did no more than create a draft NOA in April 2015; (ii) the CRA did not, until 2021, have Mr. Defreitas\u2019 SIN number or address. In effect, he argues that the CRA did not have sufficient records to assess the appellant in 2015; (iii) the appellant asks the Court to make an adverse inference based on the results of his ATIP request. This because, as a result of his ATIP request, he was only provided with a draft NOA. He relies upon section 30(2) of the Canada Evidence Act RSC 1985, C-5. in making this argument. This section reads as follows:\nInference where information not in business record\n(2) Where a record made in the usual and ordinary course of business does not contain information in respect of a matter the occurrence or existence of which might reasonably be expected to be recorded in that record, the court may on production of the record admit the record for the purpose of establishing that fact and may draw the inference that the matter did not occur or exist.\nIV. POSITION OF THE RESPONDENT [17] The respondent submits that an assessment is deemed to have been made on the day it was sent and received by the recipient on the day it was mailed.[1]\n[18] The respondent emphasizes that the appellant must do more than simply assert that he did not receive the NOA in April 2015. Credible evidence must be lead to support this position.\n[19] In an analysis of the appellant\u2019s creditability, the respondent relies upon the following. First, the appellant has not filed taxes since 2003, describing the appellant as someone that \u201chas shown a history of disregard towards his tax obligations under various taxation statues\u201d.[2] Therefore, the lack of a duly filed objection cannot be taken as an inference that the NOA was not received by the appellant. The respondent submits that it is far from certain that the appellant would have objected to the NOA if he received it in 2015.\n[20] The respondent further points out that appellant has testified that he felt he was entitled to and assured of the rebate in issue. The respondent argues that it is reasonable to conclude appellant received the NOA on April 1, 2015 but took no action.\n[21] Furthermore, the respondent argues that if I do find the appellant has provided evidence to create doubt as to whether the appellant received the NOA, the respondent has brought sufficient evidence to show, on the balance of probabilities, that CRA mailed the NOA on April 1, 2015. The respondent relies upon the evidence of its two witnesses in support of this assertion.\nV. ANALYSIS [22] Both sides correctly state that my analysis should rely upon DaSilva v Her Majesty the Queen, 2018 TCC 74.\n[23] DaSilva reproduced the four-step test to be applied when a taxpayer alleges that a NOA issued under the Act was never mailed.\n(1) Step 1 [24] Under Step 1, the taxpayer must assert that the NOA was not sent by the Minister, either by asserting that (1) he or she did not receive the NOA and thus believes that it was not mailed, or (2) it was mailed to the wrong address through no fault of his or her own.[3]\n[25] The Federal Court of Appeal has made it clear that if the taxpayer\u2019s assertion at Step 1 is not credible, there is no need to proceed further.[4]\n[26] The appellant does not allege that the NOA was mailed to the wrong address, as he testified that he was living at the Rebate Property at the time of the Assessment. Instead, the appellant alleges that the NOA had not been mailed at all in April, 2015.\n[27] In support of this assertion, the appellant has merely testified that the NOA was not received. He is an individual who had not filed tax returns since 2003. He therefore does not appear to be a person diligent in dealing with his tax filings.\n[28] The appellant has almost certainly not discharged his burden to credibly assert that the NOA was not received. He has simply made an assertion that he did not receive the NOA that was alleged to have been mailed on or around April 1, 2015. I would allow the Crown\u2019s motion on this basis. Nevertheless, I will also analyze the other steps set out in DaSilva.\n(2) Step 2 [29] Under Step 2 of the test, if the Court finds that the appellant discharged his burden to credibly assert that the NOA was not sent by the Minister, the respondent bears the burden to introduce sufficient evidence to prove that the NOA was indeed sent. The standard of proof is balance of probabilities.[5]\n[30] The respondent submits that it has met its burden to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the NOA was sent on April 1, 2015.\n[31] In their written submissions at paragraph 27, the respondent has properly described their evidence as such:\nThe Respondent tendered three affidavits from two CRA officers to demonstrate that the Assessment was mailed on April 1, 2015. The Affidavit of Anujan Kumaranathan affirmed on September 14, 2023 sets out that the Assessment was released in the CRA\u2019s Business Client Communication System (\u201cBCCS\u201d) cycle 000006840, which ran on March 28, 2015 with a notice date of April 1, 2015.[6] The Affidavit of Wade Smith, Manager for the Print to Mail Division located in the Prince Edward Island Taxation Centre of the Canada Revenue Agency, sworn on September 12, 2023 sets out that BCCS cycle 000006840 was printed and mailed on time.[7] The Affidavit of Anujan Kumaranathan affirmed on September 7, 2023 sets out that he was unable to find that a Notice of Objection to the Assessment was received by the CRA on or before June 30, 2015, or an application to extend the time to file a Notice of Objection was received by the CRA on or before June 30, 2016. As such, the Respondent submits it has discharged its burden to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the Assessment was sent.[8]\n[32] Mr. Kumaranathan appeared in court and was cross examined.\n[33] The appellant argues that the Court should not accept the respondent\u2019s evidence; on the basis that neither Mr. Kumaranathan nor Mr. Smith had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the mailing of the NOA. The appellant argues that the affidavits of Mr. Smith and Mr. Kumaranathan lack detail, and Mr. Smith at least in part relies upon information conveyed to him by others. He states the affidavits are based on a standard form and are not produced in the most accurate and diligent manner. Therefore I should place no weight on their evidence\n[34] I disagree with the appellant\u2019s analysis. While my preference would be that Mr. Smith, in his affidavit, advised as to when he began to work for the CRA, yet this is not a sufficient basis to dismiss his evidence. In all other respects, I find the evidence of the respondent contains the information I am seeking to reach judgement. I therefore find that the appellant fails on this second step. I find that, on the balance of probabilities, the NOA was sent to the appellant, at 3 Matthewson Ave. on April 1, 2015.\n(3) Step 3 [35] Given that I have found that the respondent has discharged his burden to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the NOA was mailed on April 1, 2015, then the NOA is deemed to have been received by the appellant on April 1, 2015. However, Step 3 of the test provides that the appellant may nonetheless introduce evidence to rebut this presumption and prove that the NOA was actually sent on a different date.[9]\n[36] As noted, the appellant in large part relies upon notes and documents obtained in the ATIP request, to infer that the NOA was not prepared in April 2015.\n[37] I do not find the evidence lead by the appellant rebuts the presumption found in step 2. The inferences I am asked to draw by the appellant, including that the NOA was backdated, are not reasonably drawn from the evidence lead.\n[38] By way of example, the appellant relies upon a notation in the memo to file prepared by the CRA auditor on 2015-03-26 which states sent file for review as evidence that a NOA was not prepared on April 1, 2015. [10] I do not interpret this entry in the same way. This comment is so brief and lacking in context that I see no evidentiary value to it.\n[39] The appellant also alleges that the Minister\u2019s lack of accurate records concerning the appellant\u2019s social insurance number and the appellant\u2019s address meant that the Minister could not have sent the NOA to the appellant in 2015. This argument is based on a faulty assumption, as it fails to consider that the appellant applied for the Rebate and set out the address of the Rebate Property in the application form. I have no doubt that the Minister had the appellant\u2019s 3 Matthewson Avenue, Bradford, Ontario address in 2015. The address is in fact included in the memo to file relied upon by the appellant.\n[40] Next, the appellant emphasizes that the ATIP records included a draft NOA. Therefore, the NOA claimed to have been mailed does not exist and could not have been sent on April 1, 2015. It is my finding that the existence of a draft NOA is not demonstrative of the non-existence of a finalized NOA. The draft NOA is otherwise the same as the mailed NOA save for the watermark \u201cDraft\u201d. On this topic, this Court prefers the evidence tendered by the two CRA officers to the negative inference that the appellant asks this Court to draw from the draft assessment in the ATIP package.\n[41] Finally, the appellant asks me to make an adverse inference based on the results of the aforementioned ATIP request. This once again refers to the fact that the response to the ATIP request only provided a draft NOA. He relies upon section 30(2) of the Evidence Act in making this argument.\n[42] His argument relies upon an incorrect interpretation of section 30(2) of the Canada Evidence Act. The appellant is referencing records provided by an ATIP request in seeking an adverse inference. Even if I were to apply 30(2), the section uses the words may make an adverse inference. Given the evidence I have been provided in this case, I will not make the requested adverse inference.\n[43] Accordingly, the appellant has not been able to put forth sufficient documentary evidence or testimony to rebut the presumption that the NOA was sent on April 1, 2015, as established in Step 2 of the test.\n(4) Step 4 [44] Step 4 of the test sets out that a NOA is deemed to have been made on the date established in either step 2 or 3 and received by the recipient on the same day.[11]\n[45] Based upon the above analysis, I find that the NOA was received by the appellant on the day it was mailed, April 1, 2015. A notice of objection to the assessment was not filed by the appellant pursuant to the requirements of the Act.\n[46] As no valid objection has been filed by the appellant within the timelines set out in the Act, therefore a precondition set out in s.306 of the Act to appealing the assessment has not been met. The appeal is therefore quashed.\n[47] Each party shall be responsible for their own costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of April, 2024.\n\u201cR.

Introduction: [1] The Respondent Crown has brought a motion to quash this appeal, on the basis that the relief sought by the Appellant, Mr. Scott Gillies, is not within the jurisdiction of this Court.\n[2] Mr. Gillies seeks a decision of this Court in respect of his 2016 and 2017 taxation years that he is not responsible to the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) for tax under the Income Tax Act (Act) that his then employer, Love That River Inc. (LTRI), withheld from income paid to him qua employee, but did not remit to the Minister.\nII. Background: [3] In the Respondent\u2019s Reply, the Attorney General of Canada pleads that the Respondent\u2019s \u201c\u2026preliminary objection\u2026 [is that]\u2026insofar as the [a]ppellant seeks to appeal the income tax assessed on the assessment for 2016 and 2017 taxation years, no remedy lies to this Honourable Court with respect of [sic] tax properly owing under the Act.\u201d[1]\n[4] According to the Reply, LTRC filed amended T4s for the 2016 and 2017 taxation years indicating that no tax had been withheld for either said year.[2]\n[5] Also, per the Reply, the Appellant had reported income tax deducted for 2016 in the amount of $54,900 which in reassessing, the Minister reduced to $49,844. Similarly, for 2017 income tax deducted was reported by the Appellant as being $28,063, which on reassessing, the Minister reduced to $19,744.[3]\n[6] Mr. Gillies testified also that subsequently LTRI argued that he had not been an employee, but rather had been an independent contractor and therefore responsible himself for his remittances to the Minister of required withholdings.\n[7] This assertion by LTRI was rejected by a decision of the Minister. That decision is reflected in a letter to Mr. Gillies from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) on behalf of the Minister, said to have been mailed December 21, 2017 (Ex. A-1). The letter informed that the Minister upheld a September 27, 2017 ruling under the Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance Act that the Appellant\u2019s relationship with LTRC had met the requirements of a contract of service and that accordingly an employer-employee relationship had existed between LTRC as employer and the Appellant as employee.\n[8] As stated, the Appellant\u2019s continuing concern is that the Minister not look to him for collection of the tax for his 2016 and 2017 taxation years LTRC had withheld but not remitted. He testified that he had negotiated an agreement with LRTC that in return for payment of an agreed sum for constructive dismissal, he would not sue LRTC for the un-remitted withholdings.\n[9] I asked Mr. Gillies why he had brought this matter to the Tax Court of Canada. His answer was to point to the above-mentioned letter (Ex. A-1) from CRA on behalf of the Minister sent December 21, 2017. It stated that if he disagreed with the decision that he had been an employee of LTRC then he \u201ccan appeal to the Tax Court of Canada\u2026\u201d Of course, he is quite satisfied with that decision of the Minister. In this proceeding, he is seeking a quite different decision.\nIII. Analysis: [10] With this background, I now return to the above-referenced motion of the Respondent Crown to quash this proceeding. In the Reply, the Attorney General asserts that this Court has no jurisdiction \u201cto relieve the [a]ppellant from the obligation to pay tax which he is liable for, pursuant to section 222 of the Act\u201d.[4]\n[11] Also in the Reply, the Attorney General, \u201cadmits the employer is responsible to [sic] remitting to the Minister any tax withholdings from employees\u201d, and as well \u201cadmits the employer did not remit any tax withheld from the Appellant\u2019s income\u201d.[5]\n[12] In arguing that this proceeding should be quashed, Respondent\u2019s counsel cited Boucher v. Her Majesty, 2004 FCA 47, which followed the earlier Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decision of Neuhaus v. Canada, [2003] 2 C.T.C. 177, 2003 D.T.C. 5469 in which per Noel, J. as he then was stated (paragraphs 4-6):\n4. In this case, the applicant is not seeking to have stated the disputed assessments vacated or varied. Rather, she is claiming that the taxes as assessed by the Minister have already been paid by way of a deduction at source (see subsection 227(9.4) [of the Act], which inter alia makes the employer liable for the taxes owing by an employee up to and including the amounts deducted from the salary and not remitted). In these circumstances, the [Tax Court] judge below rightly held that she did not have jurisdiction and it was therefore wrong for her to consider the dispute on its merits.\n5. The problem raised by the applicant is a collection problem. In this regard, section 222 [of the Act] assigns jurisdiction to the Federal Court in these words:\nAll taxes, interest, penalties, costs and other amounts payable under this Act are debts due to Her Majesty and recoverable as such in the Federal Court...\n6. Insofar as the applicant claims to have already paid the taxes being claimed from her, she may assert her rights in the Federal Court when the Minister attempts to recover the sums he considers payable\u2026\n[13] In 2004, section 222 of the Act was revised as subsection 222(2), headed \u201cDebts to Her Majesty\u201d, and providing:\nA tax debt is a debt due to Her Majesty and is recoverable as such in the Federal Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction or in any other manner provided by this Act.\n[14] In Boucher, the FCA approvingly cited at paragraph 8 the same above paragraphs from Neuhaus. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Boucher decision, rendered by a panel per Sharlow J.A., read:\n10. \u2026Parliament has not empowered the Tax Court to determine a dispute as to whether or not tax has been withheld at source from particular payments.\n11. The only possible remedy is to allow this appeal [to the FCA], set aside the judgment of the Tax Court and replace it with a judgment quashing the Tax Court appeal\u2026\n[15] In Reese McIntosh v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2011 TCC 147, my colleague Justice D\u2019Arcy considered a somewhat similar situation. He concluded, at paragraphs 19 \u2013 21 that,\n19. It is clear\u2026that the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to appeals from an assessment. It is only appeals from an assessment that arise under the Act (see the comments of Rip J. (as he then was) in McMillen Holdings Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue, 87 DTC 585, at pages 591-592).\n20. Under subsection 152(1) of the Act, the Minister is required to assess the tax payable for the year under the Act. I agree with counsel for the Respondent that subsection 152(1) of the Act does not provide for calculating \u201ctax owing\u201d after source deductions and therefore this Court does not have jurisdiction to credit the Appellant for the alleged greater amount of income tax source deductions.\n21. My conclusion is consistent with the decision of this Court in Liu v. Her Majesty the Queen [1985] 2 C.T.C. 2971\u2026and the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Neuhaus v. R\u2026.\nIV. Conclusion: [16] I will issue judgment quashing this appeal, on the basis that this Court is without jurisdiction to address the matter of an employer withholding but not remitting tax payable under the Act, which is \u201ca collection problem\u201d falling within subsection 222(2) of the Income Tax Act, which assigns jurisdiction to the Federal Court. There will be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of April 2024.\n\u201cB.

Russell\u201d\nRussell J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 55\nDate: 20240430\nDocket: 2022-503(IT)I\nBETWEEN:\nGEORGIA MITROU,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nRussell J.\n[1] The Appellant, Ms. Mitrou, by notice of appeal filed February 24, 2022, seeks to appeal reassessments raised under the federal Income Tax Act (Act) pertaining to her 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years. Each of these four reassessments was raised (sent) August 24, 2006.\n[2] The Respondent Crown has moved to quash this appeal on the basis that no notice of objection was served on a timely basis regarding the subject reassessments. Subsection 169(1) of the Act requires that for a taxpayer to appeal to this Court an assessment or reassessment, the taxpayer must have served a notice of objection pertaining to that assessment or reassessment under section 165.\n[3] Subsection 165(1) of the Act provides that for a taxpayer that is an individual other than a trust, the notice of objection, to be valid, must have been served on or before the later of (1) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year (i.e. April 30, 2001; April 30, 2002; April 30, 2003 and April 30, 2004 for the subject reassessed years), and (2) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment (i.e., 90 days after August 24, 2006 - which was Wednesday, November 22, 2006).\n[4] Also, paragraph 166.1(7)(a) of the Act provides that an individual has a year following the above latest date for serving a notice of objection, in which to apply for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection. Thus, as November 22, 2006 was the latest date per subsection 165(1) for Ms. Mitrou to have served a notice of objection, November 22, 2007 was the last date for her to apply for an extension of time to serve a notice of objection.\n[5] At the hearing of this matter, the affidavit of Peter Gabris, sworn April 8, 2024, was entered as Ex. R-1 per subsection 244(9) of the Act. Mr. Gabris is a litigation officer of Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). In his affidavit, Mr. Gabris attests that he examined the relevant records of CRA as to what was filed or served, or not, in connection with these reassessments raised August 24, 2006. At paragraph 10 of the affidavit he attests that on December 10, 2021 the Appellant filed with the Minister \u201ca purported electronic Notice of Objection to the [subject] reassessments.\u201d\n[6] Thus, the affidavit discloses that on December 10, 2021 a notice of objection was served. That date was more than fifteen years beyond the last date (November 22, 2006) for timely serving of a notice of objection and fourteen years beyond the last date (November 22, 2007) for seeking an extension of time for timely serving of the notice of objection.\n[7] Paragraph 11 of the Gabris affidavit reads:\n11. On January 18, 2022, the Minister considered the December 10, 2021 purported electronic Notice of Objection and informed the Appellant that the objection could not be accepted, pursuant to subsection 165(1) of the Income Tax Act, as it was not filed within 90 days from the date of the reassessments. The Minister further informed the Appellant that an application for an extension of time to file the Notice of Objection could not be granted, pursuant to subsection 166.1(7), as the request for an extension must be made within one year of the due date for filing the objection. Attached as Exhibit \u201cC\u201d is a copy of the January 18, 2022 letter.\n[8] Thus, I am obliged to find that Ms. Mitrou is considerably beyond any final date for serving or applying to serve a notice of objection pertaining to any of the subject reassessments of her 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years.\n[9] That being the case, we are left with a notice of appeal that is invalid due to subsection 169(1) of the Act which specifies that for a taxpayer to appeal any assessment or reassessment to this Court, the taxpayer first must have validly served a notice of objection pertaining to that assessment or reassessment.\n[10] As no notice of objection has been validly served, I must quash Ms. Mitrou\u2019s herein appeal of the subject reassessments for her 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of April 2024.\n\u201cB.

CONTEXT\n[1] Mr. Peter T. Schroeder has appealed to this Court the assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue under the Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th supp.), as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d)) in respect of his 2021 taxation year.\n[2] In filing his income tax return for that year, Mr. Schroeder claimed a deduction of $22,000 under paragraph 8(1)(c) of the Act, referred to as the \u201cClergy Residence Deduction,\u201d which deduction was denied on the basis that Mr. Schroeder did not earn any income from an office or employment during the 2021 taxation year.\n[3] Furthermore, the Minister stated that Mr. Schroeder did not provide to the Canada Revenue Agency the prescribed Clergy Residence Deduction Form T1223 (the \u201cForm T1223\u201d) as required by subsection 8(10) of the Act, which is a prerequisite for the deduction.\n[4] At the hearing, Mr. Schroeder represented himself. His testimony was credible and reliable. The Respondent did not call any witnesses.\n[5] All statutory references that follow in these reasons are to the Act unless otherwise stated.\nII. LAW\n[6] The relevant part of paragraph 8(1)(c) reads as follows:\n8 (1) In computing a taxpayer\u2019s income for a taxation year from an office or employment, there may be deducted such of the following amounts as are wholly applicable to that source or such part of the following amounts as may reasonably be regarded as applicable thereto\n[\u2026]\n(c) where, in the year, the taxpayer\n(i) is a member of the clergy or of a religious order or a regular minister of a religious denomination, and\n(ii) is\n(A) in charge of a diocese, parish or congregation,\n(B) ministering to a diocese, parish or congregation, or\n(C) engaged exclusively in full-time administrative service by appointment of a religious order or religious denomination,\nthe amount, not exceeding the taxpayer\u2019s remuneration for the year from the office or employment, equal to\n[\u2026]\n[Emphasis added.]\nIII. FACTS\n[7] Mr. Schroeder is a certified and ordained clergyman. He obtained an undergraduate degree from the University of Alberta, a Master of Divinity from the North American Baptist Divinity School, and a Doctorate of Ministry from the North American Baptist Seminary (in 1992) and was ordained in the North American Baptist Denomination in 1983 (see Exhibits A-1, A-2 and A-3).\n[8] After serving his parish for more than 40 years, Mr. Schroeder resigned in April 2020 from his position as a clergyman and lead pastor at the Kelowna Trinity Baptist Church (the \u201cChurch\u201d).\n[9] Following his resignation, Mr. Schroeder approached the Kelowna Trinity Baptist Church Legacy Foundation (the \u201cFoundation\u201d) to inquire as to whether the Foundation would be interested in funding him to provide chaplaincy services to Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the \u201cRCMP\u201d) members and personnel in the Kelowna area.\n[10] After an informal meeting with the directors of the Foundation, the Foundation agreed to pay him directly for his chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel. Mr. Schroeder, under the name \u201cTim Schroeder National Ministry TS67\u201d, and the Foundation concluded an Agency Agreement formalizing the arrangement, commencing on April 15, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2021 (the \u201cAgency Agreement\u201d) (see Exhibit A-8).\n[11] As indicated in a letter dated November 7, 2023 from B.D. \u201cBrad\u201d Haugli, the Chief Superintendent, RCMP \u2013 District Commander \u2013 Southeast District, Mr. Schroeder, as Chaplain, \u201c\u2026 provides both strategic preventative wellness engagement with our members and responsive assistance during those times our members experience traumatic incidents\u201d (see Exhibit A-4). According to that same letter, and as Mr. Schroeder testified at the hearing, Mr. Schroeder provides these services throughout a large region of Southeastern British Columbia for some 110 hours per month, through the sponsorship of the Foundation. This large region includes four RCMP districts.\n[12] Mr. Schroeder testified that, in Kelowna, he was the sole paid Chaplain for over 300 RCMP members and personnel. Seven volunteer Chaplains also provided chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel.\n[13] During a typical week, Mr. Schroeder testified that he would attend a briefing in Kelowna, followed by a meeting with the Chief Superintendent of the Southeast district. When distressing and disastrous events occurred, he would attend specific locations to offer support to RCMP members and personnel.\n[14] The RCMP would pay Mr. Schroeder\u2019s \u201chard costs\u201d, including his meals, travel arrangements and a per diem. The Foundation would pay for his cell phone. Furthermore, the Foundation would reimburse him when he incurred expenses, including when he bought some Chaplain\u2019s jackets for the volunteer Chaplains and himself. Mr. Schroeder used his personal vehicle to travel between the various locations where he would provide chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel.\n[15] During the 2021 taxation year, the Foundation paid Mr. Schroeder twice monthly. Mr. Schroeder received a total amount of $66,000 (that is, $2,750 x 24) from the Foundation in the 2021 taxation year (see Exhibit A-9), which he reported as \u201cself-employed professional income.\u201d Mr. Schroeder claimed a deduction for the use of his personal vehicle as a business expense for income tax purposes. Mr. Schroeder also reported pension income totalling $21,949. However, during the 2021 taxation year, Mr. Schroeder did not report any income from an office or employment.\n[16] Mr. Schroeder testified that he would meet \u201cat least quarterly\u201d with members of the Foundation to apprise them of his activities.\nIV. ISSUE\n[17] The sole issue in this appeal is whether the income received by Mr. Schroeder from the Foundation during the 2021 taxation year is remuneration from an \u201coffice or employment,\u201d such that Mr. Schroeder would be entitled to the Clergy Residence Deduction under paragraph 8(1)(c) totalling $22,000.\n[18] In the course of the hearing, the Respondent conceded that Mr. Schroeder duly submitted Form T1223 to the Canada Revenue Agency (see Exhibit A-7). Furthermore, the Respondent indicated to the Court that there was no issue as to the status and function of Mr. Schroeder as referred to in subparagraphs 8(1)(c)(i) and (ii), and that there was no issue as to the quantum of any amount received by Mr. Schroeder during the 2021 taxation year as income from the Foundation, or as to the amount of the claimed Clergy Residence Deduction.\nV. CONCLUSION\n[19] For the reasons below, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Schroeder is an employee of the Foundation and has thus received remuneration from an employment from the Foundation during the 2021 taxation year. The appeal is therefore allowed, without costs, and Mr. Schroeder is entitled to the Clergy Residence Deduction totalling $22,000 under paragraph 8(1)(c).\nVI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES\n[20] Mr. Schroeder submits that he is entitled to the Clergy Residence Deduction, as the income he received from the Foundation is remuneration from \u201cemployment\u201d. According to Mr. Schroeder, when the relevant factors are applied to the relationship between the Foundation and himself, they show that he is an employee of the Foundation and not an independent contractor. He performed the same or similar duties under the Agency Agreement that he performed as pastor at the Church and should therefore be considered an employee. In the alternative, Mr. Schroeder submits that the income he received from the Foundation is remuneration from an \u201coffice\u201d, entitling him to the Clergy Residence Deduction.\n[21] The Respondent submits that Mr. Schroeder is not entitled to the Clergy Residence Deduction, as he did not earn any remuneration from an \u201coffice or employment\u201d during the 2021 taxation year. The Respondent argues that the subjective intent and the objective reality of the relationship between the Foundation and Mr. Schroeder was that Mr. Schroeder was an independent contractor and not an employee of the Foundation.\nVII. ANALYSIS\n[22] As indicated above, in the present appeal, both the status test (subparagraph 8(1)(c)(i)) and the function test (subparagraph 8(1)(c)(ii)) are met. The sole issue in this appeal is to determine whether the income Mr. Schroeder received from the Foundation is remuneration from an office or employment, or whether he received that income in his capacity as an independent contractor (or as professional income).\n[23] In order to determine whether a person is an employee engaged in a contract of service or an independent contractor engaged in a contract for services, this Court has to ascertain the whole relationship between the parties (Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1986] 3 F.C. 553 [Wiebe Door]).\n[24] The central question will be to determine \u201cwhether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business on his own account\u201d (671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 SCC 59 at para 47 [Sagaz]).\n[25] In Sagaz, above, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the approach taken by the Federal Court of Appeal in Wiebe Door, above, where Justice MacGuigan referred to the various factors, which have to be taken into account to make that determination, and summarized the relevant principles as follows:\n[47] . . . In making this determination, the level of control the employer has over the worker\u2019s activities will always be a factor. However, other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her own equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the degree of financial risk taken by the worker, the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker, and the worker\u2019s opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks.\n[48] It bears repeating that the above factors constitute a non-exhaustive list, and there is no set formula as to their application. The relative weight of each will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the case.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[26] In addressing the central question, namely \u201cwhether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business on his own account\u201d, the Federal Court of Appeal in 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 85 [Connor Homes] (at para 39 and following) established a two-step approach to be followed.\n[27] The first step consists of ascertaining the subjective intent of the parties to the relationship. To determine the subjective intent of the parties, one should examine the written contract between the parties, as well as the actual behaviour of the parties, such as invoices for services rendered, registration for sales taxes purposes, and income tax returns filed as an independent contractor.\n[28] The second step consists of determining whether the objective reality of the situation sustains the subjective intent of the parties. The various factors outlined in Wiebe Door, above, then become relevant to ascertain whether the facts of the situation are consistent with the subjective intent of the parties. As indicated in Connor Homes, \u201c[i]n other words, the subjective intent of the parties cannot trump the reality of the relationship as ascertained through objective facts. In this second step, the parties intent as well as the terms of the contract may also be taken into account since they colors [sic] the relationship\u201d (para 40).\n[29] Furthermore, in applying the test, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that the first step should always be to determine the intent of the parties, and then, \u201c\u2026 using the prism of that intent, determining in a second step whether the parties\u2019 relationship, as reflected in objective reality, is one of employer-employee or of independent contractor\u201d (see Connor Homes, at para 42).\nA. The first step: the subjective intent of the parties\n[30] For the following reasons, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Schroeder and the Foundation\u2019s subjective intention was for their relationship to be one of employee\/employer.\n[31] Although the evidence showed that Mr. Schroeder reported his income from the Foundation as self-employment income, and deducted expenses for the use of his personal vehicle, I note that Form T1223 was signed by the executive director of the Foundation as \u201cemployer\u201d. I also take into account the fact that Mr. Schroeder did not issue any invoices to the Foundation for services rendered to RCMP members and personnel.\n[32] During the hearing, the Respondent referred to various provisions of the Agency Agreement between the Foundation and Mr. Schroeder to support the view that Mr. Schroeder was an independent contractor and not an employee of the Foundation. For example, section 10 of the Agency Agreement, which provides that \u201cTim Schroeder National Ministry representative will be responsible for any reporting requirements of payroll, GST or any other statutory requirements for funds expended in this ministry\u201d. The Agency Agreement also contains a disposition releasing the Foundation from any liability and expenses in connection with personal injury arising from his work.\n[33] However, the Agency Agreement also contains various provisions, which show that the Foundation controls various aspects of the activities undertaken by Mr. Schroeder. Pursuant to the Agency Agreement, Mr. Schroeder, acting as an agent, was to advance the charitable goals of the Foundation by providing ministry services to RCMP members and personnel. Section 3 of the Agency Agreement provides that written progress reports will be supplied to the Foundation every six months, and the Foundation reserves the right to inspect the project. Further, it is clear from the wording of the Agency Agreement that the Foundation was overseeing Mr. Schroeder\u2019s work.\n[34] This type of agency agreement is usually entered into by charities to make sure they are complying with requirements of the Act to carry out their own charitable activities when agents are hired to carry on a project of the charity outside of Canada.\n[35] Although Mr. Schroeder, as Tim Schroeder National Minister TS67, and the Foundation entered into such an agreement, I give limited weight to the Agency Agreement in my analysis understanding the purpose of this kind of agreement.\nB. The second step: the objective reality of the relationship\n[36] Under the second step, I have to ascertain whether in reality, after taking into consideration all the relevant factors, the relationship of the parties was the one that they intended it to be.\n[37] For the following reasons, after weighing all the relevant factors, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, Mr. Schroeder was an employee of the Foundation and thus, he received remuneration from employment from the Foundation during the 2021 taxation year.\n[38] In the present appeal, I find that the relevant factors to consider are the level of control the Foundation had over Mr. Schroeder\u2019s activities; whether Mr. Schroeder provided his own equipment; whether Mr. Schroeder had a chance of profit in the performance of his tasks while providing chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel; and whether Mr. Schroeder managed and assumed financial risks while providing services to RCMP members and personnel.\n(1) Level of control\n[39] The Foundation did not control Mr. Schroeder\u2019s schedule or day-to-day work, and did not control his activities. Mr. Schroeder did not submit time logs detailing the specific activities that he undertook. Mr. Schroeder was also free to provide his services in the manner of his choosing.\n[40] The reporting requirements to the Foundation were minimal. The Respondent tendered into evidence a 6-month project review provided by Mr. Schroeder to the Foundation, which only provides a brief overview of Mr. Schroeder\u2019s activities (see Exhibit R-1, \u201cRespondent\u2019s Book of Documents - Tab 2 - Six Month Project Review Report\u201d).\n[41] However, Mr. Schroeder had to provide 110 hours per month of chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel, and was directed to specific locations to provide chaplaincy services by the RCMP. I assumed that after the meeting with the RCMP Chief Superintendent, Mr. Schroeder would go where his chaplaincy services were necessary and valued.\n[42] Although the above facts show limited control over Mr. Schroeder\u2019s activities and day-to-day work by the Foundation, I find that this factor indicates an employee-employer relationship between Mr. Schroeder and the Foundation. As Mr. Schroeder was employed by the Foundation to provide professional and confidential chaplaincy services, it is understandable that the Foundation would exercise less control over his activities than those of a typical employee.\n[43] In assessing this factor, I took into account the fact that Mr. Schroeder had to provide chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel for 110 hours per month, and that he would have to offer his services wherever the RCMP sent him. I also considered the fact that he had to report to the Foundation and had to conduct himself in such a way that fulfilled the Foundation\u2019s purpose. These reporting and conduct requirements show that the Foundation had control or the ability to exercise control over Mr. Schroeder\u2019s activities.\n(2) Equipment\n[44] Mr. Schroeder testified that he used his personal vehicle to travel between various RCMP locations. He also used his personal email address and cellphone for communications in the course of his activities. Mr. Schroeder testified that the Foundation reimbursed him for other tools that he required in the course of his duties, and gave as an example the Chaplain jackets he bought for all Chaplains providing chaplaincy services to the RCMP.\n[45] The use of one\u2019s own tools to provide services is an indicator that that person is providing services as an independent contractor (Sagaz, at para 47). More specifically, the use of a personal vehicle for work-related activities is also an indication that the individual is an independent contractor (Connor Homes, at para 50).\n[46] Considering the limited number of tools required to provide chaplaincy services, but considering the fact that Mr. Schroeder used his personal vehicle to provide chaplaincy services to RCMP members and personnel, I find that this factor supports the conclusion that Mr. Schroeder was an independent contractor.\n(3) Chance of profit and risk of loss\n[47] If a worker can increase the amount of money that they make by working efficiently to complete more projects, they have a chance of profit. The more a worker has a chance of profit, the more this indicates that the worker is an independent contractor (see AE Hospitality Ltd. v. M.N.R., 2019 TCC 116 at para 150, aff\u2019d 2020 FCA 207). The risk factor pertains to the financial risk assumed by the individual in providing their services. These factors are to be understood in an entrepreneurial sense (see 627148 Ontario Limited (Daily Care Health Services) v. M.N.R., 2013 TCC 169, at para 27).\n[48] Mr. Schroeder testified that he approached the Foundation following his resignation from the Church to set up the arrangement, which eventually led to the Agency Agreement. The Respondent argued that this indicates that he took a risk in establishing the arrangement. I do not agree.\n[49] Mr. Schroeder is paid by the Foundation twice monthly. The evidence did not show that he had to submit time logs or past-schedules in order to be paid. Mr. Schroeder testified that he was supposed to work 110 hours per month, but often worked additional hours. Also, there was no indication that Mr. Schroeder could complete the project provided in the Agency Agreement faster and subsequently profit from that rapid completion.\n[50] My review of the evidence brings me to conclude that Mr. Schroeder had no chance of profit when he was providing his services as a chaplain to RCMP members and personnel. Further, the evidence showed that while providing his services, Mr. Schroeder did not assume any financial risk. I therefore find that the profit and risk factors support the conclusion that Mr. Schroeder was an employee of the Foundation.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 2nd day of May 2024.\n\u201cDominique Lafleur\u201d\nLafleur J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 56\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2023-1618(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nPETER T SCHROEDER v.

Visser\u201d\nVisser J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 57\nDate: 20240503\nDocket: 2011-269(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nBRIAN MORTON HARTMAN,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR ORDER\nVisser J.\n[1] The Appellant, Brian Morton Hartman, is one of over 700 taxpayers (the \u201cRed Mile Investors\u201d) who invested in certain limited partnerships commonly referred to as the \u201cRed Mile\u201d partnerships in the years 2005-2009. Mr. Hartman was reassessed by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) by way of Notice of Reassessment dated June 9, 2010 in respect of his 2006 taxation year, pursuant to which the Minister disallowed Mr. Hartman\u2019s claim to $18,810 in limited partnership losses and $37,345 in CDE deductions.[1] Mr. Hartman filed his Notice of Appeal with the Court on January 25, 2011.\n[2] Mr. Hartman\u2019s appeal is a lead case for many of the other Red Mile Investors who have agreed to be bound by the outcome of his appeal. There are also a substantial number of Red Mile Investors who have not agreed to be bound by the lead case. Many of the related appeals are still at the CRA objections stage. While there is some ambiguity as to the total number of related objections and appeals, the Respondent has previously estimated that Red Mile Investors have filed 1093 Notices of Objection, of which 879 signed test case agreements.[2]\n[3] The Red Mile Investors were previously the subject of six applications by the Respondent under section 174 of the Income Tax Act[3] seeking to bind all of the various Red Mile Investors to the Court\u2019s determination of one or more common questions (the \u201cCommon Questions\u201d). The Respondent subsequently withdrew the section 174 applications following the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (National Revenue) v. Boguski, 2021 FCA 118.\n[4] This motion, brought by the Appellant, relates to the pre-trial production by the Respondent of various documents (the \u201cCRP Materials\u201d) which the Appellant argues are relevant to the determination of the Common Questions and the outcome of the Appellant\u2019s lead case appeal. In his Amended Notice of Motion, Mr. Hartman requests an order, under section 88 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d), that:[4]\n1. the Respondent list and disclose all relevant documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power relating to the purpose, intention, meaning, or interpretation of the definition of the term \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), including:\n(a) a complete and unredacted copy of the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) memorandum (the \u201cCRA Memorandum\u201d) by Roy Shultis dated on or about September 9, 1997;\n(b) copies of all documents, communications, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power that relate to the exchange between the CRA and the Department of Finance over the purpose, intention, meaning, or interpretation of subsection 66(15) of the Act; and\n(c) copies of any other documents, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power from January 1, 1996 that concern the purpose, intention, meaning, or interpretation of the amendments to the definition of the term \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act.\n[5] For the reasons that follow, it is my view that the Appellant\u2019s motion should be allowed in part.\nBACKGROUND FACTS\n[6] The facts in this motion are generally not in dispute. The parties jointly submitted a letter dated September 13, 2022 in which they advised the following:[5]\nWe wish to advise that the parties have agreed to the following facts for purposes of the appellant\u2019s document production motion only:\n1. All documents prepared, considered or relied on (by those Canada Revenue Agency officials involved) as part of the audit and assessing process leading up to the issuance of the notice of reassessment dated June 9, 2010, currently under appeal in this proceeding (the \u201cNOR\u201d), have been disclosed and produced to the appellant;\n2. The documents sought by the appellant in this motion were not prepared, considered or relied on (by those Canada Revenue Agency officials involved) as part of the audit and assessing process leading up to the issuance of the NOR;\n3. The issue of whether the general anti-avoidance provision under section 245 of the Income Tax Act applies was not considered by the Minister of National Revenue as part of the assessing process relating to the NOR. Rather, the issue was added by the Attorney General of Canada (the \u201cAGC\u201d) in their Further Amended Reply filed November 5, 2012 (the \u201cReply\u201d);\n4. The issues of whether:\na. The \u201cannual basic royalty\u201d and the net profit interest under the Royalty Agreements were computed by reference to the actual amount or value of production from a mineral resource within the meaning of \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d under paragraph 66(15)(e) of the Income Tax Act; and\/or\nb. 90% or more of the \"annual basic royalty\u201d or the net profit interest was payable out of, or from the proceeds of, the production from the mineral resource, within the definition of \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d under paragraph 66(15)(e) of the Income Tax Act;\nwere not considered by the Minister of National Revenue as part of the assessing process relating to the NOR. Rather, the issues were added by the AGC in their Reply.\n5. For greater certainty, the appellant does not agree that all documents relevant to any matter in issue in this appeal which are within the respondent\u2019s possession, control or power for the purposes of section 82 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) have been disclosed and\/or produced to the appellant. [italics added]\n[7] The parties also submitted the following affidavits:\n(a) an affidavit of Yina Qi, of the City of Vancouver, legal assistant, dated December 9, 2022;[6]\n(b) an affidavit of Anni Lam, of the City of Vancouver, legal assistant, dated April 12, 2017;[7] and\n(c) an affidavit of Swati Kinkar, of the City of Brampton, Appeals Officer, dated July 20, 2022.[8]\n[8] In relation to this motion, the Respondent submitted various documents to be held by the Court under seal (the \u201cSealed CRP Documents\u201d). In the accompanying cover letter dated July 21, 2022, the Respondent notes the following:[9]\n... We understand that the enclosed documents comprise a substantial portion of the documents which are being sought by the appellant, although it is acknowledged that if the appellant is successful on his motion and a subsequent Order confirming same is issued, a further search may have to be carried out. We further note that the enclosed listing does not include any documents withheld on grounds of cabinet confidence, which the appellant is no longer seeking (a listing of such documents has been provided to appellant\u2019s counsel).\nThe respondent takes the position that all of the enclosed documents are not relevant to the proceeding. However, where specific additional privileges are claimed, they have been indicated. Further, as indicated in the appellant\u2019s motion materials, much of the requested documentation was subject to a previous Access to Information Request. The document index provides some particularization of the relationship between the enclosed documents and that process.\n[9] The index to the documents held by the Court under seal and subject to this motion is included in both the Respondent\u2019s[10] and Appellant\u2019s[11] Motion Records.\n[10] The Appellant\u2019s Motion Record also included copies of The Amended Reference (the first section 174 application), the Further Amended Reply and the Amended Answer.[12]\n[11] The Respondent\u2019s Motion Record also included copies of the Reply to the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal, the Amended Reply to the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal, and the Further Amended Reply to the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal.[13]\n[12] The Appellant\u2019s Amended Notice of Motion also includes the following summary of his grounds for the motion:[14]\n1. The Respondent filed an application under section 174 of the Act on or about January 27, 2016, (the \u201cApplication\u201d), relating to Red Mile Resources Fund No. 3 Limited Partnership. The Respondent filed an Amended Reference under section 174 of the Act on March 10, 2017. Also on March 10, 2017, the Respondent filed applications substantially similar to the Application, relating to each of Red Mile Resources Fund No. 2 Limited Partnership, Red Mile Resources Fund No. 4 Limited Partnership, Red Mile Resources Fund No. 5 Limited Partnership, Red Mile Resources Fund No. 6 Limited Partnership, and Red Mile Resources Fund No. 7 Limited Partnership (collectively with the Application, as amended, the \u201cApplications\u201d).\n1.1 The Respondent subsequently withdrew the Applications under section 174, not because the issues were no longer key issues in the Appeals, but because the decision of Canada (National Revenue) v Boguski, 2021 FCA 118 (Boguski) rendered an application under section 174 procedurally unworkable.\n1.2 The issues raised in the Applications further confirm that one of the key issues that remains to be decided is the meaning and application of subsection 66(15) of the Act.\n2. In the Applications, the Respondent sought to have determined certain common questions. One of the common questions was whether or not 90% or more of the annual Basic Royalty in the Red Mile transactions was \u201cpayable out of, or from the proceeds of, the production from the mineral resource\u201d for the purposes of paragraph (e) of the definition of \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act (the \u201cQuestion\u201d).\n3. The phrase \u201cif the payer of the rental or royalty has an interest in, or for civil law a right in, the mineral resource and 90% or more of the rental or royalty is payable out of, or from the proceeds of, the production from the mineral resource\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act was added to the Act on or around December 20, 2002, when draft legislation was introduced to add the words to the definition (the \u201cAmendments\u201d).\n4. The Amendments ultimately became law on December 15, 2011, effective for rights acquired after December 20, 2002. The wording was added to bring the definition in line with the CRA\u2019s policy regarding net profits interest as a Canadian Resource Property as stated in Income Tax Technical News No. 10 dated (July 11, 1997).\n5. There is no jurisprudence that has considered either the meaning of the word \u201cpayable\u201d or the phrase \u201cpayable out of\u201d in the context of paragraphs (d) and (e) of the definition \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d.\n6. Documents such as background papers, ministerial statements, and committee reports are admissible to assist the Court in determining the legislative purpose of an amendment and the proper interpretation of a provision in the Act (or any amendments).\n7. The Documents sought in this application are required as an aid to the interpretation of paragraph (e) of the definition of \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act, which is the central legal issue in the Appeal.\n8. Counsel to the Applicant, Gall Legge Grant & Zwack LLP (\u201cGLGZ\u201d), received certain documents (the \u201cCanadian Resource Property Documents\u201d) relevant to the Question through a request made to the Department of Finance pursuant to the Access to Information Act.\n9. As is set out in the Affidavit of Anni Lam:\n(a) the Canadian Resource Property Documents include an extensively redacted copy of the CRA Memorandum prepared by and for the Respondent and provided by the Respondent to the Department of Finance;\n(b) the Canadian Resource Property Documents further include correspondence between the Respondent and the Department of Finance which indicates that there are more documents relevant to the Question which have not been listed and disclosed by the Respondent;\n(c) GLGZ provided the Canadian Resource Property Documents to the Respondent and requested disclosure of an unredacted copy of the CRA Memorandum, as well as additional relevant documents from the Respondent, in a letter dated May 25, 2016;\n(d) GLGZ followed up on their May 25 request in a letter dated July 19, 2016;\n(e) The Respondent replied in a letter dated November 25, 2016, denying the Applicant\u2019s request; and\n(f) To date, GLGZ has not received the requested documents from the Respondent.\n10. The Canadian Resource Property Documents confirm that relevant documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power have been omitted from the Respondent\u2019s affidavit of documents.\n11. The Applicant seeks production of all relevant materials so that the further conduct of the appeal may proceed without delay and with all relevant evidence.\n12. As the Applicant requested in their May 25, 2016 letter to the Respondent, the following materials are required:\na. an unredacted copy of the CRA Memorandum;\nb. copies of all documentation, communications, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power in respect of the exchange between the CRA and the Department of Finance over subsection 66(15) of the Act;\nc. copies of any other documentation, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power from the period of January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2012 in respect of the legislative amendments to the definition of \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act; and\nd. copies of any other documentation, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power in respect of the determination of the common questions in the Respondent\u2019s Applications.\n13. The Applicant submits that any relevant documents and materials in the possession, control, or power of the Respondent include all such documents and materials in the possession of the Minister of Finance, including materials pertinent to the legislative history of subsection 66(15) of the Act, such as background papers, ministerial statements, and committee reports.\n14. It is respectfully submitted that it is in the interest of the parties, the Court, and the administration of justice to issue the requested order for the disclosure and production of all relevant documents (in unredacted form) in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\n[13] The issue in this motion is whether the CRP Materials, including the Sealed CRP Documents, should be disclosed pursuant to Rules 82 and 88, which provide that:\n82. (1) The parties may agree or, in the absence of agreement, either party may apply to the Court for an order directing that each party shall file and serve on each other party a list of all the documents that are or have been in that party's possession, control or power relevant to any matter in question between or among them in the appeal. \u2026\n88. Where the Court is satisfied by any evidence that a relevant document in a party's possession, control or power may have been omitted from the party's affidavit of documents, or that a claim of privilege may have been improperly made, the Court may,\n(a) order cross-examination on the affidavit of documents,\n(b) order service of a further and better affidavit of documents,\n(c) order the disclosure or production for inspection of the document or a part of the document, if it is not privileged, and\n(d) inspect the document for the purpose of determining its relevance or the validity of a claim of privilege. [emphasis added]\n[14] The Appellant argues that the key issue in these appeals is the statutory interpretation of subsection 66(15) of the Act, including in particular the statutory amendments thereto which became law on December 15, 2011 with retroactive effect for rights acquired after December 20, 2002.\n[15] The Appellant submits that the CRP Materials, including the Sealed CRP Documents, are extrinsic evidence that are relevant for the purpose of undertaking a textual, contextual and purposive analysis of subsection 66(15) of the Act. The Appellant further submits that relevance is an inherently broad concept and that relevant documents include anything that \u201cmay directly or indirectly aid the party seeking the discovery to maintain its case or combat that of its adversary\u201d.[15]\n[16] The Respondent submits that the CRP Materials, including the Sealed CRP Documents, are not relevant because they were not prepared, considered, relied upon or used in any manner by the Minister in the course of the Minister\u2019s audit of the Appellant. The Respondent further submits that they do not clarify the Crown\u2019s legal position and the Respondent has not disclosed or otherwise conceded them to be relevant. The Respondent further submits that the CRP Materials, including the Sealed CRP Documents, are not permissible extrinsic aids because they were not before Parliament when considering and enacting the relevant legislation. The Respondent relies on cases such as CHR Investment Corporation v. The Queen, 2021 FCA 68 in support of its position.\n[17] I generally agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions in this motion. In my view, the outcome of any motion dealing with the production of documents at discovery always turns on relevance in the context of the facts in the particular case. The issues in this motion are distinguishable from the issues in cases such as Canada v. CHR Investment Corporation, 2021 FCA 68. For example, the key issue in this motion is not in relation to the Minister\u2019s position on the application of GAAR, but rather the production of extrinsic aids in relation to the statutory interpretation of subsection 66(15) of the Act. In addition, the parties have both agreed that none of the documents sought were considered by the Minister during the audit, as the key issues in relation to subsection 66(15) of the Act were only raised by the AGC for the first time in the Respondent\u2019s Further Amended Reply filed on November 5, 2012.\n[18] In my view, the principles set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Ahamed v. Canada, 2020 FCA 213 apply in the circumstances of this case. In that case, Locke J.A. noted the following at paragraphs 19 to 32:\n19 On the overarching issue of relevance, the Tax Court correctly noted various general principles applicable to discovery, including (i) that it should be broadly and liberally construed, (ii) that the threshold is lower in discovery than at trial, (iii) that earlier drafts of a final position paper do not have to be disclosed, and (iv) that even where relevance is established, the Court has a residual discretion to refuse document production.\n20 The appellant argues that the redacted internal Department of Finance documents are relevant to statutory interpretation, and should be produced in unredacted form. The appellant argues that documents prepared by government employees participating in the legislative process are admissible as permissible extrinsic aids. The appellant argues that relevance is not limited to documents that are published or otherwise available to the public.\n21 The Tax Court based its finding that the internal documents in question are of marginal relevance on Superior Plus Corp. v. R., 2016 TCC 217 (T.C.C. [General Procedure]) at para. 34, which provides such documents are not relevant to ascertaining the Minister's mental process in auditing and assessing a taxpayer, unless they have been communicated to the Minister. The respondent argues that the Tax Court was correct to apply the same reasoning to statutory interpretation: internal finance documents that have not been communicated to the Minister are not relevant to ascertaining Parliamentary intent.\n22 It is tempting to follow this reasoning and to agree with the respondent's position that documents must be publicly available in order to be relevant to statutory interpretation. Otherwise, it would be possible for members of the public to be left without access to certain information that is necessary to fully understand a particular law with which they are required to comply. Such a situation would be problematic for the reasons mentioned in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v. Hart, [1992] 3 W.L.R. 1032 (U.K. H.L.) at 1042:\nA statute is, after all, the formal and complete intimation to the citizen of a particular rule of the law which he is enjoined, sometimes under penalty, to obey and by which he is both expected and entitled to regulate his conduct. We must, therefore, I believe, be very cautious in opening the door to the reception of material not readily or ordinarily accessible to the citizen whose rights and duties are to be affected by the words in which the legislature has elected to express its will.\n23 Notwithstanding this concern, the appellant argues that the scope of documents that could be relevant to statutory interpretation is viewed more broadly. For example, the appellant cites Delisle c. Canada (Sous-procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 989 (S.C.C.) (Delisle), which concerned an argument that a provision of a federal statute violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of The Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c 11. As part of his analysis on behalf of the majority of the Court in Delisle, Bastarache J. considered the purpose of the statutory provision in question in the course of interpreting it. At para. 17, he stated as follows:\n[...] Although extrinsic sources may be used to interpret legislation and to determine its true meaning, when the meaning of the challenged provision is clear, they are of little assistance in determining the purpose of a statute in order to evaluate whether it is consistent with the Charter. Generally, the Court must not strike down an enactment which does not infringe the Charter in its meaning, form or effects, which would force Parliament to re-enact the same text, but with an extrinsic demonstration of a valid purpose. That would be an absurd scenario because it would ascribe a direct statutory effect to simple statements, internal reports and other external sources which, while they are useful when a judge must determine the meaning of an obscure provision, are not sufficient to strike down a statutory enactment which is otherwise consistent with the Charter. Legislative intent must have an institutional quality, as it is impossible to know what each member of Parliament was thinking. It must reflect what was known to the members at the time of the vote. It must also have regard to the fact that the members were called upon to vote on a specific wording, for which an institutional explanation was provided. The wording and justification thereof are important precisely because members have a duty to understand the meaning of the statute on which they are voting. This is more important than speculation on the subjective intention of those who proposed the enactment. (emphasis added)\n24 This passage recognizes the potential relevance of internal documents to the interpretation of \u201cobscure\u201d statutory provisions. It is not clear what constitutes \u201cobscure\u201d, and I do not reach a conclusion on this point. I note that this passage does not state clearly whether internal, non-public documents can be relevant to statutory interpretation. In fact, the focus on \u201cwhat was known to the members [of Parliament] at the time of the vote,\u201d suggests that non-public documents are not relevant.\n25 Ruth Sullivan, in Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes, 6th ed., (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2014) at \u00a723.11 casts a broad net for the types of documents that can be relevant to statutory interpretation:\nLike evidence of external context, opinions about the purpose and meaning of legislation can be found anywhere: before enactment, in the materials generated by government employees participating in the legislative process (instructing officers, drafters, legal opinion givers) and, after enactment, in interpretive guidelines issued by administrative agencies, in judicial or administrative case law and in the daily decisions of government employees charged with administering the legislation. Until recently, the primary source of opinion about the meaning of legislation was judicial case law. Courts were unwilling to look at the practice of bureaucrats or the opinions of administrative tribunals and, except for standard textbooks, scholarly opinion was largely ignored. The current tendency, however, is to look at any material that meets the threshold test of relevance and reliability.\n26 Again, this passage does not state clearly that non-public documents can be relevant to statutory interpretation. However, it does appear that the legislative process (during which relevant documents could be created) begins early. In Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765 (S.C.C.) (Mikisew Cree First Nation) at para. 120, Brown J. stated that \u201cthe legislative process begins with a bill's formative stages, even where the bill is developed by ministers of the Crown.\u201d Brown J went on in paragraph 121 to state\nPublic servants making policy recommendations prior to the formulation and introduction of a bill are not \u201cexecuting\u201d existing legislative policy or direction. Their actions, rather, are directed to informing potential changes to legislative policy and are squarely legislative in nature.\n27 Care must be taken not to read Mikisew Cree First Nation too broadly. That case concerned whether the law-making process (described at paragraph 116 thereof as the steps from initial policy development to royal assent) was subject to the Crown's duty to consult indigenous peoples about steps that could adversely affect their rights. Mikisew Cree First Nation was not concerned with statutory interpretation.\n28 Sullivan, relying on the Newfoundland Court of Appeal decision in Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, 1980 (1981), 134 D.L.R. (3d) 288, 36 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 273 (Nfld. C.A.), rev'd [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297 (S.C.C.) (Upper Churchill), goes on at \u00a723.13 to state:\nWhen the purpose of a provision is discussed or its meaning explained during the enactment process, and the legislation is then passed on that understanding, the explanation or discussion offers persuasive (if not conclusive) evidence of the legislature's intent.\n29 However, the Supreme Court of Canada in Upper Churchill offered a more nuanced approach to the relevance of extrinsic evidence. After discussing the relaxation of the former general exclusionary rule against admissibility of extrinsic evidence, the Court stated at p. 318:\nIt will therefore be open to the Court in a proper case to receive and consider extrinsic evidence on the operation and effect of the legislation. In view of the positions of the parties, particularly the appellants' contention that the Reversion Act has extra-provincial effect, this is, in my opinion, such a case.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal in the present case that extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the background against which the legislation was enacted. I also agree that such evidence is not receivable as an aid to construction of the statute. However, I am also of the view that in constitutional cases, particularly where there are allegations of colourability, extrinsic evidence may be considered to ascertain not only the operation and effect of the impugned legislation but its true object and purpose as well. This was also the view of Dickson J. in the Reference re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [[1981] 1 S.C.R. 714], at p. 721, where he said:\nIn my view a court may, in a proper case, require to be informed as to what the effect of the legislation will be. The object or purpose of the Act in question may also call for consideration though, generally speaking, speeches made in the Legislature at the time of enactment of the measure are inadmissible as having little evidential weight.\nThis view is subject, of course, to the limitation suggested by Dickson J., at p. 723 of the same case, that only evidence which is not inherently unreliable or offending against public policy should be admissible...\n30 Not only does the Supreme Court leave room for cases where extrinsic evidence will not be relevant, but it also limits the issues to which such evidence might be relevant. Moreover, it should be noted that Upper Churchill was in a constitutional law context, in which the Supreme Court has traditionally been more open to extrinsic evidence (see p. 317).\n31 In the end, though there are good reasons to be reluctant to consider non-public documents in the exercise of statutory interpretation, it is difficult to state unequivocally that such documents could never be relevant. The better question is whether the documents in question in the present appeal have an institutional quality such that they could represent the government's position concerning the legislation at issue. If not, such documents are not relevant.\n[19] As noted in Ahamed, non-public documents may be relevant as extrinsic evidence in certain cases for statutory interpretation, provided they have sufficient institutional quality so that they are not inherently unreliable. It is also my view that the categories of extrinsic evidence are not closed, and must be considered in the context of each case.\n[20] In this case, the amendments at issue in paragraph (e) of the definition of \u201cCanadian resource property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act were first announced in 2002 and not enacted until 2011 with retroactive effect. It is apparent to the Court that the legislative process relating to the amendments at issue in these appeals started well before 2002. This is a relatively obscure definition in a complex statute. In my view, considering the long development time for the proposed amendments and the complexity and retroactive effect of the relevant provisions, extrinsic evidence may be relevant to the Court in undertaking a textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the legislation in all of the circumstances of this case. It may also assist the Appellant in fully understanding the Respondent\u2019s position in these appeals and inform the Respondent of the reasonableness of its position.\n[21] I note that Tech Interp (external) 2003-004860A \u2014 Canadian resource property \u2014 rentals and royalties, dated December 2, 2003, is an example of extrinsic evidence with institutional quality that relates directly to the issues under appeal herein. As it is a public document, disclosure of that document is not an issue in this motion.\n[22] Applying these principles to this case, it is my view that none of the documents included in tabs 1-23 of the Sealed CRP Documents should be disclosed. In this respect, it is my view that those documents have little to no relevance to the issues under appeal in this case. It is also my view that they have little to no institutional quality.\n[23] It is my view, however, that the documents set out in tabs 24 and 25 of the Sealed CRP Documents should be disclosed. In this respect, it is my view that those documents have sufficient relevance to the issues under appeal in this case and have sufficient institutional quality that they should be disclosed in all of the circumstances of these appeals.\n[24] In its letter to the Court dated July 21, 2022 in relation to this motion, the Respondent advised the Court that \u201c\u2026 it is acknowledged that if the appellant is successful on his motion and a subsequent Order confirming same is issued, a further search may have to be carried out.\u201d As such, the Respondent has acknowledged that it may have other relevant documents which should be produced in the context of these appeals.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Based on all of the foregoing, Mr. Hartman\u2019s motion is allowed in part.\n[26] The Respondent is ordered to list and disclose the following:\n(a) a complete and unredacted copy of the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) memorandum by Roy Shultis dated September 9, 1997 a copy of which is included at tab 25 of the Sealed CRP Documents;\n(b) to the extent they have not already been provided to the Appellant, a complete and unredacted copy of the CRA memorandum by Wayne Adams dated December 22, 1997 and the Department of Finance memorandum by Daniel MacIntosh dated May 20, 1998, copies of which are included at tab 24 of the Sealed CRP Documents; and\n(c) copies of all other documents, communications, notes, records, and materials in the Respondent\u2019s possession, control, or power which may be considered extrinsic evidence with institutional quality from January 1, 1996 that concern the purpose, intention, meaning, or interpretation of the term \u201cCanadian Resource Property\u201d in subsection 66(15) of the Act, including in particular to the amendments thereto that are at issue in these appeals.\nCOSTS\n[27] The costs of this motion shall follow the cause.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of May 2024.\n\u201cHenry A.

Introduction\n[1] In 2019, Arlo Litman built a laneway house on top of a detached garage on his property in Ottawa. In 2021, he claimed a new housing rebate in the amount of $17,372.38 in respect of the laneway house pursuant to section 256 of the Excise Tax Act, RSC 1985, c E-15 (ETA). The Minister of National Revenue (Minister) denied the rebate application, primarily on the basis that the Appellant had not made substantial renovations to a housing unit.\n[2] The Appellant testified that he built the laneway house as a place of residence for his mother-in-law, so that she could live close to her daughter and grandchildren, and age in place. He asserted that his mother-in-law lived there continuously for over a year but because of changes in the family, she now splits her time between Ottawa and her condominium in Waterloo, where her son lives.\nII. Issue\n[3] The sole issue in this appeal is whether Mr. Litman is eligible for the new housing rebate and more specifically, whether he meets the conditions set out in subsection 256(2) of the ETA. In light of the parties\u2019 submissions at the hearing, I would characterize the fundamental question as being whether the Appellant constructed or substantially renovated a residential complex for use as a primary place of residence for a relation of his as required by paragraph 256(2)(a) of the ETA. However, I hasten to add that the Appellant must also meet the other conditions for the rebate found in paragraphs 256(2)(b) to (d).\n[4] Subsection 256(2) of the ETA reads as follows:\nRebate for owner-built homes\n(2) Where\n(a) a particular individual constructs or substantially renovates, or engages another person to construct or substantially renovate for the particular individual, a residential complex that is a single unit residential complex or a residential condominium unit for use as the primary place of residence of the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual,\n(b) the fair market value of the complex, at the time the construction or substantial renovation thereof is substantially completed, is less than $450,000,\n(c) the particular individual has paid tax in respect of the supply by way of sale to the individual of the land that forms part of the complex or an interest therein or in respect of the supply to, or importation by, the individual of any improvement thereto or, in the case of a mobile home or floating home, of the complex (the total of which tax under subsection 165(1) and sections 212 and 218 is referred to in this subsection as the \u201ctotal tax paid by the particular individual\u201d),\n(d) either\n(i) the first individual to occupy the complex after the construction or substantial renovation is begun is the particular individual or a relation of the particular individual, or\n(ii) the particular individual makes an exempt supply by way of sale of the complex and ownership of the complex is transferred to the recipient before the complex is occupied by any individual as a place of residence or lodging,\nthe Minister shall, subject to subsection (3), pay a rebate to the particular individual equal to the amount determined by the formula\nA \u00d7 ($450,000 -

I refer to them throughout these reasons and their complete text can be found in Appendix A.\nIII. Facts\n[6] In 2016, the Appellant purchased the property at 80 Huron Avenue North for $810,000. The property included a house and a detached garage. The house has four levels, with a third attic floor and a finished basement. Each level measures approximately 1,000 square feet.\n[7] The laneway house sits on the pre-existing garage, which continues to be used as a garage. The laneway house contains a kitchen, bathroom and laundry room. It measures about 373 square feet, although its footprint measures approximately 651 square feet. The Appellant explained that the garage was lowered, the drywall was removed, the garage door was removed, modified and reattached and a separate entrance was constructed. The concrete pad and the foundation remained in place, as did the studs. The electrical system was redone. There is a secondary electrical panel in the garage and the electricity is \u201cfed\u201d through the main panel in the house; there is one electricity bill. The sewage pipes go through the main house while the gas line goes directly to the laneway house.\n[8] The laneway house was never rented, never used as an Airbnb nor was it ever a place of business. The Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law was the first and exclusive occupant of the laneway house. The Appellant expressed the view that if he were to sell his house, the garage and the laneway house would also have to be sold, as he did not think that severance would be authorized.\n[9] In addition to testifying for himself, the Appellant called Rayeed Choudhury, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) appeals officer on this file. At the time of his involvement in this matter, Mr. Choudhury had about 4.5 years of experience in that role. He asserted that he was familiar with the new housing rebate but acknowledged that this was his first file involving a laneway house. I found Mr. Choudhury to be a credible and generally forthright witness but there is very little, if any, useful evidence that came out of his testimony. I do not fault him for that.\n[10] Mr. Choudhury stated that he was familiar with the CRA\u2019s practices and guidance regarding laneway houses. The Appellant spent considerable time examining Mr. Choudhury, referring to examples in CRA administrative documents and asking which of those were most similar to the Appellant\u2019s situation. In addition to several hypothetical questions, Mr. Choudhury was asked whether he agreed with the information in the CRA materials. I find that whatever an appeals officer may think of what the CRA wrote in its public administrative documents is of no relevance to the application of the law to the Appellant\u2019s circumstances. Mr. Choudhury asserted that CRA documents, such as the GST\/HST Technical Information Bulletin B-092 (Exhibit A-10; [Bulletin B-092]), offer guidance but are not determinative.\n[11] Mr. Choudhury acknowledged that in examining the Appellant\u2019s objection, he concluded that the renovations did not meet the requirements of a substantial renovation pursuant to subsection 256(2) of the ETA. Although not included in the reasons for denying the rebate in the notice of confirmation, Mr. Choudhury stated that he had also considered that the laneway house was not a newly constructed property. He found that it was an addition to a pre-existing structure, that being the garage, which was part of the main house property.\nIV. The Parties\u2019 Positions\nThe Appellant\u2019s position\n[12] In his application, the Appellant claimed the new housing rebate on the basis that the laneway house was a substantial renovation of the pre-existing garage (see Exhibit A-4, Construction Summary Worksheet; see also the Appellant\u2019s written submissions at para 18). In his notice of appeal, the Appellant\u2019s main argument was that the laneway house is a substantially renovated residential complex but added that in the alternative, the laneway house is a newly constructed housing unit.\n[13] At the hearing, the Appellant switched his positions and focussed on his argument that the laneway house with the garage was a separate newly constructed residential complex. He expressed the view that the laneway house met the definition of \u201csingle unit residential complex\u201d found in subsection 256(1) of the ETA because it includes a residential complex that does not contain more than two units. He further argued that he meets the definition of residential complex in subsection 123(1) of the ETA because \u201cthe laneway house is its own residential complex\u201d. In his view, the existence of a garage does not change the character of the laneway house as a residential complex. The Appellant submitted that there was not a residential complex before, and now there is one, such that there is a new residential complex. He added that it was not necessary to knock down the garage entirely and start from scratch to build the laneway house in order to be entitled to the rebate.\n[14] Although, at times it appeared that the Appellant was conflating his arguments, I will treat his submissions on substantial renovation as an alternative argument.\nThe Respondent\u2019s position\n[15] The Respondent argued that the Appellant had not substantially renovated a residential complex nor had he constructed a new residential complex. The Respondent asserts that in determining whether the Appellant is eligible for the rebate, one has to consider the house and the garage with the laneway house as a whole because they are inseparable.\n[16] The Respondent asserted that the separate garage was an appurtenance to the main house such that the laneway house is a renovation of a residential complex that includes the main house. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that unless there is separate title there could be no rebate. He later stated that he did not know if separate legal title was necessarily a requirement. The Respondent submitted that the Appellant did not meet the meaning of substantial renovation, which generally requires that all or substantially all of a building, ignoring core structural elements, have been removed or replaced and this has been interpreted as meaning 90%.\nV. Analysis\n[17] The Appellant referred to the Goods and Services Tax Technical Paper wherein the Honourable Michael H. Wilson, Minister of Finance, asserted that \u201c[t]hrough this system of tax rebates, the government will meet its commitment to ensure that the new system does not pose a barrier to the affordability of housing in Canada\u201d. (Exhibit A-14, August 1989 at p 19). The Appellant suggested that, in light of the housing crisis, those pronouncements were just as important today as they were 35 years ago. In his written submissions, the Appellant submitted that the denial of the rebate on laneway houses \u201cwould eliminate the availability of a key rebate that would otherwise incentivize much-needed construction that is required to address the housing crisis. This could in turn, impact the availability of diverse housing options, decrease housing affordability, and increase suburban sprawl, among other impacts\u201d (Appellant\u2019s written submissions at para 9).\n[18] One would have to have their head buried in the sand not to recognize that Canada is facing a national housing crisis and that measures are being taken to address this challenge. Having said that, I cannot ignore that the new housing rebate provision at issue in this appeal is replete with restrictions and conditions that must be met failing which there is no entitlement to the rebate. The rebate provision is an exception to the ETA\u2019s purpose, which is to raise government revenue. I adopt the view expressed in previous cases describing the rebate provision as a limited exception and, moreover, as a carefully tailored exception to the application of the GST (see Canada v Sneyd, 2000 CanLII 15708 (FCA) at para 13; Erickson v R, 2001 CanLII 569 (TCC) at para 15).\n[19] I will now consider the specific requirements of subsection 256(2) of the ETA to determine the Appellant\u2019s eligibility to the new housing rebate. To meet the condition expressed in paragraph 256(2)(a) of the ETA, the Appellant must show that in having the laneway house built over a pre-existing garage he either constructed or substantially renovated a residential complex that is a \u201csingle unit residential complex\u201d. This latter expression is defined in subsection 256(1) to include \u201ca multiple unit residential complex that does not contain more than two residential units\u201d. In turn, \u201ca multiple unit residential complex\u201d is defined in subsection 123(1) of the ETA to mean \u201ca residential complex that contains more than one residential unit, but does not include a condominium complex\u201d. The definition of \u201cresidential unit\u201d is found in subsection 123(1) of the ETA. The term is defined as including a detached house, semi-detached house, condominium unit, mobile home, apartment or similar premises and has been interpreted broadly. I find that the Appellant\u2019s laneway house, described earlier, is an apartment or similar premise and meets the definition of residential unit.\n[20] Although the definitions are somewhat circular, the rebate is aimed at dwellings that contain no more than two residential units. In the circumstances, whether we are considering the whole property including the primary house and the laneway house or whether we are only considering the laneway house over the garage, and if either is a residential complex, it is a single unit residential complex.\n[21] Having so found, I must consider the definition of \u201cresidential complex\u201d. The Appellant\u2019s main argument at trial, as indicated earlier, is that in building the laneway house on top of his pre-existing garage he constructed a new residential complex. The Respondent submitted that the laneway house was a residential unit but not a residential complex because it did not have a separate title. The Respondent argued that the Court must consider the property including the main house as a whole, the garage being an appurtenance to the main house and the land.\n[22] The CRA has offered its guidance on how it might treat \u201cguest and granny suites\u201d for the purposes of the new housing rebate. I hasten to add that these are the CRA\u2019s views, they are not law, and they are not binding on this Court. However, as asserted by the Supreme Court of Canada, \u201c[i]t is well established that in resolving doubt about the meaning of a tax provision, the administrative practice and interpretation adopted by the Minister, while not determinative, are important factors to be weighed\u201d (Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v Ontario (Minister of Finance, 2006 SCC 20 at para 10, referring to Harel v Deputy Minister of Revenue of Quebec, [1978] 1 SCR 851).\n[23] In Bulletin B-092, supra, the CRA writes as follows (at pp 30-31):\nThe construction of a guest and granny suite may be eligible for the new housing rebate where:\nthe suite is constructed as an addition to the existing building and the existing building is substantially renovated;\nthe suite is constructed as an addition to the existing building and the addition is, or is intended to be, owned under separate title; or\nwhere a self-contained suite is detached from the house so that it is its own building. In this situation, the rebate would be based on the fact that there is a newly constructed residential complex rather than a substantial renovation of an existing one.\n[24] The CRA goes on to give examples of the situations described above. The \u201cBill M.\u201d example refers to the construction of a separate building that will be a self-contained granny suite, not held under separate title, and suggests that Bill would qualify for the rebate because he constructed a new residential complex (Bulletin B-092, supra at p 31). Thus, it appears that, according to the CRA, if the laneway house had been constructed directly on land as opposed to sitting on the pre-existing garage, and assuming all other conditions are met, the Appellant would have qualified for the rebate.\n[25] Query whether the fact that the laneway house was built on the pre-existing garage, rather than being self-standing like the granny suite built by Bill M. in the CRA\u2019s example, disqualifies it from being a newly built residential complex. I find that it does not. The laneway house is detached from the main house and it forms a new residential complex where, prior to its construction, there was none. In addition, I see nothing in the definition of residential complex that requires that the laneway house be held under separate title to meet the requirements of that definition. And as noted earlier, CRA\u2019s own example suggests otherwise.\n[26] I note that both parties referred to this Court\u2019s decision in Lemieux v R (2009 TCC 17) wherein Justice Tardif found that the Appellant was not entitled to the new housing rebate. In Lemieux, the appellant had constructed an addition, on top of a two-car garage attached to an existing 2,400 square-foot residence. I find the circumstances of that case to be so different from those in the present case that it is of little, if any, assistance in determining the issue before the Court.\n[27] I found the Appellant\u2019s testimony about the occupancy of the laneway house to be credible. He stated that the laneway house was built for his mother-in-law. Although she now spends part of her time at her condominium in Waterloo where her son and his family live, she was the first and only occupant and she lived in the laneway house continuously for over a year. I note that the Respondent agreed that if I were to find that the Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law lived in the laneway house for a year, the Appellant met the requirement that it be the primary place of residence of a relation (see the definitions of \u201crelation\u201d in subsection 256(1) and of \u201crelated\u201d in subsection 126(2) of the ETA).\n[28] For the reasons above, I find that the Appellant meets the condition in the concluding words of subsection 256(2)(a) of the ETA which requires that a residential complex be used as a primary place of residence of a relation of his. As the Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law was the first and only person to occupy the laneway house, the condition expressed in paragraph 256(2)(d) is also met.\n[29] At this point, it bears mentioning that the Application for the new housing rebate, Form GST 191, submitted in September 2021 was not before the Court. In addition, when submitting Form GST 191, the individual making the claim is required to fill out a Construction Summary Worksheet, Form GST 191-WS, and attach it to Form GST 191. The full worksheet also was not before the Court. The Appellant introduced into evidence only pages 1, 2 and 3 of the 12-page document. Part C of Form GST 191-WS on pages 4 to 11 contains a chart wherein the individual applying for the rebate provides information about the construction details and invoices, including the amount of GST paid. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, neither party thought that the application form and the complete worksheet would be useful information for the Court in the circumstances of this appeal. Perhaps this reinforces the view that the basis for the Respondent\u2019s position that the rebate should be denied was not related to the requirement set out paragraph 256(2)(c) of the ETA.\n[30] Paragraph 256(2)(c) of the ETA requires that the individual applying for the rebate have paid tax on the land that forms part of the complex or on any improvement thereto. In their Reply, the Respondent admitted that \u201cthe Minister refused the Appellant\u2019s application on the basis that it did not satisfy the criteria of subparagraph 256(2)(a)\u201d but denied that \u201cthe Minister did not contest subparagraphs 256(2)(b) through (d) of the Act in further detail\u201d (Reply at para 7). The Respondent did not otherwise refer to any such \u201ccontest\u201d. According to the Reply, the Minister made no assumptions of fact about tax having been paid by the Appellant on the land or any improvement thereto. Further, in the grounds relied on in their Reply, the Respondent made no submissions regarding the condition set out in paragraph 256(2)(c). I find that, by virtue of having paid tax on the building materials and services and fees such as architect\u2019s fees associated with the construction of the laneway house, the Appellant has satisfied this requirement.\n[31] In order to be eligible for the new housing rebate, paragraph 256(2)(b) of the ETA further requires that the fair market value of the complex, at the time the construction or substantial renovation is completed, be less than $450,000. The formula for the calculation of the rebate contained in subsection 256(2) provides that the rebate is gradually reduced when the fair market value of the property rises above $350,000. Once the fair market value reaches $450,000, the rebate is completely eliminated. In Somers v R, (2008 TCC 239 at para 4 [Somers]), Justice Webb explained the relevance of the fair market value for the purposes of the rebate as follows:\nTherefore if the fair market value of the residence was $350,000 or less, the actual fair market value is not relevant. If the fair market value was greater than $350,000 and less than $450,000, the actual fair market value is relevant as the amount of the fair market value would reduce the new housing rebate that would otherwise be available. If the fair market value of the residence was $450,000 or more, the actual fair market value is not relevant as no new housing rebate is available for properties with a fair market value within this range.\n[32] In light of the definition of residential complex, the land immediately contiguous to the building that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building as a place of residence must be included when determining fair market value.\n[33] The Appellant purchased the property including the main house and detached garage in 2016 for $810,000. At the hearing, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant was not entitled to the rebate because the fair market value of the \u201cproperty\u201d, defined as including the main house and the laneway house, exceeded $450,000.\n[34] However, as I found that the Appellant constructed a new residential complex when he engaged someone to construct the laneway house, the rebate must be calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the laneway house and the land on which it sits. I would add that this finding is consistent with the CRA\u2019s own assertions in GST\/HST Info Sheet GI-168 (Exhibit A-11 at pp 14-15).\n[35] I acknowledge that the definition of fair market value accepted by the courts is found in Henderson Estate and Bank of New York v MNR (73 DTC 5471 at p 5476 (FCTD)) wherein Justice Cattanach stated as follows:\nThat common understanding I take to mean the highest price an asset might reasonably be expected to bring if sold by the owner in the normal method applicable to the asset in question in the ordinary course of business in a market not exposed to any undue stresses and composed of willing buyers and sellers dealing at arm\u2019s length and under no compulsion to buy or sell.\n[36] Neither party called an expert to provide an opinion on the fair market value of the laneway house. The Appellant testified that he sought, unsuccessfully, to have the laneway house appraised. He communicated with two accredited appraisers both of which replied that they could not provide a valuation as there were no comparables (see also Exhibit A-4, Form GST191-WS). In applying for the rebate, the Appellant used the construction costs of $255,607.90 to which he added $100,000 to account for the value of the land (see Exhibit A-4, Form GST191-WS).\n[37] In Qureshi v R (2006 TCC 485 at para 10), Chief Justice Bowman, as he then was, stated, \u201c[t]here is simply no justification for using cost or replacement cost as a measure of valuing when there is a market in which comparables are available.\u201d I would add that in Somers, supra, Justice Webb did not accept cost as an appropriate valuation method as there was evidence of comparable properties for him to consider. I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he was unable to obtain an appraisal of the laneway house from two accredited appraisers who could not find comparables. I find that when there is no market to which one may look, construction costs which represent expenditures on which GST was paid can serve as an appropriate, although imperfect, valuation method.\n[38] In applying for the rebate, the Appellant used the construction costs of $255,607.90 to which he added $100,000 to account for the value of the land (see Exhibit A-4, Form GST191-WS). I note that in paragraph 14 of their Reply, the Respondent stated additional facts in support of the assessment, facts for which they bear the onus of proof (Canada v Loewen, 2004 FCA 146 at paras 10-11). Paragraphs 14a), b) and c) of the Reply read as follows:\n14. The AGC further states the following additional facts in support of the assessment under appeal:\na) The Fair Market Value of the Property, after completion of the renovations, is equal to at least $450,000.00;\nb) The Appellant estimated the fair market value of the coach house to be $355,607.90;\nc) The Appellant estimated FMV was based on the construction costs and his own estimate of $100,000 for the roughly 30ft by 33ft portion of his plot that the garage occupied;\n[39] Nowhere in the Reply does the Respondent dispute the amount of construction costs of $255,607.90 on which the Appellant based the calculation of the rebate according to the partial worksheet entered into evidence. Nor did Counsel for the Respondent take issue with this amount at the hearing. In response to questions from the Court about the $355,607.90 valuation, Counsel for the Respondent stated he could not speak to the fair market value of the laneway house because it could not be put on the market.\n[40] I note that this Court has the discretion to disregard the rules of evidence when an appeal is heard under the informal procedure as is the present case (see Selmeci v R, 2002 FCA 293; Suchon v R, 2002 FCA 282). I hasten to add that the Federal Court of Appeal and this Court have asserted that this not mean that no rules of evidence apply and that a judge is obligated to accept all evidence that is tendered.\n[41] I would have preferred that the complete worksheet, showing how the amount of construction costs was tabulated, be entered into evidence. However, I am prepared to accept the amount of $255,607.90 as construction costs on the basis of it being indicated on the partial worksheet (Exhibit A-4) and the Respondent having included this assumption of fact by virtue of the combination of paragraphs 14b) and c) in the Reply without raising any related concerns in the Reply or at the hearing.\n[42] Regarding the estimate of $100,000 for the land contiguous to the laneway house, the Appellant did not provide any details of how he arrived at his estimate other than to indicate that he considered the size of the land occupied by the garage. He submitted that the appraisers to whom he spoke had suggested that the land would have nominal value since it could not be severed and developed. Nevertheless, the Appellant decided to assign a value of $100,000 to the land.\n[43] I note that the property was purchased in 2016 for $810,000. I would add that in his Answer, the Appellant wrote that the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation assessed the value of the entire property in 2023 at $755,000. I understand that such assessments are also imperfect (see for example, Somers, supra). However, these two valuations provide important information in determining the reasonableness of the Appellant\u2019s valuation of the land at $100,000. The Respondent did not challenge this amount nor did they raise any related concerns. In light of the information above, I find that the amount of $100,000 assigned to the land is reasonable.\n[44] Imperfect as it is, I find that, for purposes of calculating the rebate, the Appellant has established that the value of the laneway house and the contiguous land is $355,607.90.\n[45] For completeness, and because of the Minister\u2019s initial reason for denying the rebate, I will briefly address the Appellant\u2019s alternative argument, that he substantially renovated the garage such that the laneway house qualifies as a substantially renovated residential complex. I find that it does not. In order to renovate, let alone substantially renovate, a residential complex, there must first be a residential complex. I have canvassed the definition of this term earlier in these reasons. In my view, the pre-existing garage alone was not capable of being occupied as a place of residence; it was not a residential complex. If I were to consider the whole property including the main house to be the residential complex for the purposes of determining eligibility to the rebate, then I would find that the Appellant does not meet the meaning of \u201csubstantially renovate\u201d as this term has been interpreted in the case law (see for example Whittall v R, 2017 TCC 212). Hence, the Appellant\u2019s alternative argument that, in building the laneway house, he substantially renovated a residential complex as provided for in subsection 256(2)(a) must fail.\nVI. Conclusion\n[46] For the reasons above, I conclude that the Appellant meets the conditions set out in subsection 256(2) of the ETA, and in particular, the condition that requires that he have constructed (or engaged another person to construct) a residential complex. He is thus entitled to the new housing rebate calculated on the basis of his construction costs for the laneway house and the value of the contiguous land.\n[47] Although the Appellant abandoned his request for costs at the end of the hearing, presumably because he felt pressed for time, he did address this issue in his written submissions. The Appellant asserted that he was a highly experienced lawyer and had spent at least 50 hours in preparation of his appeal. He felt strongly that he should be entitled to costs in the amount of $870. The Appellant submitted that the Court enjoys a broad discretion to award costs in this appeal. He referred to several decisions, which I find inapplicable for various reasons including that they were appeals under other legislation such as the Income Tax Act and\/or under the general procedure, or other types of matters before a different court.\n[48] But more importantly, in section 18.3009 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, Parliament has chosen to limit the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to award costs in GST\/HST appeals under the informal procedure. Hence, no costs can be awarded to the Appellant in this appeal (see Canada v DiFlorio, 2015 FCA 11 at para 9, Wang v R, 2021 TCC 86 at para 39).\n[49] The appeal from the assessment made under the Excise Tax Act in respect of the new housing rebate is allowed, without costs, and the assessment is referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 3rd day of May 2024.\n\u201cGabrielle St-Hilaire\u201d\nSt-Hilaire J.\nAppendix A \u2013 Definitions - Excise Tax Act\nDefinition of single unit residential complex in subsection 256(1)\nsingle unit residential complex includes\n(a) a multiple unit residential complex that does not contain more than two residential units, and\n(b) any other multiple unit residential complex if it is described by paragraph (c) of the definition residential complex in subsection 123(1) and contains one or more residential units that are for supply as rooms in a hotel, motel, inn, boarding house, lodging house or similar premises and that would be excluded from being part of the residential complex if the complex were a residential complex not described by that paragraph.

I will refer to the appeals of the 79 named Appellants as the \u201c79 Appeals\u201d.\n[2] The 79 Appellants argue that the Court should allow the 79 Appeals because of a delay in the hearing of the appeals caused by the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the appeal of the three appellants in Choptiany v. The King (\u201cChoptiany et al.\u201d).[1]\n[3] During an October 12, 2022 case management conference, counsel for the Appellants noted that he intended to file this motion with respect to the 79 Appeals. I informed the parties during the hearing and subsequently ordered, that the motion would proceed as follows:\n-The Appellants were to file their motion on or before November 14, 2022, returnable on March 10, 2023.\n-The Appellants\u2019 motion record was to be filed on or before December 12, 2022.\n-The Respondent\u2019s motion record was to be filed on or before January 23, 2023.\n-The Appellants\u2019 reply submissions, if any, were to be filed on or before February 26, 2023.\n[4] In a motion such as the one before the Court, the submissions must set out a party\u2019s complete argument. The Court does not allow a party to ambush the other party by raising an argument for the first time at the hearing of the motion.\n[5] The Appellants filed their motion record on December 12, 2022. It contained four and a half pages of actual written submissions. The Appellants did not file any affidavit evidence to support the factual assertions made in their brief submissions.\n[6] The Respondent\u2019s motion record included 10 pages of written submissions together with a lengthy affidavit that provided evidence to support the factual assertions made in his submissions.\n[7] I am troubled by the fact that the Appellants filed sparse submissions in support of a motion in which the Appellants are asking the Court to allow 79 appeals, each involving different taxpayers who were assessed substantial gross negligence penalties. In such a situation, I would expect, at a minimum, that the Appellants file an affidavit containing factual information showing how the conduct of the Respondent in the Choptiany et al. appeals supports their position that the Court should allow the 79 Appeals.\n[8] For example, paragraph 4 of the Appellants\u2019 written submissions states that the Appellants and the Respondent agreed to select three lead cases and that the decision of the lead cases would negate the need for multiplicity of proceedings having regard to the Appellants\u2019 common arguments. The Appellants filed no evidence to support this statement. In fact, as I will discuss, this statement is not supported by the facts placed before the Court by the Respondent.\n[9] If I were to issue my Order based solely on the written submissions of the Appellants, I would summarily dismiss the motion since the Appellants have not provided the Court with evidence to support the factual assertions that form the foundation of their motion.\n[10] However, the Respondent did provide the Court with an affidavit containing relevant facts. My Order is based on the facts contained in the affidavit, the Court\u2019s public files with respect to the 79 Appeals, and the relevant jurisprudence.\nBackground\n[11] The 79 Appellants participated in either the Fiscal Arbitrators or the DeMara Consulting tax schemes (the \u201cFiscal Arbitrators scheme\u201d and the \u201cDeMara scheme\u201d). It appears that some of the Appellants participated in both schemes.\n[12] The Federal Court of Appeal, at paragraph 3 of its reasons in Kim v. Canada,[2] described the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme as follows:\nMr. Kim was employed by Bombardier Inc. and he reported employment income of $81,568 in 2009 and $85,568 in 2010. He also claimed business losses of $256,375 in 2009 and $114,848 in 2010. Mr. Kim\u2019s claim for business losses appears to have been based on information that he received from DSC Lifestyle Services. This organization was associated with the tax preparer known as \u201cFiscal Arbitrators\u201d. The claimed business losses appear to have been based on Mr. Kim\u2019s unrealistic notion that his employment income was linked to an artificial legal entity and that it was possible to distinguish between this artificial legal entity and a human being. He could therefore have his artificial entity pay his real entity expenses which resulted in the losses that he had claimed.\n[13] I found in Bradshaw v. The Queen[3] that the plan, as described by a representative of the Fiscal Arbitrators organization to Mr. Bradshaw, was patently absurd.\n[14] The DeMara scheme was described by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada v. Rattai[4] (\u201cRattai\u201d) at paragraph 1, as follows:\nDeMara Consulting Inc. (DeMara) promoted a program to clients (called members) under which DeMara prepared and filed income tax returns for members and their spouses. To become members, individuals were required to complete a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement and to provide DeMara with detailed personal information including about personal living expenses and personal debt\/financing obligations. DeMara used this information to prepare T5 and T5008 forms and then prepared members\u2019 returns deducting the personal expenses as business losses and treating them as capital losses. DeMara also required members to appoint DeMara as their authorized representative with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).\n[15] The principals of Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara were criminally convicted for their actions in preparing income tax returns for a large number of taxpayers in which the taxpayers claimed fictitious business losses.\n[16] The Minister has assessed hundreds of taxpayers for their participation in these schemes. The assessments denied the substantial fictitious business losses claimed by the taxpayers and imposed gross negligence penalties.\n[17] Beginning around 2010 and continuing for the next 9 or 10 years, approximately 1,000 of these taxpayers (including the 79 Appellants) appealed the assessments to this Court. In the early 2010s, most of the appeals involved Fiscal Arbitrators.\n[18] The taxpayers were located in all regions of the country. A large number of the appellants were self-represented before the Court.\n[19] As is the Court\u2019s practice when dealing with a large group of appellants who have participated in the same scheme or tax shelter, a case management judge was appointed to manage the appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara scheme.\n[20] Chief Justice Rip (as he then was) was the first case management judge for this group of appeals. My colleague, Justice Boyle, replaced Chief Justice Rip in late 2015. I then replaced Justice Boyle as case management judge in the fall of 2021.\n[21] At various times since the appeals were filed, the Court has issued orders holding the appeals in abeyance.\n[22] It appears that Chief Justice Rip issued the first Order on June 2, 2014. This Order applied to the appellant, Denis Anderson, docket 2010-3038(IT)G, and all other appellants listed in Schedule A to Chief Justice Rip\u2019s Order. Schedule A to the Order included 522 appellants.\n[23] Chief Justice Rip ordered that all 522 appeals and \u201cany future appeals having similar common or related questions of law or fact be stayed sine die.\u201d\n[24] The 522 appellants named in Chief Justice Rip\u2019s Order had participated in either the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme or the DeMara scheme. Therefore, the Order stayed all future appeals relating to either scheme.\n[25] The 522 appellants listed in Schedule A to the June 2, 2014 Order include 40 of the 79 Appellants. One other of the 79 Appellants was subject to a similar Order issued by Chief Justice Rip on June 24, 2014.\n[26] It appears that Justice Boyle issued similar orders. For example, on November 25, 2016, Justice Boyle issued an Order staying the appeal of Judy Davey, docket 2016\u20111701(IT)G, who is one of the 79 Appellants. The Order states that Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal and \u201cany future appeals having similar common or related questions of law or fact be stayed sine die.\u201d\n[27] As a result, the appeals of any of the 79 Appellants who were not specifically mentioned in an order of Chief Justice Rip or Justice Boyle were stayed since they were appeals with respect to the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara schemes.\n[28] Justice Boyle held a status hearing in Winnipeg in October of 2016 for 78 appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and\/or DeMara schemes (the \u201cOctober 2016 Status Hearing\u201d). Counsel for the 79 Appellants represented all of the 78 appellants.\n[29] During the status hearing, Justice Boyle noted that Chief Justice Rip, during his time as case management judge, had released a third of the appeals relating to the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme or the DeMara scheme from being held in abeyance. Justice Boyle noted that since becoming case management judge, he had released another third of the appeals from being held in abeyance.\n[30] He indicated that he intended to release the appeals of the appellants before him from abeyance that day and provide dates for the completion of the litigation steps.[5]\n[31] Counsel for the appellants then argued that only one appeal involving an appellant who had participated in the DeMara scheme should proceed and that the remaining appeals should be held in abeyance. He referred to the one appeal that should proceed as an informal lead case, since the decision in that appeal would not be binding on the other appeals.\n[32] He stated that his legal argument was the same for all of the 78 appellants who were before the Court and this argument was not dependent on the facts of a particular appeal. When asked whether all of the appellants were only involved with DeMara, he noted that the appellants were involved with both the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes, but that a significant portion were appellants involved only with DeMara.\n[33] Counsel for the appellants noted that all of the appellants were only challenging the gross negligence penalties; they were not challenging the underlying assessments.[6]\n[34] Counsel for the Respondent had reservations concerning the appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s suggested approach at that time. He noted that appeals, such as the ones before the Court, are fact-based, meaning that each case will turn on its own facts. The Respondent\u2019s position was that there was no need for lead cases. He also noted that there were dozens of cases involving the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes that had already been decided by this Court.\n[35] Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that it was a unique situation to have 78 appellants represented by the same counsel. While the Respondent would accept informal lead cases, he would not agree to be bound by the lead cases. He noted that the result in such informal lead cases may affect the Respondent\u2019s risk assessment with any subsequent cases. He also noted that while counsel was located in Winnipeg, the appellants before the Court were located across the country.\n[36] Counsel for the Respondent left it to the Court to decide how the Court wished to proceed, but wanted more than one test case so that the Court was presented with a \u201cgood cross section that is representative of the facts\u201d.[7]\n[37] Justice Boyle then gave the parties 30 days to come to an agreement on lead cases with respect to the 78 appellants. In a letter dated December 8, 2016,[8] the parties identified the appeals of three taxpayers: two appeals by Sandra McPherson, which related to both the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes; one appeal by Thor Choptiany, which related to the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme; and one appeal by Wayne Richter, which related to the DeMara scheme.\n[38] While the parties referred to the appeals of the three named taxpayers as lead cases, I will refer to them as \u201cinformal lead cases\u201d since they were not true lead cases. Lead cases are appeals in respect of which other appellants agree to be bound by the Court\u2019s finding in such appeals. The facts before me are that only one appellant agreed to be bound by the decision in the three informal lead cases. That appellant was Mr. Richter, who agreed that the decision in his informal lead case would determine the result in a second Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeal that he had before the Court. This makes sense since gross negligence looks to the actions of the appellant and Mr. Richter was the appellant in both appeals.\n[39] Justice Boyle issued an Order on January 11, 2017 (the \u201cJanuary 2017 Abeyance Order\u201d), setting out a timetable for the completion of the litigation steps in the informal lead cases, and ordering that all other matters listed in Schedule A to his Order be held in abeyance pending the decision in the (informal) lead cases.[9] There are 78 appeals listed in Schedule A to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. The schedule included appellants who appeared at the status hearing, plus four additional appeals.\n[40] In an Order dated October 5, 2022, Justice Boyle granted the appellants\u2019 motion in the informal lead cases, allowing their appeals and vacating the gross negligence penalties.[10] He found that \u201c[t]he Respondent has adopted and demonstrated a consistent pattern of non-compliance with this Court\u2019s Orders and Rules with respect to CRA\u2019s audits and investigations involving the Appellants.\u201d[11]\n[41] These non-compliances were in respect of the Respondent\u2019s discovery nominee\u2019s failure to properly inform himself with respect to whether the CRA had instigated criminal investigations into the three appellants in the informal lead cases, as well as the failure of the Respondent to comply with Justice Boyle\u2019s orders with respect to disclosure of CRA investigations, such as criminal investigations of each of the three appellants, including CRA projects where the appellants were mentioned.\n[42] Justice Boyle allowed the appeals under the Court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its process. In his reasons, my colleague emphasized that this is a remedy of last resort, but that the continuing failure of the Respondent to comply with the Rules of the Court and his orders justified allowing the appeals.\n[43] At the time that I became case management judge, only 60 appeals remained before the Court with respect to appellants who had only participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators scheme. Approximately 185 appeals were before the Court that related to the DeMara scheme, although some taxpayers participated in both schemes. The appellants in these appeals were located in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Kelowna, Lethbridge, Nelson, Regina, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Prince George, Toronto and Windsor.\n[44] Once I became case management judge, I decided to remove all of the outstanding appeals from abeyance, except for the appeals of the 78 appellants that were being held in abeyance under the January 2017 Abeyance Order and a number of DeMara-related appeals that the Court was holding in abeyance until such time as the Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision in Rattai.\n[45] Currently, none of the Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeals are being held in abeyance. I released the appeals subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order from abeyance once Justice Boyle issued his decision in Choptiany et al. in October of 2022, and I released the relevant DeMara appeals once the Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision in Rattai in June of 2022.\n[46] As previously noted, a case management conference was held on October 12, 2022 with respect to the 79 Appeals, which resulted in the 79 Appellants filing this motion.\nPosition of the Parties\n[47] Relying mainly on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v Jordan[12] (\u201cJordan\u201d), the Appellants argue that the 79 Appeals should be allowed because of a delay in the hearing of the appeals due to the actions of the Respondent in the informal lead cases.\n[48] The Appellants argue that the selection of the informal lead cases and the holding of the 79 Appeals in abeyance was ordered by the Court on the understanding that this would be the most just and expeditious means of resolving the group of appeals, whereby the decisions of the lead cases would negate the need for multiplicity of proceedings having regard to the Appellants\u2019 common arguments.\n[49] They argue that the delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals is unjustified and prejudicial and was caused by a serious abuse of the Court\u2019s processes. Counsel for the 79 Appellants argued that if the Appellants\u2019 motion is not granted, then the CRA, having lost the three informal lead appeals while gaining advantage in a hundred others, will be rewarded rather than punished for years-long abuse and games-playing.\n[50] In his written submissions, counsel for the 79 Appellants stated the following with respect to what would occur if I were to dismiss the motion before the Court: \u201cThis would be a repugnant result, effectively overturning the immensely important ruling of this court in Choptiany thereby bringing the integrity of this court into disrepute.\u201d\n[51] This is not an acceptable statement or argument to make before this Court. It is disrespectful. The fact that the Court\u2019s decision is not the decision that the Appellants hoped for is not repugnant and does not bring the integrity of the Court into disrepute. It is a decision that is based upon the facts in front of me and the applicable law.\n[52] Counsel for the 79 Appellants seems to have forgotten that he is an officer of the Court. He must not make disrespectful statements that question the integrity and competence of the Court.\n[53] The Respondent raises a number of arguments in support of his position that the motion should be dismissed:\n-An appeal held in abeyance is an inactive appeal that inherently involves delay. This delay was the result of the Appellants requesting the appeals to be held in abeyance.\n-With the exception of a second appeal by one of the Appellants in the informal lead cases, the Court\u2019s decision in Choptiany et al. was never intended to be dispositive of the 79 Appeals. The determination of whether an individual taxpayer is liable for the subsection 163(2) gross negligence penalty is dependent on the conduct of the individual taxpayer. As a result, the appeals are fact-based and each case will turn on its own facts.\n-With the exception of the one appeal, the Respondent never agreed to be bound by the decision in the lead cases. This was made clear to the Court and the Appellants. The parties did not agree that any decision in the informal lead cases would negate the need for more litigation.\n-Delay on its own is not sufficient to allow these appeals. The delay must result in an abuse of the Court\u2019s process.\n-The Jordan principle is not applicable here\u2014that case is about the right of any person charged with a criminal offence to be tried within a reasonable period of time pursuant to section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Its application is limited to criminal law.\n-The Respondent did not maliciously or abusively delay the 79 Appeals. The Appellants offer no support for their allegation that the Respondent lost the lead appeals to gain an advantage in hundreds of others; the delay has no benefit to the Respondent.\n-The abuse found in Choptiany et al. was not abuse in these appeals. The Respondent has gained no advantage as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in the Choptiany et al. appeals and has not abused the discovery process in these appeals. On the contrary, two of the Appellants have previously filed joint applications for hearing in their appeals, certifying that their appeals are ready for trial.[13]\nDisposition of Motion\nA. Preliminary Issues\n[54] Four of the 79 appeals named in this motion were not subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. In particular, the appeals of Judy Davey, docket 2016\u20111701(IT)G; Heath Avery, docket 2016\u20115256(IT)G; Armin Mantei, docket 2016-3988(IT)G; and Michael Brouwer, docket 2019-614(IT)G were not subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order.\n[55] It is not clear to the Court how three of these appeals relate to the 78 appeals that were held in abeyance pursuant to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. The Appellants filed no factual information with respect to any of the four noted appeals.\n[56] The Court\u2019s file for the Davey appeal indicates the following:\n-Ms. Davey lives in British Columbia, and was self-represented at the time that Justice Boyle issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on November 25, 2016 holding her appeal in abeyance.\n-Her appeal appears to have been removed from abeyance shortly thereafter since, on May 3, 2017, the Appellant and the Respondent jointly submitted a timetable for the completion of the litigation steps.\n-The Court issued a timetable Order on May 31, 2017.\n-Ms. Davey retained the Rotfleisch & Samulovitch law firm around July 24, 2017.\n-On July 25, 2017, the parties filed a request to amend the Court\u2019s May 31, 2017 timetable Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on August 11, 2017, amending its previous timetable Order.\n-The Court issued an Order on September 28, 2018, holding the appeal in abeyance.\n[57] Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal was clearly active after the January 2017 Abeyance Order. This is a different situation than the situation of appellants subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal appeared to be proceeding in a normal manner until the Court\u2019s abeyance Order in September 2018.\n[58] Counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or even argument to explain why Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal should be included with the appeals that were subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order. For these reasons, the motion, as it applies to Ms. Davey\u2019s appeal, docket 2016-1701(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[59] The Court\u2019s file for the Avery appeal indicates the following:\n-Mr. Avery is located in British Columbia and was represented by counsel in British Columbia at the time that he filed his notice of appeal.\n-On May 25, 2017, the parties jointly submitted a timetable for the completion of litigation steps.\n-The Court issued a timetable Order on May 31, 2017 and a revised Order on December 11, 2017.\n-The Court file indicates that the parties completed most litigation steps, including examinations for discovery.\n-On October 16, 2018, Justice Boyle issued an Order adjourning the scheduling of the hearing of the appeal until the Court issued its judgment in five appeals that were then before the Court. These five appeals included the Rattai appeal, but did not include the informal lead cases.\n-On May 23, 2019, the Court set the appeal down to be heard on March 23, 2020 in Victoria. The hearing of the appeal was adjourned to allow the Appellant to retain new counsel.\n[60] This is another appeal that was clearly proceeding to hearing after the Court issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order. In fact, it was scheduled for hearing on two occasions.\n[61] Since counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or argument to explain why Mr. Avery\u2019s appeal should be included with the appeals that were subject to the January 2017 Abeyance Order, the motion, as it applies to Mr. Avery\u2019s appeal, docket 2016-5256(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[62] The Court\u2019s file for the Brouwer appeal indicates that the notice of appeal was filed on February 5, 2019, two years after the January 2017 Abeyance Order. Since counsel for the Appellants has provided no facts or argument to explain how an appeal filed two years after the January 2017 Abeyance Order relates to the appeals subject to that Order, the motion, as it applies to Mr. Brouwer\u2019s appeal, docket 2019\u2011614(IT)G, is dismissed.\n[63] The appeal with respect to Armin Mantei was filed on September 28, 2016. On June 29, 2017, the Appellant was informed that his appeal would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the informal lead cases. Since this occurred approximately five months after the Court issued the January 2017 Abeyance Order, it is self-evident that it should be treated in the same manner as the appeals of the 79 Appellants.\n[64] After this motion was filed by the 79 Appellants, a Consent to Judgment was filed in one of the appeals named in this motion \u2013 the appeal of Wayne Richter, docket 2018-4215(IT)G. As noted previously, Mr. Richter agreed to be bound by the decision in the informal lead cases. As a result, the motion as it applies to Mr. Richter\u2019s appeal is moot and is dismissed.\n[65] Subsequent to the filing of this motion, the appeals of Joseph Caro, docket 2013-4053(IT)G; Thomas Bastien, docket 2013-4228(IT)G; and Henry De Boon 2014-957(IT)G were discontinued. The motion as it applies to these three appeals is moot and is dismissed.\nB. The Remaining Appellants\n[66] I will now address the motion as it applies to the remaining Appellants. My reasons apply equally to the Davey, Avery and Brouwer appeals. For simplicity, I will continue to refer to the appeals as the 79 Appeals and the Appellants as the 79 Appellants. However, my reasons that follow do not apply to the Richter appeal, the Caro appeal, the Bastien appeal and the De Boon appeal.\n[67] In R. v. Cunningham,[14] Rothstein J. wrote for the Supreme Court of Canada:\n[18] Superior courts possess inherent jurisdiction to ensure they can function as courts of law and fulfil their mandate to administer justice (see I. H. Jacob, \u201cThe Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court\u201d (1970), 23 Curr. Legal Probs. 23, at pp. 27\u201128). Inherent jurisdiction includes the authority to control the process of the court, prevent abuses of process, and ensure the machinery of the court functions in an orderly and effective manner. ...\n[19] Likewise in the case of statutory courts, the authority to control the court\u2019s process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law. This Court has affirmed that courts can apply a \u201cdoctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication\u201d when determining the powers of a statutory tribunal:\n. . . the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime . ...\n(ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 51)\nAlthough Bastarache J. was referring to an administrative tribunal, the same rule of jurisdiction, by necessary implication, would apply to statutory courts.\n[68] The Tax Court of Canada is both a superior court and a statutory court. As set out by Rothstein J., the Court possesses inherent and implied jurisdiction to control the process of the Court and prevent abuses of process.\n[69] This Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have noted on numerous occasions that the allowing of an appeal by a motions judge on the basis of an abuse of process is a drastic step. As the Federal Court of Canada, Appeal Division noted in Yacyshyn v. Canada at paragraph 18, \u201c\u2026the dismissal of an appeal is a drastic and somewhat ultimate remedy reserved for the egregious case or when no other alternative and less dramatic remedy would be adequate.\u201d This statement applies equally to the allowing of an appeal on account of the conduct of the Respondent.[15]\n[70] In my view, the current situation does not constitute an egregious case that justifies allowing the 79 Appeals. In fact, for the following reasons, the actions of the Respondent in Choptiany et al. do not in any way support the allowing of the 79 Appeals.\n[71] In the first instance, I find that the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the Choptiany et al. appeals is not an abuse of process with respect to the 79 Appeals.\n[72] The abuse of process in the Choptiany et al. appeals arose as a result of the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the examination for discovery of its nominee in the informal lead cases. This related to the disclosure of factual evidence in respect of the three appellants in the informal lead cases, and in particular, factual questions with respect to criminal investigations of the three appellants. This has no relevance to the 79 Appeals.\n[73] Further, the Appellants have produced no evidence to show that the abuse that occurred at the discovery stage in the Choptiany et al. appeals relates to any discovery that has occurred in the 79 Appeals. In fact, it appears from the record that discovery has not occurred in most of the 79 Appeals.\n[74] The only issue is whether the Respondent caused a delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals and whether such a delay constitutes an abuse of process.\n[75] The Appellants rely heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Jordan. As previously noted, this decision relates to an accused charged with a criminal offence, and the right to be tried within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Jordan decision is not relevant to appeals made under the Income Tax Act.\n[76] The Appellants argue that a substantial delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals occurred because a decision in the informal lead cases would have negated the need for proceeding in the 79 Appeals. The Appellants produced no factual evidence to support this claim.\n[77] In fact, the evidence before the Court supports the Respondent\u2019s factual assertion that the informal lead cases were never intended to be dispositive of the 79 Appeals. The Respondent made it clear prior to the appeals being held in abeyance that he would not agree to be bound by the Court\u2019s decision in the informal lead cases.\n[78] More importantly, the determination of a taxpayer\u2019s liability under subsection 163(2) for the gross negligence penalty is dependent on the facts in each particular appeal.\n[79] Subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty on every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a tax return.\n[80] As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Wynter v. Canada,[16] subsection 163(2) imposes a penalty either when the taxpayer has knowledge, or in circumstances amounting to gross negligence.\n[81] The knowledge requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer had an actual intent to make a false statement or the taxpayer is wilfully blind. The Federal Court of Appeal explained that:\nA taxpayer is wilfully blind in circumstances where the taxpayer becomes aware of the need for inquiry but declines to make the inquiry because the taxpayer does not want to know, or studiously avoids, the truth. The concept is one of deliberate ignorance\u2026\n\u2026wilful blindness pivots on a finding that the taxpayer deliberately chose not to make inquiries in order to avoid verifying that which might be such an inconvenient truth. The essential factual element is a finding of deliberate ignorance, as it \u201cconnotes \u2018an actual process of suppressing a suspicion\u2019\u201d \u2026\n[82] The Federal Court of Appeal noted that gross negligence is distinct from wilful blindness. Gross negligence \u201c\u2026arises where the taxpayer\u2019s conduct is found to fall markedly below what would be expected of a reasonable taxpayer.\u201d[17]\n[83] The key issue in the 79 Appeals is the determination of the application of subsection 163(2) to each of the 79 Appellants; this determination requires an inquiry into the knowledge, intention and conduct of the each appellant. As the Respondent correctly noted, it is a fact-based determination and each appeal will turn on its own facts. The facts in the informal lead cases would not be determinative of the application of subsection 163(2) to the 79 Appellants.\n[84] The Choptiany et al. appeals highlighted the fact-specific nature of subsection 163(2) appeals. They were dismissed because of issues with respect to the discovery of facts that were specific to each of the three appellants, namely criminal investigations of each of the appellants.\n[85] As noted, the Respondent clearly stated during the October 2016 Status Hearing that he would not be bound by the informal lead cases.\n[86] During the October 2016 Status Hearing, counsel for the Appellants appears to state that if he loses the informal lead cases, he will not pursue the other appeals. He noted that he had no intention of conducting 65 separate trials since his argument was identical in each of the appeals.[18] It is not clear whether he was speaking for himself or for the 79 Appellants.\n[87] Further, the Appellants have produced no evidence to support their claim that there was a delay in the hearing of the 79 Appeals that was unjustified and prejudicial. They put no factual evidence before the Court.\n[88] In the last few years, large group appeals, such as the one before the Court, have become a common occurrence. In many instances, the group appeals involve thousands of appellants. It is simply impossible for the Court to hear all of these appeals at the same time.\n[89] In order to ensure that the Court functions in an orderly and efficient manner, the Court has instituted procedures to manage such appeals, taking into account the resources of the Court; the fact that the Court is a transient court that travels across the country; and the fact that the appellants, in most group appeals, are located in all regions of the country. The Court\u2019s procedures ensure that each appellant is treated fairly and is provided with the opportunity to have their day in court.\n[90] This is what occurred with the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara appeals. The Court first held all of the appeals in abeyance. This allowed the Court to determine the number and nature of the related appeals. At the time of the October 2016 Status Hearing, approximately two-thirds of the Fiscal Arbitrators\/DeMara appeals had been released from being held in abeyance.\n[91] Prior to the October 2016 Status Hearing, the Court heard and decided numerous appeals with respect to the application of subsection 163(2) to appellants who had participated in the Fiscal Arbitrators and DeMara schemes. The Federal Court of Appeal also heard and decided appeals with respect to each of these schemes.\n[92] This allowed jurisprudence to be developed with respect to the underlying transactions and the various positions that the appellants were taking with respect to the application of subsection 163(2) to their fact-specific situations. As counsel for the Respondent noted, the jurisprudence from these decisions allows the Respondent to conduct a risk assessment with respect to any subsequent appeals. This would apply equally to appellants in such appeals.\n[93] At the October 2016 Status Hearing, Justice Boyle informed the parties that his intention was to remove from abeyance the appeals of the 78 appellants before him and to provide dates for the completion of litigation steps, which would have allowed the appeals to proceed to being heard by the Court.\n[94] The Appellant\u2019s counsel did not want this approach, but rather chose to proceed with informal lead cases and to delay the hearing of the 79 Appeals. Informal lead cases that would not be binding on the Respondent or on the 79 Appellants and would not be determinative of the 79 Appeals, since each of these appeals will be determined based on the particular facts of the appeal.\n[95] Since the Court\u2019s decision in the informal lead cases would not be determinative of the 79 Appeals, such appeals would have continued to hearing regardless of the Court\u2019s judgment in the informal lead cases.\n[96] In such a situation, the Respondent\u2019s actions in the informal lead cases did not constitute an abuse of process with respect to the 79 Appeals.\n[97] The Appellants argue that the Respondent, by his actions in the Choptiany et al. appeals, has gained an advantage in a hundred other appeals. It is not clear to the Court what constitutes this advantage. The Appellants have offered no evidence to support this allegation. As previously noted, each appeal is fact\u2011specific. Further, the Respondent bears the burden of proof to establish the facts supporting the assessment of a penalty under subsection 163(2) against each of the 79 Appellants. In such a situation, it is difficult to see how the disclosure of facts in the informal lead cases conferred an advantage on the Respondent.\n[98] For the foregoing reasons, the motion of the 79 Appellants is dismissed, with costs.\n[99] It is time for the 79 Appellants to proceed to a hearing of their appeals.

BACCHUS,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nTRANSCRIPT OF THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nSmith J.\n[1] I will now deliver my reasons for judgment in this appeal.\n[2] This matter involves an appeal made by the Appellant, Wayne Bacchus, from notices of reassessment made by the Minister of National Revenue in respect of the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2014 taxation years.\n[3] Mr. Bacchus was initially assessed as filed for those years but the Minister later reassessed him to disallow donation tax credits claimed pursuant to subsection 118.1(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985,c.1 (5th Supp.) in respect of his participation in the Global Learning Gifting Initiative, also known as GLGI (the \u201cGLGI Program\u201d).\n[4] It is not disputed that he claimed the following amounts, in addition to carry-forwards from previous years for 2006, 2007, 2013 and 2014:\n2005\n2006\n2009\n2012\nCash donation\n$3,000\n$3,000\n$5,000\n$5,000\nGift-in-kind\n$15,000\n$15,000\n$25,000\n$30,000\nTotal\n$18,000\n$18,000\n$30,000\n$35,000\n[5] The Appellant challenged the Minister\u2019s disallowance of his cash donations. In particular, he alleged that the process by which the reassessments were established was unfair in that CRA failed to interview him to determine his subjective intent to donate and unfairly extrapolated from the subjective donative intent of other participants in the GLGI Program. He argued that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[6] At the commencement of the hearing, the Respondent brought a motion to strike the Notice of Appeal, arguing that the Minister\u2019s conduct was not relevant and that the issue before the Court was the correctness of the reassessments.\n[7] Having heard the representations of the parties, the Court struck the offending paragraphs without actually striking the Notice of Appeal, indicating that that it was prepared to hear the Appellant\u2019s evidence and arguments on the issue of his donative intent for the cash donations.\n[8] As framed by the Appellant himself, the issue in this appeal is whether he is entitled to donation tax credits for the cash donations, as described above.\n[9] In the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, the Minister made a number of factual assumptions that I would summarize as follows:\na)The GLGI Program was set up as a tax shelter that was promoted on the basis that participants would be entitled to receive tax credits equal to 56 \u2013 112% of their cash donation;\nb)Participants were entitled to become capital beneficiaries of a trust and, upon acceptance, would be entitled to receive educational courseware that would then be donated to the charities;\nc)Participants were automatically approved as capital beneficiaries but did not take possession of the courseware. In any event, courseware had no value;\nd)Participants received tax receipts reflecting the value of the cash donation and alleged value of the courseware. Since the courseware had no value, the receipt for the gift-in kind was in fact an inflated tax receipt.\n[10] The Minister took the position that participants in the GLGI Program did not have donative intent because they made cash donations to obtain tax credits that exceeded the value of their cash donation. Accordingly, they actually intended to profit from their cash donation. In the end, all participants relied upon inflated donation receipts since the courseware had no value.\nI. The Evidence\n[11] The Appellant testified on his own behalf. There were no other witnesses.\n[12] At the relevant time, he was working independently as a lawyer. Although he had previously claimed charitable donations of $25 to $100, he had also participated in various charitable activities and donated a substantial amount of time and energy or what he referred to as \u201csweat equity\u201d.\n[13] He was introduced to the GLGI Program by his insurance agent whom he knew and considered as a friend. He attended his office where he was introduced to a promoter who explained the GLGI Program and provided him with some documentation that he took home to review with his spouse.\n[14] He was initially skeptical but conducted some due diligence and online research to determine if the charities and escrow agents were legitimate. He concluded that they were. He understood that if he made a cash donation, he would be entitled to valuable courseware. As a business-minded individual seeking to get ahead in life for himself and his family, he contemplated how he might take advantage of this opportunity. He later concluded that he had no contractual right to the courseware and that it was best to simply donate it to the charities.\n[15] The Appellant adduced a series of receipts to support his cash donations and argued that he should be entitled to donation tax credits for those amounts because, subjectively, he had donative intent when the donations were made. He argued that he did not knowingly participate in the GLGI Program and that he had been \u201cscammed\u201d by his insurance agent.\n[16] In cross-examinations, Mr. Bacchus acknowledged he had studied in a 2 year accounting program and later completed a law degree. He admitted that GLGI was described to him as a way to give to charity and potentially get an advantage. He understood that GLGI was a tax shelter, that he would get a tax break and save money and admitted he was looking for an advantage. He could not recall any informational brochure or suggestion of a cash-flow advantage.\nII. Analysis\n[17] Having considered the evidence, the Court finds that the Appellant has not established a prima facie case that the Minister\u2019s assumptions were incorrect.\n[18] In particular, the Court finds that the Appellant received the informational brochures describing the GLGI Program that he then reviewed with his spouse. Given his legal and accounting background, the Court finds that he understood there would be a cash-flow advantage in that the value of the courseware would exceed the amount of his cash donation by a ratio of 5:1.\n[19] The Court finds that the Appellant understood that his participation would allow him to receive tax refunds that exceeded the value of his cash donation. Even if the Court accepts that he was initially sceptical, those concerns quickly dissipated as he agreed to participate in the GLGI Program over several years.\n[20] The Court notes that in each year he participated, he signed several documents. This included the application to be approved as a capital beneficiary of the trust, the deed of gift of the cash amount as well as the deed of gift of property. In the latter document, he declared that \u201che was the sole and exclusive legal and beneficial owner in possession and control of the educational software\u201d and wished to \u201cirrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally gift it to the Charity.\u201d\n[21] The Appellant chose to believe that the courseware had value based on the alleged valuations. Regrettably, that turned out to be false and the actual fair market value was at best nominal. There has been no evidence to the contrary.\n[22] As noted above, the Appellant claims that subjectively, he had the necessary donative intent when the cash donations were made.\n[23] As stated by Justice Iacobucci in Symes v. The Queen [1993] 4 SCR 695 (para. 74) \u2013 and I quote - where \u201cpurpose or intention behind actions is to be ascertained, it must not be supposed that in responding to this question courts will be guided only by a taxpayer\u2019s statement ex post facto or otherwise, as to the subjective purpose of a particular expenditure. Courts will, instead, look for objective manifestation of purpose, and purpose is ultimately a question of fact to be decided with due regard for all of the circumstances.\u201d\n[24] When considering the objective manifestation of purpose in this instance, the Court finds that the Appellant intended to make the cash donations because of his expectation that he would be entitled to educational courseware valued at 5 times his cash donation. In the end, he chose to put aside his doubts because the alleged donation of the courseware to the charities would allow him to obtain a tax refund that exceeded the value of the cash donation.\n[25] As noted by the Respondent, the Income Tax Act does not define a \u201cgift\u201d but the term has been described in the case law as \u201ca gratuitous transfer of property that is not made in exchange for a financial advantage or benefit\u201d. A necessary element of a gift includes impoverishment for the benefit of a qualified donee. If any of these elements are lacking, donative intent will be vitiated.\n[26] In this instance, despite the fact that the Appellant is clearly out of pocket the cash donations, the Court finds that he did not intend to impoverish himself because the GLGI Program was designed to allow him to obtain tax credits that exceeded the amount of his cash donation.\n[27] The description of the GLGI Program leaves little doubt that the Appellant \u2013 along with thousands of other Canadians - participated in an arrangement involving a series of predetermined and interconnected steps. By agreeing to participate and in making the initial cash donation, they were automatically entitled to receive courseware that was allegedly valued at 5 times the value of the cash outlay. This is problematic because the established definition of a \u201cgift\u201d implies that the donor has not received a financial advantage or benefit.\n[28] In Mariano v. The Queen, 2015 TCC 244 (\u201cMariano\u201d), this Court heard evidence and conducted a thorough review of the GLGI Program. It concluded that the alleged gifts failed because of the financial advantage received by participants. It also concluded that the courseware had no market value. This Court is bound by the Mariano decision based on principles of judicial comity as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19 (para. 24).\n[29] The Appellant has not distinguished his personal situation from the taxpayers in Mariano but he claims he should be entitled to claim his cash donation.\n[30] However, in Mar\u00e9chaux v. The Queen, 2009 TCC 587, Kossow v. the Queen, 2012 TCC 325 and Markou v. The Queen, 2018 TCC 66, this Court concluded that it was not possible to split donations made as part of an arrangement involving a series of predetermined and interconnected steps. These decisions stand for the proposition that it is not possible to consider the cash donations in isolation.\n[31] This was confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal. In Mar\u00e9chaux v. Canada, 2010 FCA 287 (para. 12), it agreed with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that if there is just one interconnected transaction, no part of it can be considered a gift.\n[32] Similarly, in Makou v. Canada, 2019 FCA 299 (para. 60), it concluded that \u201cwhere a person anticipates receiving tax benefits that exceed the amount or value of an alleged gift, the donative intent is necessarily lacking. Impoverishment being an essential element of a gift under both the civil law and common law, and thus the purported gift constituted by the cash contribution would fail on this account as well.\u201d This disposes of the arguments made by the Appellant.\nIII. Conclusion\n[33] The Court adds that it is not a court of equity and as such, it cannot make decisions based on fairness or equitable considerations.\n[34] It also has no jurisdiction to waive interest or penalties where properly applied. To the extent that interest has accumulated over several years, the Appellant is entitled to seek relief under the Taxpayer Relief Program managed by the Canada Revenue Agency and, if necessary, seek judicial review of the Minister\u2019s decisions before the Federal Court.\n[35] The appeal is therefore dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 8th day of May 2024.\n\u201cGuy R.

D\u2019Arcy\u201d\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nCitation: 2024TCC63\nDate: 20240509\nDocket: 2021-1079(IT)G\nBETWEEN:\nDAC INVESTMENT HOLDINGS INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nD\u2019Arcy J.\nIntroduction\n[1] Prior to April 29, 2015, the Appellant was taxed on its worldwide income under the taxing regime for a Canadian-controlled private corporation (\u201cCCPC\u201d). On April 29, 2015, it continued in a foreign jurisdiction such that it was deemed to be incorporated outside of Canada; however, it remained a resident of Canada, taxed on its worldwide income. Since the Appellant was not considered to be incorporated in Canada, it was no longer taxed on its worldwide income under the taxing regime for CCPCs, but rather was taxed under the regime for private corporations that were not CCPCs and that were not Canadian corporations. As a result, a host of provisions in the Act ceased to apply to the Appellant, provisions that were not previously applied began to apply to the Appellant, and other provisions applied to the Appellant in a different manner.\n[2] One provision that ceased to apply was section 123.3 of the Income Tax Act[1] (the \u201cAct\u201d), which levies the 10 2\/3% refundable tax on a CCPC\u2019s investment income.\n[3] Another provision that ceased to apply was paragraph (b) of the definition of full rate taxable income in subsection 123.4(1). This meant that the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the 13% general rate reduction provided for in subsection 123.4(2) was now determined under paragraph (a) of the definition of full rate taxable income. As a result, the Appellant was now entitled to claim the 13% general rate reduction in respect of its investment income.\n[4] The Minister applied the general anti-avoidance rule (the \u201cGAAR\u201d) and assessed the Appellant on the basis that its investment income was subject to the section 123.3 refundable tax and that it was not entitled to claim the section 123.4 general rate reduction in respect of its investment income.\n[5] The Appellant challenges the application of the GAAR.\n[6] The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts and a Supplemental Agreed Statement of Facts[2] (jointly referred to as the \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d). There were no witnesses called at the hearing. The parties attached a number of exhibits to the agreed statement of facts. The agreed statement of facts (without the appendices) is attached as \u201cAppendix A\u201d to these Reasons for Judgment.\nRelevant Facts\n[7] The Appellant was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario)[3] on September 11, 2001.\n[8] Since the inception of the Appellant, Mr. David Civiero has been its sole director and has held directly or indirectly at least 50% of its common shares. From 2015 through 2019, Mr. Civiero was the sole common shareholder of the Appellant. At all material times, Mr. Civiero resided in Ontario.\n[9] On or around October 22, 2011, Mr. Civiero acquired common shares of Soberlink Inc. He purchased additional shares of Soberlink Inc. on, or around, June 26, 2013. On or around December 31, 2013, Mr. Civiero transferred all of his common shares of Soberlink (the \u201cSoberlink Shares\u201d) to Jacal Holdings Ltd. (\u201cJacal\u201d). Since December 11, 1996, Mr. Civiero has been the sole director and has held all of the shares of Jacal.\n[10] The following occurred after Mr. Civiero transferred the Soberlink Shares to Jacal:\n-On October 3, 2014, Soberlink Inc. received a non-binding indication of interest from a potential buyer;\n-On April 14, 2015, the Appellant acquired the Soberlink Shares from Jacal pursuant to a section 85 \u201crollover\u201d transaction. On this date, the Appellant\u2019s only assets were the Soberlink Shares;\n-On April 15, 2015, Soberlink\u2019s CEO informed Mr. Civiero that the sale of a division of Soberlink was close to completion. In order to effect this sale, the Soberlink Shares would be sold to a third party;\n-On April 29, 2015, the Appellant was continued into the British Virgin Islands. As a result of the continuance, the Appellant\u2019s 2015 taxation year ended on April 28, 2015;\n-At all relevant times following the Appellant\u2019s continuance, the Appellant\u2019s central management and control remained in Ontario, Canada;\n-On May 14, 2015, the Appellant sold the Soberlink Shares to an arm\u2019s-length party and realized a capital gain in the amount of $2,359,295;\n-The Appellant reported a taxable capital gain of $1,179,648 on its tax return for its taxation year ending on April 30, 2016 (the \u201c2016 taxation year\u201d). The Appellant reported no other income on its tax return other than a foreign exchange gain; and\n-The Appellant filed this tax return on the basis that, during the 2016 taxation year, the Appellant:\nwas a corporation resident in Canada, subject to tax on its worldwide income under the Act;\nwas a \u201cprivate corporation\u201d as that term is defined in subsection 89(1) of the Act; and\nwas not a CCPC under the Act.\n[11] The Minister applied the GAAR when reassessing the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year. Specifically, the Minister, when reassessing the Appellant:\n-assessed refundable tax of $91,003 under section 123.3 of the Act on the basis that the Appellant was a CCPC; and\n-denied the general reduction of $148,216 claimed by the Appellant under section 123.4 of the Act.\nThe Law\n[12] The leading cases on the how the GAAR is to be applied are the Supreme Court of Canada (the \u201cSCC\u201d) decisions in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada[4] (\u201cCanada Trustco\u201d), Lipson v. Canada[5] (\u201cLipson\u201d), Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada[6] (\u201cCopthorne\u201d), Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.[7] (\u201cAlta Energy\u201d) and Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada[8] (\u201cDeans Knight\u201d).[9]\n[13] In Copthorne and Deans Knight, the SCC set out how the provisions of section 245 that impose the GAAR are to be applied to a transaction or a series of transactions. The Court\u2019s reasoning in Copthorne and Deans Knight is consistent with its reasoning in its decisions in Canada Trustco, Lipson, and Alta Energy.\n[14] In its decisions, the SCC has made a number of observations with respect to the application of the GAAR, including the following:\n-The GAAR is different from the other provisions of the Act. While the Act is dominated by \u201cexplicit provisions dictating specific consequences\u201d that invite a largely textual interpretation, the GAAR is \u201cquite a different sort of provision\u201d. It is a \u201cbroadly drafted provision, intended to negate arrangements that would be permissible under a literal interpretation of other provisions of the Income Tax Act, on the basis that they amount to abusive tax avoidance.\u201d[10]\n-The GAAR was enacted \u201cas a provision of last resort\u201d.[11]\n-The SCC has affirmed on numerous occasions the Duke of Westminster principle that taxpayers can order their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable.[12] However, this principle \u201chas never been absolute\u201d[13]. Where a transaction or series of transactions is shown to be abusive, the Duke of Westminster principle is \u201c\u2018attenuated\u2019 by the GAAR\u201d.[14]\n-A general rule such as the GAAR introduces a degree of uncertainty in tax planning. A proper application of the GAAR methodology limits the amount of uncertainty.[15] Further, this uncertainty\u201cunderlines the obligation of the Minister who wishes to overcome the countervailing obligations of consistency and predictability to demonstrate clearly the abuse he alleges.\u201d[16]\n[15] The SCC has set out three steps to be followed in determining the applicability of the GAAR. Those steps consist in ascertaining:\nwhether there is a \u201ctax benefit\u201d arising from a \u201ctransaction\u201d under subsections 245(1) and (2);\nwhether the transaction is an avoidance transaction under subsection 245(3), in the sense of not being \u201carranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit\u201d; and\nwhether the avoidance transaction is abusive under subsection 245(4).[17]\n[16] If there is more than one tax benefit, the court conducts a GAAR analysis for each tax benefit.[18]\n[17] All three requirements must be fulfilled. The burden is on the taxpayer to refute (1) and (2) and on the Minister to establish (3).[19]\n[18] The SCC has recognized that the line between legitimate tax minimization and abusive tax avoidance is far from bright.[20] If the existence of abusive tax avoidance is unclear, the benefit of the doubt goes to the taxpayer.[21]\nWas there a tax benefit?\n[19] During the relevant period, the definition of tax benefit in subsection 245(1) read as follows:\n\u201ctax benefit\u201d means a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act, and includes a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount that would be payable under this Act but for a tax treaty or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act as a result of a tax treaty.\n[20] Whether a tax benefit exists is a question of fact.[22] When determining whether a tax benefit exists, the magnitude of the tax benefit is irrelevant.[23] The determination may require a comparison of the taxpayer\u2019s situation with an alternative arrangement.[24]\n[21] When assessing the Appellant, the Minister assumed that the Appellant had received a tax benefit as a result of section 123.3 not being applicable and section 123.4 being applicable in the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year. The Appellant, in paragraph 28 of the agreed statement of facts, concedes these two tax benefits. The Respondent did not argue that the Appellant received any other tax benefits.\n[22] The position of the Appellant and the Respondent is consistent with the facts before me. Therefore, I accept the parties\u2019 position that the only tax benefits realized by the Appellant from the transactions at issue arose as a result of section 123.3 not being applicable and section 123.4 being applicable in the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year. Paragraph 29 of the agreed statement of facts states that the quantum of the tax benefits realized by the Appellant is computed in accordance with the chart at Appendix \u201cB\u201d of the agreed statement of facts. This chart is attached as \u201cAppendix B\u201d to these Reasons for Judgment.\nWere the transactions at issue avoidance transactions?\n[23] Avoidance transaction is defined in subsection 245(3) to mean any transaction:\n(a) that, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit; or\n(b) that is part of a series of transactions, which series, but for this section, would result, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, unless the transaction may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain the tax benefit.\n[24] The definition removes from the application of the GAAR transactions or series of transactions that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for a non-tax purpose.[25] As noted in Copthorne, \u201c[a]n avoidance transaction may operate alone to produce a tax benefit, or may operate as part of a series of transactions which produces a tax benefit\u201d.[26]\n[25] Similar to the determination of whether a tax benefit exists, the determination of whether a transaction (or a series of transactions) is an avoidance transaction is a question of fact.[27]\n[26] If a transaction has both tax and non-tax purposes, then the GAAR will not apply to the transaction if the non-tax purpose was primary.[28]\n[27] The SCC explained in Copthorne how one applies subsection 245(3) to a series a transactions, as follows:\nWhere, as here, the Minister assumes that the tax benefit resulted from a series of transactions rather than a single transaction, it is necessary to determine if there was a series, which transactions make up the series, and whether the tax benefit resulted from the series. If there is a series that results, directly or indirectly, in a tax benefit, it will be caught by s. 245(3) unless each transaction within the series could \u201creasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged primarily for bona fide purposes other than to obtain [a] tax benefit\u201d. If any transaction within the series is not undertaken primarily for a bona fide non-tax purpose that transaction will be an avoidance transaction.[29]\n[28] When applying the GAAR, the Minister treated the rollover of the Soberlink Shares from Jacal to the Appellant and the continuance of the Appellant into the British Virgin Islands on April 29, 2015 as avoidance transactions. The Appellant concedes at paragraph 30 of the agreed statement of facts that the two transactions were avoidance transactions.\n[29] On the basis of the facts before me, I accept that the two transactions are the only avoidance transactions.\n[30] As the SCC noted in Alta Energy, citing Canada Trustco and Lipson, tax avoidance is not tax evasion. Further, \u201c... tax avoidance should not be conflated with abuse. Even if a transaction was designed for a tax avoidance purpose and not for a bona fide non-tax purpose, such as an economic or commercial purpose, it does not mean that it is necessarily abusive within the meaning of the GAAR\u201d.[30]\n[31] The GAAR will only apply if the avoidance transaction is found to be abusive. As stated by the SCC, \u201c\u2026 [a] finding that a bona fide non-tax purpose is lacking, taken alone, should not be considered conclusive evidence of abusive tax avoidance.\u201d[31]\nAre the avoidance transactions abusive under subsection 245(4)?\n[32] Subsection 245(4) reads as follows:\nSubsection (2) applies to a transaction only if it may reasonably be considered that the transaction\n(a) would, if this Act were read without reference to this section, result directly or indirectly in a misuse of the provisions of any one or more of\n(i) this Act,\n(ii) the Income Tax Regulations,\n(iii) the Income Tax Application Rules,\n(iv) a tax treaty, or\n(v) any other enactment that is relevant in computing tax or any other amount payable by or refundable to a person under this Act or in determining any amount that is relevant for the purposes of that computation; or\n(b) would result directly or indirectly in an abuse having regard to those provisions, other than this section, read as a whole.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[33] Although subsection 245(4) refers to determinations of \u201cmisuse\u201d and \u201cabuse\u201d, the SCC has made it clear that there is no distinction between an \u201cabuse\u201d and a \u201cmisuse\u201d. The SCC has stated the following: \u201cSection 245(4) requires a single, unified approach to the textual, contextual and purposive interpretation of the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act that are relied upon by the taxpayer in order to determine whether there was abusive tax avoidance.\u201d[32] As a result, I will only use the term \u201cabuse\u201d.\n[34] The determination of whether a transaction is an abuse of the Act involves the following two steps:\nI must first determine the \u201cobject, spirit or purpose of the provisions of the Income Tax Act that are relied on for the tax benefit, having regard to the scheme of the Act, the relevant provisions and permissible extrinsic aids.\u201d\nOnce this step is completed, I will \u201cexamine the factual context of [the] case in order to determine whether the avoidance transaction defeated or frustrated the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions in issue.\u201d[33]\nDetermining the object, spirit or purpose of the relevant provisions\n[35] One uses a unified textual, contextual and purposive approach to identify the object, spirit or purpose of the relevant provisions. It is the same interpretive approach as that employed by the courts in all matters of statutory interpretation. However, as the SCC noted in Copthorne, the analysis seeks a different result:\n... In a traditional statutory interpretation approach the court applies the textual, contextual and purposive analysis to determine what the words of the statute mean. In a GAAR analysis the textual, contextual and purposive analysis is employed to determine the object, spirit or purpose of a provision. Here the meaning of the words of the statute may be clear enough. The search is for the rationale that underlies the words that may not be captured by the bare meaning of the words themselves. However, determining the rationale of the relevant provisions of the Act should not be conflated with a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor with theories about what tax law ought to be or ought to do.[34]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[36] The SCC confirmed this approach in Deans Knight, emphasizing the rationale of the provision.[35] It noted the following:\n\u2026 The object, spirit and purpose analysis has a precise function: to discern the underlying rationale of the provisions. A consideration of the text, context and purpose gives structure to this analysis. Indeed, the object, spirit and purpose analysis should not turn into a \u201cvalue judgment of what is right or wrong... what tax law ought to be or ought to do\u201d (Copthorne, at para. 70). Nor should it become a \u201csearch for an overriding policy of the Act\u201d that is not founded in the text, context and purpose of the provisions (Canada Trustco, at para. 41; Alta Energy, at para. 49). Rather, a focus on the provision\u2019s text, context and purpose ensures that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence used to discern a provision\u2019s rationale remains tied to the provision itself. \u2026[36]\n[37] When determining the object, spirit and purpose of a provision, the court refers to the provision itself, the scheme of the Act and permissible extrinsic aids.[37]\n[38] As was noted in Copthorne and Deans Knight, compliance with the text of the relevant provisions is not the issue before the Court. The Minister would not have to rely on the GAAR if the tax benefit of the transaction or series of transactions was prohibited by the text of the relevant provisions.[38]\n[39] Deans Knight refers to the wording of a provision as the means to give effect to the rationale behind a provision. The words are \u201cprimarily a means of giving effect to Parliament\u2019s aim, rather than a complete encapsulation of the aim itself.\u201d[39] The SCC noted that \u201cthe means do not necessarily provide a full answer as to why the provision was adopted\u201d.[40] As my colleague, Justin Owen, noted in Husky Energy Inc. v. The King,[41] the SCC is emphasizing, \u201c[t]hat the means by which a provision achieves a particular objective will not always fully capture why Parliament enacted the provision.\u201d In short, as the SCC noted in its previous decisions on the GAAR, the text of a provision is not determinative of a provision\u2019s rationale.\n[40] The object, spirit and purpose of the provisions in question should be articulated as a concise description of the provisions\u2019 rationale:\nThe object, spirit and purpose of a provision must be worded as a description of its rationale (Copthorne, at para. 69). When articulating the object, spirit and purpose of a provision, a court is not repeating the test for the provision, nor is it crafting a new, secondary test that will apply to avoidance transactions. Discerning the object, spirit and purpose does not rewrite the provision; rather, the court merely takes a step back to formulate a concise description of the rationale underlying the provision, against which a textually compliant transaction must be scrutinized (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69).[42]\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe abuse alleged by the Minister\n[41] The Respondent argues, at paragraph 19 of his written submissions, that the Appellant abused the following five provisions of the Act:\n-Subsection 250(5.1), which applies when a corporation is continued in a jurisdiction;\n-The definition of a CCPC in subsection 125(7);\n-The definition of a Canadian corporation in subsection 89(1);\n-Section 123.3, which levies a refundable tax on certain investment income of a CCPC; and\n-The portion of the definition of full rate taxable income included in subparagraph 123.4(1)(b)(iii). The definition of full rate taxable income is used to determine the amount of the taxable income of a corporation that is eligible for the 13% rate reduction provided for in subsection 123.4(2).\n[42] I will now turn to the object, spirit and purpose of each of these provisions.\n[43] I will begin by considering the text of each of these provisions. While, as just discussed, the text is not determinative of the object, spirit or purpose of a provision, it is relevant. The text helps the Court determine what the provision was intended to do.[43] When determining the object, spirit and purpose, considering what the text of the provision expressly permits or restricts may be relevant in determining what the provision was intended to do. In addition, the text can help to \u201cidentify the nature (or \u2018type\u2019) of provision at issue, which can be relevant to understanding the rationale underlying it.\u201d[44]\n[44] After considering the text of a provision or provisions, I will consider the context and purpose of the provision or provisions at issue. At paragraph 91, Copthorne provides the following guidance on the contextual analysis:\nThe consideration of context involves an examination of other sections of the Act, as well as permissible extrinsic aids (Trustco, at para. 55). However, not every other section of the Act will be relevant in understanding the context of the provision at issue. Rather, relevant provisions are related \u201cbecause they are grouped together\u201d or because they \u201cwork together to give effect to a plausible and coherent plan\u201d (R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 361 and 364).\n[45] As noted in Deans Knight, the focus is on the relationship between the provision alleged to have been abused and the particular scheme within which it operates. The context can serve to identify the function of the provision within a coherent scheme.[45]\n[46] With respect to purpose, Deans Knight notes that understanding the provision\u2019s purpose is central to the GAAR analysis. The provision\u2019s purpose can help to discern the outcomes that Parliament sought to achieve or prevent.[46] The SCC explains the purposive analysis at paragraph 68 as follows:\n\u2026 A purposive analysis permits courts to consider legislative history and extrinsic evidence (see R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at \u00a7 9.03, at paras. 7-8). These materials provide insight into the rationale for specific provisions. Of course, tax provisions can serve a variety of independent and interlocking purposes (Trustco, at para. 53). Nevertheless, such provisions are intended to promote particular aims, and courts must therefore determine what outcome Parliament sought to achieve through the specific provision or provisions (Copthorne, at para. 113).\n[47] Similar to how one can understand the purpose of the section at issue in Deans Knight, one can only understand the purpose of the sections at issue in this appeal by considering the function that they play in the larger scheme of computing the tax payable by corporations\u2014in particular, how the Act taxes private corporations that are CCPCs and private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[48] I will first consider the two definitions at issue: the definition of a CCPC and the definition of a Canadian corporation. I will then consider each of the three other sections that are at issue in this appeal.\nObject, spirit and purpose of the definitions of CCPC and Canadian corporation\n[49] In addition to addressing the definitions of a CCPC and a Canadian corporation, I will also discuss the definition of a private corporation, since a corporation must be a private corporation before it can be a CCPC. Further, the taxation of private corporations that are not CCPCs is relevant when determining the object, spirt and purpose of the definitions of CCPC and Canadian corporation.\n[50] Subsection 248(1) states that, for the purposes of the Act, CCPC has the meaning assigned by subsection 125(7). Subsection 125(7) defines CCPC as follows:\nIn this section \u2026\n\u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation\u201d means a private corporation that is a Canadian corporation other than\n(a) a corporation controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, by one or more non-resident persons, by one or more public corporations (other than a prescribed venture capital corporation), by one or more corporations described in paragraph (c), or by any combination of them,\n(b) a corporation that would, if each share of the capital stock of a corporation that is owned by a non-resident person, by a public corporation (other than a prescribed venture capital corporation), or by a corporation described in paragraph (c) were owned by a particular person, be controlled by the particular person,\n(c) a corporation a class of the shares of the capital stock of which is listed on a designated stock exchange, or\n(d) in applying subsection (1), paragraphs 87(2)(vv) and (ww) (including, for greater certainty, in applying those paragraphs as provided under paragraph 88(1)(e.2)), the definitions \u201cexcessive eligible dividend designation\u201d, \u201cgeneral rate income pool\u201d and \u201clow rate income pool\u201d in subsection 89(1) and subsections 89(4) to (6), (8) to (10) and 249(3.1), a corporation that has made an election under subsection 89(11) and that has not revoked the election under subsection 89(12);\n[51] The definition states that CCPC means the words that follow. As a result, the definition is exhaustive.\n[52] The definition provides that in order for a corporation to be a CCPC, it must be both a private corporation and a Canadian corporation.\n[53] Private corporation is defined, for purposes of the Act, in subsection 248(1) by reference to the meaning assigned by subsection 89(1). Subsection 89(1) defines private corporation as follows:\n\u201cprivate corporation\u201d at any particular time means a corporation that, at the particular time, is resident in Canada, is not a public corporation and is not controlled by one or more public corporations (other than prescribed venture capital corporations) or prescribed federal Crown corporations or by any combination thereof and, for greater certainty, for the purposes of determining at any particular time when a corporation last became a private corporation,\n(a) a corporation that was a private corporation at the commencement of its 1972 taxation year and thereafter without interruption until the particular time shall be deemed to have last become a private corporation at the end of its 1971 taxation year, and\n(b) a corporation incorporated after 1971 that was a private corporation at the time of its incorporation and thereafter without interruption until the particular time shall be deemed to have last become a private corporation immediately before the time of its incorporation;\n[54] This definition applies at a point in time. It provides that in order for a corporation to be a private corporation at a particular point in time it must, at that particular point it time, be resident in Canada, not be a public corporation and not be controlled by one or more public corporations[47] or prescribed federal Crown corporations or by any combination of these corporations.\n[55] As will be discussed, the term private corporation is used throughout the Act when determining the taxation of corporations that are not public corporations. While the definition of a CCPC is one example of where the term is used, other examples include the provisions dealing with refundable Part IV tax[48] and the provisions dealing with capital dividends.[49]\n[56] A public corporation is defined, for the purposes of the Act, in subsection 248(1) and subsection 89(1). Generally speaking, it is a corporation that is resident in Canada and that has a class of shares listed on a designated stock exchange.\n[57] Subsection 248(1) states that, for the purposes of the Act, Canadian corporation has the meaning assigned by subsection 89(1). Subsection 89(1) defines Canadian corporation as follows:\n\u201cCanadian corporation\u201d at any time means a corporation that is resident in Canada at that time and was\n(a) incorporated in Canada, or\n(b) resident in Canada throughout the period that began on June 18, 1971 and that ends at that time,\nand for greater certainty, a corporation formed at any particular time by the amalgamation or merger of, or by a plan of arrangement or other corporate reorganization in respect of, 2 or more corporations (otherwise than as a result of the acquisition of property of one corporation by another corporation, pursuant to the purchase of the property by the other corporation or as a result of the distribution of the property to the other corporation on the winding-up of the corporation) is a Canadian corporation because of paragraph (a) only if\n(c) that reorganization took place under the laws of Canada or a province, and\n(d) each of those corporations was, immediately before the particular time, a Canadian corporation;\n[58] Under this definition, a corporation will be a Canadian corporation at any time if, at the particular time, it is a resident of Canada and was incorporated in Canada.[50]\n[59] Because of the definitions of private corporation and Canadian corporation, in order for a corporation to be a CCPC at a particular point in time, the corporation must be resident in Canada and incorporated in Canada. Also, it must not be a public corporation or controlled by one or more public corporations, or prescribed federal Crown corporations or by any combination of these corporations.\n[60] Even if the corporation is a private corporation and a Canadian corporation, it will not be a CCPC if it is included in paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of CCPC. Paragraphs (a) to (c) exclude corporations controlled directly or indirectly in any manner by one or more non-resident persons, corporations controlled by one or more public corporations, corporations with a class of shares listed on a designated stock exchange, or any combinations of them. Paragraph (d) of the definition provides that a corporation that has made an election under subsection 89(11) is deemed to not be a CCPC for the purpose of the small business deduction rate and the eligible dividend scheme.\n[61] The definitions of CCPC, private corporation and Canadian corporation were first added to the Act in 1971 as part of the 1971 tax reform legislation.\n[62] At the time of their introduction, the government emphasized the importance of recognizing whether a corporation was described in the Act as a private corporation or a CCPC. The Department of National Revenue\u2019s 1971 guide on corporate taxation noted the following:\n\u2026 The importance of the income tax implications where a corporation is a private corporation, or a particular type of private corporation such as a Canadian\u2011controlled private corporation, cannot be over-emphasized. The reader is therefore asked to pay particular attention to the exact term used when a corporation is described in the Act \u2026[51]\n[63] As will be discussed, the importance of the definitions of private corporation and CCPC in determining the taxation of a corporation under the Act continues under the current scheme of the Act.\n[64] The definition of CCPC at the time that it was added to the Act in 1971 read as follows:\n(a) \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation\u201d means a private corporation that is a Canadian corporation other than a corporation controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, by one or more non-resident persons, by one or more public corporations or by any combination thereof;[52]\n[65] Parliament has amended the definition on numerous occasions, as follows:\n-It was amended in 1980 to provide that a corporation did not lose its status as a CCPC if it was controlled by a public corporation that was a prescribed venture capital corporation;[53]\n-It was amended in 1998 to add text similar to current paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition;[54]\n-Minor amendments were made to the definition of CCPC in 2001.[55] This included adjustments to the wording of the provision and the addition of the reference to paragraph (c) in paragraph (a) that is found in the current version; and\n-The definition was amended twice in 2007. The first of these amendments added paragraph (d) for the purposes of the subsection 89(11) election discussed above.[56] The second of these amendments substituted the term \u201cdesignated stock exchange\u201d for \u201cprescribed stock exchange.\u201d[57]\n[66] The definition of Canadian corporation at the time that it was added to the Act in 1971 read as follows:\n(a) \u201cCanadian corporation\u201d at any time means a corporation that was resident in Canada at that time and was\n(i) incorporated in Canada, or\n(ii) resident in Canada throughout the period commencing June 18, 1971 and ending at that time,\nexcept that for the purposes of subsection 83(1) a corporation that was incorporated in Canada before April 27, 1965 and that was not resident in Canada at the end of 1971 shall be deemed not to be a Canadian corporation;\n[67] The definition was amended in 1977 to remove the text after subparagraph 89(1)(a)(ii) above.[58] The definition was then amended in 1994 to the current version by including the text referring to amalgamations after paragraph (b).[59]\n[68] The text of the definition of Canadian corporation creates a class of corporations that meets the conditions of the definition. The definition is intended to differentiate between corporations that are resident in Canada and corporations that are not resident in Canada, as well as between corporations incorporated in Canada and outside of Canada.\n[69] Pursuant to the definition of a CCPC, a private corporation cannot be a CCPC unless it is a Canadian corporation. As a result, to be a CCPC at a particular point in time, a private corporation must either be incorporated in Canada or have been resident in Canada continuously since June 18, 1971.\n[70] The text of the definition of CCPC is intended to narrow down the pool of private corporations that qualify as CCPCs to include only those that are Canadian corporations and that are not described in paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of a CCPC.\n[71] As will be discussed, the effect of a corporation being defined as a public corporation, a private corporation or a private corporation that is a CCPC is key to determining the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions at issue in these appeals. This will be evident once the function that each of the definitions plays in the scheme of the Act is considered.\n[72] Numerous provisions of the Act distinguish between a public corporation, a CCPC and a private corporation. As well, certain provisions only apply if a corporation is a Canadian corporation. This results in different taxing regimes for public corporations, CCPCs, and private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[73] All corporations that are resident in Canada are taxed on their worldwide income. However, for policy reasons the Act draws important distinctions between public corporations and private corporations and between private corporations that are CCPCs and private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[74] Generally speaking, private corporations are entitled to a number of advantages that are not available to public companies. Further, CCPCs are entitled to a number of tax benefits that are not extended to private companies that are not CCPCs.\n[75] This can be seen by contrasting the taxing regime for CCPCs and the taxing regime for private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[76] Most private corporations that are not CCPCs are only subject to the general Part I tax rate of 28% on their taxable income (the \u201cGeneral Tax Rate\u201d). This rate is composed of the 38% tax levied under subsection 123(1) on the taxable income of a corporation, reduced by the federal abatement of 10% of the corporation\u2019s taxable income earned in the year in a province.[60] As I will discuss, in most instances the 28% General Tax Rate is reduced by a further 13% under section 123.4, resulting in a corporate tax rate of 15%.\n[77] The calculation of the tax rate for CCPCs is not as straightforward. The applicable tax rate varies depending on the nature and amount of the income. A CCPC must identify its active business income and its aggregate investment income.\n[78] A CCPC, at the outset, is liable to pay tax at the 28% General Tax Rate on all of its income. However, the 28% General Tax Rate is reduced for active business income of the CCPC that is eligible for the $500,000 small business deduction. In the relevant years, the portion of the CCPC\u2019s income that was eligible for the small business deduction was subject to an effective tax rate of 11% in 2015 and 10.5% in 2016 (the \u201cEligible Small Business Tax Rate\u201d).\n[79] The CCPC\u2019s business income that is not eligible for the small business deduction is, in most instances, subject to the same 15% tax rate applicable to most private corporations (the General Tax Rate minus the 13% section 123.4 reduction).\n[80] The CCPC\u2019s income that is aggregate investment income[61] is, at the time that the income is earned, subject to the 28% General Tax Rate plus an additional refundable tax under section 123.3. This resulted in a CCPC paying, in the year that the aggregate investment income was realized, tax at an effective rate of 34.66% in 2015 and 38.66% in 2016. However, on payment of a dividend, a significant portion of this tax was refunded, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8%.[62] The taxation of a CCPC\u2019s investment income will be discussed in more detail, when I discuss section 123.3.\n[81] In summary, a CCPC may be taxed on some of its business income at the same rate as the rate paid by a private corporation that is not a CCPC; it may be taxed on another portion of its business income at a lower rate; and it may be taxed initially on its investment income at a rate this is 10.66% higher than the General Tax Rate, but then taxed at a significantly lower rate on the payment of a dividend.\n[82] This specific tax regime for CCPCs is contained in a number of provisions. For example, numerous sections of the Act only apply to corporations that are CCPCs, other sections only apply to corporations that are not CCPCs, and certain sections may apply differently to corporations depending on whether the corporation is a CCPC. These provisions relate to both the taxation of the corporation and the taxation of the shareholders of the corporation.\n[83] This can be seen from the following examples:\n-Subsection 127(10.1) of the Act provides an additional refundable investment tax credit for scientific research and experimental development expenditures incurred by a CCPC;[63]\n-The payment deadline for a corporation\u2019s payment of its taxes is extended by one month for certain CCPCs;[64]\n-The normal reassessment period for a corporation that is a CCPC is three years, while the normal reassessment period for a corporation that is not a CCPC is four years;[65]\n-Under the Act, an individual resident in Canada who is a shareholder of a CCPC that is a small business corporation is generally entitled to a capital gains exemption on the sale of his or her CCPC shares, provided that he or she meets certain requirements, up to a limited exemption amount across his or her entire lifetime.[66] Shareholders of private corporations that do not have CCPC status are not entitled to this capital gains exemption;\n-Subsection 7(1.1) defers the payment of tax on stock option benefits realized by an employee of a CCPC. An employee of a CCPC who receives stock options in his or her CCPC employer is not taxed at the time of exercising the option, but is rather taxed at the time that the employee disposes of the shares, on the condition that the employee is dealing at arm\u2019s length with his or her employer.[67] Employees of non-CCPCs are not entitled to the aforementioned deferred stock option benefit and are generally taxed when the option is exercised;\n-Shareholders of eligible small business corporations who sell their shares in exchange for other shares of eligible small business corporations are generally entitled to a rollover of their capital gains on the disposition of their shares. One of the requirements for a corporation to qualify as an eligible small business corporation is that it must be a CCPC;[68] and\n-Taxpayers may reduce their taxable income from any source by the amount of their allowable business investment loss.[69] An allowable business investment loss is a loss resulting from the disposition of capital property that meets certain requirements. One of these requirements is that the property is either a share or a debt in a CCPC that is a small business corporation.[70]\n[84] There are also certain provisions that benefit CCPCs but that do not benefit corporations, including a private corporation such as the Appellant, that are corporations resident in Canada but that are not Canadian corporations. The Appellant lost its status as a Canadian corporation, and thus its status as a CCPC, once it was continued in the British Virgin Islands. Since the Appellant ceased to be a Canadian corporation, it also ceased to be a taxable Canadian corporation. As a result, it lost the benefit of certain provisions, such as the following:\n-Section 85, which allows property to be transferred to a taxable Canadian corporation on a tax-deferred basis. While the rollover provision is available to a CCPC, it is not available to a private corporation, such as the Appellant, that is not a taxable Canadian corporation;\n-Section 87, which allows corporations to amalgamate on a tax-deferred basis, also only applies to taxable Canadian corporations;\n-For the same reason, section 88, which allows corporations such as CCPCs to be wound up on a tax-deferred basis, is not available to private corporations such as the Appellant; and\n-The dividend gross-up and tax credit mechanism provided for in subsection 82(1) and section 121 is discussed in the next few paragraphs. These provisions do not apply to dividends received from corporations that are resident in Canada but that are not taxable Canadian corporations.[71]\n[85] As mentioned previously, the tax regime for CCPCs extends to the tax paid on distributions to its shareholders.\n[86] The Act has a specific set of rules that integrate the tax paid by corporations and shareholders when dividends are paid to a corporation\u2019s shareholders. These rules apply differently to CCPCs and to non-CCPCs\u2014particularly non-CCPCs that are not Canadian corporations, such as the Appellant.\n[87] Since a corporation is not entitled to deduct dividends paid to shareholders from its taxable income, profits paid out to shareholders as dividends are taxed twice: first, at the corporate level as income of the company, and second, at the shareholder level as personal income of the individual shareholder.\n[88] The Carter Commission recommended the elimination of this double tax by integrating corporate and personal income taxes through a dividend gross-up and credit system. The tax reform of 1971 implemented a system of integration for Canadian investment income of private corporations and (within limits) the Canadian active business income of CCPCs.\n[89] The dividend gross-up and credit system has evolved over the years both for policy reasons and to take into account the ever-changing corporate tax rates. Under the current system, Canadian corporations pay two types of taxable dividends, eligible dividends and non-eligible dividends. Generally speaking, an eligible dividend is a dividend paid by a corporation from its after-tax income that was subject to the General Tax Rate. A non-eligible dividend is a dividend paid by a corporation from its after-tax income that was subject to a lower rate of tax, such as income of a CCPC that was taxed at the Eligible Small Business Tax Rate, or was part of its aggregate investment income.[72] Eligible dividends have a higher gross-up and credit imputed to shareholders than non-eligible dividends.\n[90] The Act imposes restrictions on paying eligible dividends based on the status of the corporate payer. The restrictions are penalties imposed under Part III.1 of the Act when a corporation pays excessive eligible dividends.[73] The Act contains different tests for the imposition of Part III.1 tax depending on whether the corporation is a CCPC or a Canadian resident corporation that is not a CCPC. Generally speaking, the rules are as follows:\n-A CCPC may pay an eligible dividend in a taxation year only to the extent of its general rate income pool (\u201cGRIP\u201d) at the end of its taxation year without being subject to Part III.1 tax; and\n-A Canadian resident corporation that is not a CCPC may pay eligible dividends in any amount. However, any such corporation cannot pay an eligible dividend free of Part III.3 tax until it has paid non-eligible dividends and reduced its low rate income pool (\u201cLRIP\u201d) to nil.\n[91] GRIP is defined in subsection 89(1). The definition only applies to a taxable Canadian corporation that is a CCPC in a particular taxation year or to a deposit insurance corporation in a particular taxation year. A CCPC\u2019s GRIP balance, which is computed at the end of a particular year, can be a positive or negative amount. While the formula is long and complex, it generally reflects income of the CCPC that is not part of its aggregate investment income and income that has not benefited from the small business deduction or any other special tax rate.\n[92] LRIP is defined in subsection 89(1). The definition does not apply to CCPCs. The definition does apply to all other corporations resident in Canada. A non\u2011CCPC\u2019s LRIP generally reflects income that has benefited from certain preferential tax rates.\n[93] In summary, the rules in the Act that effect integration through eligible and ineligible dividends recognize the different tax regimes for CCPCs and non\u2011CCPCs.\n[94] As mentioned previously, shareholders of a corporation that, like the Appellant, is not a CCPC and is not a Canadian corporation cannot benefit from the dividend gross-up and credit system. A corporation must be a Canadian corporation in order to use the dividend gross-up and credit system.\nObject, spirit and purpose of the definitions\n[95] The Respondent\u2019s position with respect to the object, spirit and purpose of the definition of a CCPC is set out at paragraph 124 of his written submissions. This paragraph reads as follows:\nThe [object, spirit and purpose] of the CCPC definition is to ensure that private corporations directly or indirectly controlled in any manner whatever by Canadian residents are subject to the anti-deferral regime applicable to the investment income of CCPCs. This is how the respondent described the [object, spirit and purpose] in his pleadings. This description is more precisely a description of part of the [object, spirit and purpose] of the CCPC definition. The definition mainly serves as a criterion for obtaining benefits, especially the small business deduction on the first $500,000 in active business income.\n[96] The Appellant argues that the object, spirit and purpose of the definition of CCPC is to enumerate the specific criteria chosen by Parliament to be afforded such status.[74]\n[97] I agree with the Appellant.\n[98] From the time of the definitions\u2019 introduction until the present, the rationale of each definition has not changed. The Act contains a detailed and specific regime for taxing CCPCs, including specific provisions for taxing their business income, for taxing their investment income and for taxing distributions to their shareholders. Other provisions provide specific benefits to corporations that are defined to be CCPCs. The object, spirit and purpose of the definition of a CCPC is to provide a dividing line between those corporations that are taxed under the specific regime for CCPCs and those corporations that are not taxed under this regime.\n[99] Similarly, the object, spirit and purpose of the definition of a Canadian corporation is to set out the specific criteria that must be satisfied before a corporation is considered for the purposes of the Act to be a Canadian corporation.\nSection 123.3\n[100] Section 123.3 reads as follows:\n123.3 There shall be added to the tax otherwise payable under this Part for each taxation year by a corporation that is throughout the year a Canadian-controlled private corporation an amount equal to 10 2\/3% of the lesser of\n(a) the corporation\u2019s aggregate investment income for the year (within the meaning assigned by subsection 129(4)), and\n(b) the amount, if any, by which its taxable income for the year exceeds the least of the amounts determined in respect of it for the year under paragraphs 125(1)(a) to (c).\n[101] The provision levies a 10 2\/3% tax on the lesser of a CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income (within the meaning assigned by subsection 129(4)) and the amount determined under paragraph 123.3(b). The amount determined under paragraph 123.3(b) is the amount by which the CCPC\u2019s taxable income exceeds its small business deduction limit determined under paragraphs 125(1)(a) to (c). Since in most instances the CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income will be less than or equal to the amount calculated under paragraph 123.3(b), the section 123.3 tax is normally 10 2\/3% of a CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income.\n[102] Subsection 129(4) defines the aggregate investment income of a corporation as follows:\naggregate investment income of a corporation for a taxation year means the amount, if any, by which the total of all amounts, each of which is\n(a) the amount, if any, by which\n(i) the eligible portion of the corporation\u2019s taxable capital gains for the year\nexceeds the total of\n(ii) the eligible portion of its allowable capital losses for the year, and\n(iii) the amount, if any, deducted under paragraph 111(1)(b) in computing its taxable income for the year, or\n(b) the corporation\u2019s income for the year from a source that is a property, other than\n(i) exempt income,\n(ii) an amount included under subsection 12(10.2) in computing the corporation\u2019s income for the year,\n(iii) the portion of any dividend that was deductible in computing the corporation\u2019s taxable income for the year, and\n(iv) income that, but for paragraph 108(5)(a), would not be income from a property,\nexceeds the total of all amounts, each of which is the corporation\u2019s loss for the year from a source that is a property.\n[103] The eligible portion of a CCPC\u2019s taxable capital gains or allowable capital losses is the portion that \u201ccannot reasonably be regarded as having accrued while the property, or a property for which it was substituted, was property of a corporation other than a Canadian-controlled private corporation\u201d.[75] As a result, paragraph 129(4)(a) only includes taxable capital gains or allowable capital losses of a CCPC to the extent that they accrued while the corporation was a CCPC.\n[104] Subsection 129(4) provides that a corporation\u2019s income or loss for the year from a source that is property includes the income or loss from a specified investment business carried on in Canada other than income or loss from a source outside of Canada.[76] Generally speaking, a specified investment business is a business whose principal purpose is to earn income from property.[77]\n[105] Subsection 129(4) excludes from a corporation\u2019s income or loss from a source that is property, income or loss from any property that is \u201cincident to or pertains to an active business carried on by it, or that is used or held principally for the purpose of gaining or producing income from an active business carried on by it.\u201d[78]\n[106] Subparagraphs b(i) to b(iv) of the definition of aggregate investment income exclude the following from a corporation\u2019s income from a source that is property:\n-exempt income;\n-income paid out of an \u201cNISA Fund No. 2\u201d, which relates to certain agricultural income stabilization programs;\n-inter-corporate dividends that are deductible under subsection 112(1) or subsection 113(1); and\n-income that is deemed under paragraph 108(5)(a) to be property income when distributed by a trust.\n[107] The text of section 123.3 and the definition of aggregate investment income indicate that section 123.3 is intended to levy a 10 2\/3% tax on a CCPC\u2019s passive income, composed of the excess of its eligible taxable capital gains over its allowable capital losses, plus its net income from property that the CCPC does not use in its active business or that is not incidental to the active business.\n[108] As will be discussed, this tax is refundable.\n[109] Section 123.3 was added to the Act in 1996.[79] Originally, section 123.3 imposed a refundable tax of 6 2\/3% on aggregate investment income. This amount was increased in 2016 to the current rate of 10 2\/3% to coincide with an equivalent increase to the highest marginal rate on personal income tax in the same year.[80]\n[110] Section 123.3 is part of a legislative scheme in the Act for the taxing of investment income of a CCPC. The search for the rationale underlying the text of the provision requires consideration of this legislative scheme.\n[111] \u201cThe rules concerning the investment income of CCPCs attempt to make the corporation an investment vehicle of little tax significance.\u201d[81] The Act contains two sets of rules that attempt to accomplish this objective.\n[112] The first set of rules, the previously discussed dividend gross-up and credit scheme, attempts to integrate the tax paid by CCPCs and their shareholders through the use of eligible and non-eligible dividends.\n[113] The second set of rules attempts to discourage the retention of investment income in the CCPC, while maintaining the integration of the CCPC\u2019s and its shareholders\u2019 tax structures. This set of rules comprises section 123.3 and the sections that provide for a refundable portion of a CCPC\u2019s Part I tax.\n[114] Section 123.3 attempts to discourage the retention of a CCPC\u2019s investment income by initially taxing the investment income at a 38 2\/3% tax rate. This is made up of the 28% General Tax Rate plus the 10 2\/3% tax levied under section 123.3. The 38 2\/3% tax rate is intended to be roughly equal to the highest personal tax rate paid by an individual shareholder and thus reduces or eliminates any advantage that would arise on retaining the investment income in the corporation and deferring the payment of the tax that emerges on the distribution of the investment income to the shareholders of the CCPC.\n[115] This was explained by the government at the time that section 123.3 was introduced, as follows:\nEffective July 1, 1995, a refundable tax will be levied on the investment income received by a Canadian-controlled private corporation. This tax will reduce the current deferral advantage to individuals earning investment income through these private corporations instead of earning such income directly. The deferral advantage arises when the corporate tax rate applied to this income is lower than the marginal tax rate of the individual shareholder.[82]\n[116] As noted in the budget document, the section 123.3 tax is refundable.\n[117] Similar comments were made in the Department of Finance explanatory notes that were issued at the time that the refundable tax levied under section 123.3 was increased from 6 2\/3% to 10 2\/3%. The comments were as follows:\nSection 123.3 of the Act imposes an additional amount of tax under Part I of the Act on investment income of a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC). A corporation that is a CCPC throughout a taxation year must add to its tax otherwise payable under Part I for that year an amount that is equal to 6 2\/3% of the lesser of two amounts. \u2026 The objective of this additional tax is to reduce personal income tax deferral possibilities that individuals earning investment income directly might otherwise obtain by earning such income through a CCPC.\nThis section is amended to increase the rate from 6 2\/3% to 10 2\/3%, consequential to the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate of 33% in subsection 117(2).[83]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[118] The tax is refunded to the CCPC when dividends are paid out to shareholders. This is done through the use of a CCPC\u2019s refundable dividend tax on hand (\u201cRDTOH\u201d) account. The RDTOH account was created as part of the 1971 tax reform.[84]\n[119] All private corporations establish a RDTOH in which they credit the Part IV tax paid on deductible inter-corporate dividends. During 2016, CCPCs, in addition to crediting their RDTOH account with any Part IV tax that they paid during the year, credited their RDTOH with 30 2\/3%[85] of their aggregate investment income.[86] The 30 2\/3% represented the 10 2\/3% tax that a CCPC paid under section 123 on its aggregate investment income and tax of 20% of its aggregate investment income, which represents part of the tax paid at the 28% General Tax Rate.[87]\n[120] On declaration of taxable dividends, private corporations, including CCPCs, were entitled to a dividend refund of 1\/3 of the value of the dividend up to the amount of their RDTOH account.[88]\n[121] While, during the relevant years, both CCPCs and corporations that were not CCPCs maintained RDTOH accounts, only CCPCs were entitled to a refund in respect of the Part I tax that they paid on their aggregate investment income. Private corporations that were not CCPCs were only entitled to claim a dividend refund in respect of Part IV tax.\n[122] The purpose of paying a dividend refund to CCPCs in respect of the Part I tax that they paid on their aggregate investment income was to lower the tax rate to a level that allowed for the integration of corporate and shareholder taxes under the first set of rules.[89] During the relevant period, a CCPC paid Part I tax at a rate of 8% on its aggregate investment income after receiving the dividend refund.[90]\n[123] The effect of section 123.3 and the refundable dividend tax mechanism is to first tax the CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income at a high rate to try to minimize any tax deferral that may be realized by the CCPC deferring the distribution of the aggregate investment income to its shareholders, but then to tax the aggregate investment income at a low rate once it is distributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders. This low tax rate allows the dividend gross-up and credit system to operate properly. The Minister of Finance explained this scheme at the time of the introduction of section 123.3 as follows:\nThe RDTOH account of a private corporation accumulates two amounts:\nall of the Part IV tax paid by that corporation on its portfolio dividend income; and\nfor CCPCs, up to 20 percentage points of the Part I tax paid on its investment income (other than deductible dividends) and taxable capital gains.\nThe corporation is then free to distribute taxable dividends out of both its retained earnings and this RDTOH account to the shareholder. \u2026\nIn recent years the spread between corporate and personal income tax rates has generally increased. In several provinces, the top personal tax rate exceeds the top corporate rate by a significant amount. This creates an incentive for individuals to defer tax by accumulating investment income in a private corporation rather than earning the income directly.\nBy imposing an additional refundable tax of 6 2\u20443 per cent on investment income earned by a CCPC, this proposal will reduce or eliminate the deferral advantage of earning investment income in the corporation as opposed to earning it directly. Because this additional tax will also be credited to the RDTOH account, the integration of the corporate and individual tax structures will be maintained. Corporations will now receive a refund of their RDTOH at a rate of one dollar for every three dollars of taxable dividends paid.[91]\nObject, spirit and purpose of section 123.3\n[124] The Respondent argues that the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.3 is to prevent Canadian resident individuals who control a private corporation from deferring tax on the investment income of the corporation. The Respondent states the following at paragraph 25 of his written submissions:\nEven though the text of s.123.3 applies to only CCPCs, the [object, spirit and purpose] of s. 123.3 is broader. The [object, spirit and purpose] is to prevent a Canadian resident individual from deferring tax on investment income, including taxable capital gains, earned through private corporations that they control directly or indirectly in any matter whatever. This OSP is found in the legislative history of the integration\/anti-deferral regime for the investment income of a private corporation, of which s. 123.3 became part.\n[125] The Appellant disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s position. It argues that the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.3 is to prevent a Canadian individual who controls a CCPC from deferring tax on investment income of a corporation. In its view, the government never intended for the provision to apply to a private corporation that is not a CCPC.\n[126] The text of section 123.3 indicates that the intention of section 123.3 was to levy the refundable tax on CCPCs. The use of the words Canadian controlled private corporation in section 123.3 reflects part of the means used by the government to translate its aims into legislative form. However, as the SCC noted in Deans Knight, the means do not necessarily provide a full answer as to why Parliament adopted the provision.[92] I must reach my conclusion on the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.3 based on the text plus the contextual and purposive analysis just undertaken.\n[127] As discussed, section 123.3 is part of the scheme for taxing investment income of a CCPC. This scheme involves two sets of rules: (1) the rules relating to integration effected by the dividend gross-up and credit scheme; and (2) the rules attempting to discourage the retention of investment income, while maintaining integration, which are set out in section 123.3 and in the dividend refund scheme.\n[128] The first set of rules, the dividend gross-up and credit scheme contains a specific scheme for CCPCs. As discussed previously, the dividend gross-up and credit scheme distinguishes between eligible dividends and non-eligible dividends. A CCPC, unlike a corporation that is not a CCPC, must calculate a GRIP account balance. The CCPC\u2019s ability to pay an eligible dividend is dependent on the balance in this GRIP account. The exclusion of a CCPC\u2019s investment from its GRIP account recognizes that the investment income of the CCPC is taxed at a lower rate once it is distributed to the CCPC\u2019s shareholder. In short, the dividend gross-up rules contain a specific scheme for CCPCs.\n[129] It is the same for the second set of rules, which are contained in section 123.3 and the refundable dividend tax provisions. Section 123.3 only applies to CCPCs. More importantly, even though all private corporations establish an RDTOH account, only a CCPC is allowed to credit their RDTOH account with a portion of the Part I tax that it paid on its investment income.\n[130] The amount credited by the CCPC to its RDTOH account includes both the tax that it paid under section 123.3 plus a portion of the tax paid at the General Tax Rate. The amount credited in respect of the General Tax Rate represents tax that is paid by both CCPCs and private corporations that are not CCPCs; however, Parliament has chosen to not include private corporations that are not CCPCs in the RDTOH scheme for Part I tax.\n[131] The two sets of rules evidence that section 123.3 is part of a legislative scheme that the government only intended to apply to CCPCs.\n[132] This conclusion is consistent with the various pronouncements made by the government when it introduced section 123.3 in 1995 and when it amended the provision in 2016 to increase the rate. It is clear from these pronouncements that the government was aware that the tax deferral opportunity existed for all individuals who held shares in private companies, but that it only chose to impose the section 123.3 refundable tax on CCPCs.\n[133] The Appellant argues that the history of the rules for the RDTOH make it clear that Parliament intended for the refundable tax regime (which section 123.3 joined in 1996)\u2014as it applies to Part I tax on investment income\u2014to only apply to those private companies that are CCPCs.\n[134] At the time that section 129 was introduced in 1971 as part of the 1971 tax reform, the definition of RDTOH in subsection 129(3) allowed all private corporations (not just CCPCs) to add 25% of their Canadian investment income to their RDTOH accounts.[93]\n[135] In 1981, the Act was amended to restrict the addition to the RDTOH account in respect of Part I tax paid on investment income to corporations that were CCPCs.[94] The words \u201cprivate corporation\u201d in paragraph 129(3)(a) were replaced with the words \u201cCanadian-controlled private corporation throughout the year\u201d.\n[136] As a result, private corporations that were not CCPCs could no longer benefit from the RDTOH rules with respect to the Part I tax that they paid on investment income. This change was explained in the 1982 Department of Finance technical notes as follows:\nParagraph 129(3)(a) of the Act defines the \u201crefundable dividend tax on hand\u201d of a private corporation. This represents the portion of tax on investment income which is refunded to a private corporation on payment by it of dividends.\nThere are two changes to the calculation of refundable dividend tax on hand. First, the corporation must be a Canadian-controlled private corporation throughout the year in order for its investment income to earn refundable dividend tax in taxation years commencing after November 12, 1981. \u2026 [95]\n[137] I agree with the Appellant that this history of the definition of RDTOH shows that Parliament intended for the refundable tax regime for Part I tax, which now includes section 123.3, to only apply to CCPCs.\n[138] The SCC has consistently stated that the object, spirit and purpose analysis should not become a \u201csearch for an overriding policy of the Act\u201d that is not found in the text, context and purpose of those provisions.[96] However, this is exactly what the Respondent is asking me to do. In my view, the text, context and purpose of section 123.3 does not support a finding that its object, spirt and purpose was to prevent Canadian resident individuals from deferring tax on investment income held in any private corporations.\n[139] A consideration of the text, context and purpose of section 123.3 leads to the conclusion that the object, spirit and purpose of the section, its rationale, is to, together with the refundable tax regime and the dividend gross-up and tax credit scheme, prevent the use of a CCPC to defer taxes that may be payable at a higher rate by the shareholders of the CCPC, while maintaining the integration of taxes paid by CCPCs and their shareholders.\nSection 123.4\n[140] Subsection 123.4(2) provides what is referred to as the \u201cGeneral Rate Reduction\u201d. The subsection reduces the General Tax Rate of a corporation by the general rate reduction percentage. The subsection reads as follows:\nGeneral deduction from tax \u2014 There may be deducted from a corporation\u2019s tax otherwise payable under this Part for a taxation year the product obtained by multiplying the corporation\u2019s general rate reduction percentage for the year by the corporation\u2019s full rate taxable income for the year.\n[141] The general rate reduction percentage is defined in subsection 123.4(1). For years after 2011, the percentage is 13%. As a result, the tax rate that a corporation pays on its full rate taxable income is reduced from the General Tax Rate of 28% to 15%.\n[142] The full rate taxable income of a corporation is defined in subsection 123.4(1). The definition distinguishes between the income of a corporation that is throughout the year a CCPC; the income of a corporation that is throughout the year an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation or a mutual fund; and the income of all other corporations. It reads as follows:\n123.4 (1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section. \u2026\nfull rate taxable income of a corporation for a taxation year is\n(a) if the corporation is not a corporation described in paragraph (b) or (c) for the year, the amount by which that portion of the corporation\u2019s taxable income for the year (or, for greater certainty, if the corporation is non-resident, that portion of its taxable income earned in Canada for the year) that is subject to tax under subsection 123(1) exceeds the total of\n(i) if an amount is deducted under subsection 125.1(1) from the corporation\u2019s tax otherwise payable under this Part for the year, the amount obtained by dividing the amount so deducted by the corporation\u2019s general rate reduction percentage for the taxation year,\n(ii) if an amount is deducted under subsection 125.1(2) from the corporation\u2019s tax otherwise payable under this Part for the year, the amount determined, in respect of the deduction, by the formula in that subsection,\n(iii) the corporation\u2019s income for the year from a personal services business, and\n(iv) if the corporation is a credit union throughout the year and the corporation deducted an amount for the year under subsection 125(1) (because of the application of subsections 137(3) and (4)), the amount, if any, that is the product of the amount, if any, determined for B in subsection 137(3) multiplied by the amount determined for C in subsection 137(3) in respect of the corporation for the year;\n(b) if the corporation is a Canadian-controlled private corporation throughout the year, the amount by which that portion of the corporation\u2019s taxable income for the year that is subject to tax under subsection 123(1) exceeds the total of\n(i) the amounts that would, if paragraph (a) applied to the corporation, be determined under subparagraphs (a)(i) to (iv) in respect of the corporation for the year,\n(ii) the least of the amounts, if any, determined under paragraphs 125(1)(a) to (c) in respect of the corporation for the year, and\n(iii) except for a corporation that is, throughout the year, a cooperative corporation (within the meaning assigned by subsection 136(2)) or a credit union, the corporation\u2019s aggregate investment income for the year, within the meaning assigned by subsection 129(4); and\n(c) if the corporation is throughout the year an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation or a mutual fund corporation, nil.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[143] Under paragraph (c) of the definition, the full rate taxable income of an investment corporation, a mortgage investment corporation or a mutual fund is nil. This means that such corporations are not entitled to claim the General Rate Reduction.\n[144] Paragraph (a) of the definition applies to all corporations other than CCPCs, and corporations described in paragraph (c) of the definition. Under this paragraph, the full rate taxable income of the corporation is the corporation\u2019s taxable income that is subject to tax under subsection 123(1)[97] minus the amounts set out in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (a) of the definition. Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) refer to following:\n-amounts deducted by the corporation in respect of manufacturing and processing profits, and electrical energy and steam sales. These amounts are otherwise subject to rate reductions;\n-the corporation\u2019s income from a personal service business; and\n-certain amounts in respect of a credit union.\n[145] Paragraph (b) of the definition applies only to CCPCs. A CCPC\u2019s full rate taxable income is the CCPC\u2019s taxable income that is subject to tax under subsection 123(1) minus the amounts set out in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of paragraph (b) of the definition. Subparagraphs (i) to (iii) refer to the following:\n-the amounts just discussed that are set out in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of paragraph (a) of the definition;\n-the amount of the CCPC\u2019s active business income for the year that is eligible for the small business deduction as determined under paragraphs 125(1)(a) to (c); and\n-the CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income for the year as defined in subsection 129(4).\n[146] The text indicates that Parliament intended that the General Rate Reduction be available to all corporations other than the corporations set out in paragraph (c) of the definition. Further, the text indicates that the intention was not to apply the General Rate Reduction to income that was taxed at a rate that was lower than the General Tax Rate of 28% (the 38% general corporate tax rate minus the 10% abatement), such as the income of a CCPC that is either investment income or income that is eligible for the small business deduction or the income of a corporation that is eligible for the manufacturing and processing profit credit.\n[147] This can be seen from the exclusions under paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition. Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of the definition (which also apply to CCPCs) exclude income that is eligible for the lower corporate tax rate available in respect of a corporation\u2019s manufacturing and processing profits and its income from electrical energy and steam sales.\n[148] With respect to CCPCs, paragraph (b) of the definition extends the exclusion to the CCPC\u2019s profits from its active business that are taxed at a lower rate as a result of the small business deduction and the CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income. As discussed, the CCPC\u2019s aggregate investment income is originally taxed at a high rate; however, after the application of the RDTOH rules, the aggregate investment income is taxed a lower rate than the General Tax Rate.\n[149] The portion of a CCPC\u2019s business income that is not taxed at the lower small business rate is eligible for the General Rate Reduction.\n[150] Section 123.4 was enacted in 2001.[98] The section originally provided a general rate reduction percentage of 1% for non-CCPCs and a reduction of 7% for a CCPC\u2019s business income between $200,000 (the small business limit at the time) and $300,000.[99] In the 2000 Budget, the government stated that it intended, within five years, to reduce the federal corporate tax rate by 7% on all business income not currently eligible for special tax treatment.\n[151] The 2000 Budget Plan explained the government\u2019s purpose behind enacting the section, namely that it was being used as a mechanism to keep Canada\u2019s corporate tax rates competitive, and specifically, that it was targeting areas that were otherwise not subject to favourable tax treatment: [100]\nMaking the Economy More\nInternationally Competitive\nReduction in the Tax Rate\nfor Highest Taxed Sectors\nTo prosper in the global economy, Canada needs a business tax system that is internationally competitive. This is important because business tax rates have a significant impact on the level of business investment, employment, productivity, wages and incomes.\nCanadian effective tax rates for small businesses, the manufacturing and processing (M&P) sector and the resource sector are by and large internationally competitive. As a result of special tax preferences, small businesses effectively have a federal tax rate of about 12 per cent while the M&P and resource sectors have a federal tax rate of about 21 per cent. However, other sectors of the economy are subject to the high general corporate tax rate without any special provisions. These highest taxed sectors include fast-growing service and high\u2011technology firms that will influence the pace of Canada\u2019s future economic and social development. In recent years, many industrialized countries have either reduced their corporate tax rates or announced their intention to lower them. If no action were taken, Canada\u2019s general corporate tax rate would not be competitive with those of our trading partners.\nThe Government\u2019s objective is to reduce, within five years, the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 per cent from 28 per cent on business income not currently eligible for special tax treatment. As a first step, the budget proposes to reduce this rate to 27 per cent effective January 1, 2001 (Table 4.2). Once fully implemented by 2004, the combined federal-provincial tax rate, including both income and capital taxes, would be reduced from the current average of 47 per cent to 40 per cent, a more competitive level vis-\u00e0-vis other G-7 countries (Chart 4.3).\n[152] This drive to spur investment was again reiterated by the Minister of Finance in his October 2000 economic statement speech, where the government increased the speed at which it intended to reduce the federal corporate tax rate.[101] The Minister of Finance noted the following:\nIn Budget 2000, we set out a five-year plan to lower that rate from 28% to 21%. The plan called for a one-point drop next year with the remaining reduction taking place by the end of five years. Today, to ensure that these companies remain internationally competitive, we are accelerating that plan. In addition to the one\u2011point reduction in the general corporate tax rate scheduled for this coming year, we will now legislate a two-point cut in each of the following three years. By accelerating\u2014and legislating\u2014this timetable, companies can invest with certainty, knowing precisely when, and by how much, their taxes will fall.\n[153] In the 2006 Budget, the government proposed to increase the general rate reduction percentage to 9% by January 1, 2010. In 2007, the government proposed to further increase the general rate reduction percentage to its current rate of 13% by 2012. When announcing both of these changes, the government emphasized that the purpose of the increase in the general rate reduction percentage was to reduce the general corporate income tax rate to help build a tax system that is internationally competitive.[102]\n[154] In his 2006 Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance emphasized that the rate reduction effected by section 123.4 was intended to apply to income that is taxed at the general corporate income tax rate. He noted the following:\nThe rate reductions will apply to income that is taxed at the general corporate income tax rate. This income does not include small business income that is already eligible for the small business deduction; investment income of Canadian\u2011controlled private corporations (CCPCs), which income is eligible for a special refundable tax; the income of credit unions eligible for the corporate tax rate reduction under section 137 of the Income Tax Act; and the income of mutual fund corporations, mortgage investment corporations, most deposit insurance corporations and investment corporations (as defined in the Income Tax Act), which income already qualifies for special tax treatment. Consistent with these proposals, measures will be introduced for taxation years that begin on or after May 2, 2006 to clarify that full-rate taxable income does not include any taxable income of a corporation that is not subject to tax at the general corporate income tax rate applicable under section 123 of the Income Tax Act.[103]\nConclusion on the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.4, including subparagraph 123.4(1)(b)(iii)\n[155] The Respondent argues that the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.4 is as follows:\n113. The [object, spirit and purpose] of s. 123.4 is:\nto exclude CCPC investment income from the corporate tax rate reduction available under that section because such income already benefits from a preferential corporate tax rate when the CCPC is paid the dividend refund under s. 129, and\nas with s. 123.3, to prevent Canadian-resident individual shareholders from benefitting from a tax deferral on investment income earned through a private corporation which they control directly or indirectly in any manner whatever and which they would not benefit from had they earned this income directly.\n114. Section 123.3 enhances the existing role of refundable Part I tax on aggregate investment income which ultimately does confer a benefit on a CCPC that pays out dividends. The government did not want to give the benefit of a lower tax rate to such corporations.[104]\n[156] The last paragraph of the Respondent\u2019s argument appears to be more of an argument relating to whether the Appellant has abused section 123.4 rather than an argument with respect to the object, spirit and purpose of the section.\n[157] The Appellant argues that the purpose of section 123.4 is to make Canada\u2019s business tax system more internationally competitive.\n[158] It is clear from the text of section 123.4 and the various statements made by the government when introducing and subsequently increasing the General Rate Reduction that the object, spirit and purpose of section 123.4 is to lower the general corporate tax rate, such that the highest non-refundable corporate tax rate levied under the Act is 15%. The 15% is composed of the 28% General Tax Rate minus the 13% General Rate Reduction provided for in section 123.4.\nSubsection 250(5.1)\n[159] Subsection 250(5.1) reads as follows:\nContinued corporation \u2014 Where a corporation is at any time (in this subsection referred to as the \u201ctime of continuation\u201d) granted articles of continuance (or similar constitutional documents) in a particular jurisdiction, the corporation shall\n(a) for the purposes of applying this Act (other than subsection 250(4)) in respect of all times from the time of continuation until the time, if any, of continuation in a different jurisdiction, be deemed to have been incorporated in the particular jurisdiction and not to have been incorporated in any other jurisdiction; and\n(b) for the purpose of applying subsection 250(4) in respect of all times from the time of continuation until the time, if any, of continuation in a different jurisdiction, be deemed to have been incorporated in the particular jurisdiction at the time of continuation and not to have been incorporated in any other jurisdiction.\n[160] Subsection 250(5.1) was added to the Act in 1994, with various effective dates. It applies when a corporation is continued in a particular jurisdiction. The subsection applies when a corporation that was not incorporated in Canada is continued in Canada and when a corporation that is incorporated in Canada is continued in another jurisdiction.\n[161] For example, it applied when the Appellant, which was incorporated in Canada, was continued into the British Virgin Islands.\n[162] Paragraph 250(5.1)(a) applies for purposes of applying the Act, other than subsection 250(4). Under paragraph 250(5.1)(a), the corporation is deemed in respect of all times, from the time that it was continued in the new jurisdiction, to have been incorporated in the new jurisdiction and not to have been incorporated in any other jurisdiction.\n[163] As noted in the Department of Finance\u2019s 1994 Explanatory Notes,[105] the continued corporation is treated as having been incorporated in its new home jurisdiction only for the purpose of applying the Act from the time of continuation (and only until continuation into a different jurisdiction).\n[164] Paragraph 250(5.1)(b) applies for the purposes of the deemed resident in Canada rule in subsection 250(4). Generally speaking, subsection 250(4) deems a corporation that was incorporated in Canada after April 26, 1965 to be a resident of Canada throughout a taxation year. Paragraph 250(5.1)(b) provides that for the purposes of applying subsection 250(4), the continued corporation is deemed to have been incorporated in the new jurisdiction at the time of the continuance and not to have been continued in any other jurisdiction.\n[165] Prior to the enactment of subsection 250(5.1), section 88.1 of the Act, which was enacted in 1980,[106] dealt with the continuation of a corporation. The section, which was repealed in 1994 (generally effective after 1992), read as follows:\nCorporate emigration \u2014 Where at any particular time after August 28, 1980 a corporation that was incorporated in Canada (other than a corporation that was not at any time resident in Canada)\n(a) has been granted articles of continuance (or similar corporate constitutional documents) in a jurisdiction outside Canada, or\n(b) has become resident in a jurisdiction outside Canada and would, as a consequence thereof, be exempt from tax under this Part on income from any source outside Canada derived by it after the particular time by virtue of any Act of Parliament or anything approved, made or declared to have the force of law thereunder,\nthe following rules apply:\n(c) the corporation\u2019s taxation year that would otherwise have included the particular time shall be deemed to have ended immediately before the particular time and a new taxation year of the corporation shall be deemed to have commenced at the particular time;\n(d) the corporation shall be deemed not to be a Canadian corporation at the particular time and all subsequent times;\n(e) each property owned by the corporation immediately before the particular time shall be deemed to have been disposed of by it immediately before such time for proceeds of disposition equal to its fair market value at that time and such proceeds shall be deemed to have become receivable and to have been received by it immediately before such time;\n(f) section 48 does not apply to the corporation for the taxation year in which it is deemed by paragraph (e) to have disposed of its property; and\n(g) each property deemed by paragraph (e) to have been disposed of by the corporation shall be deemed to have been reacquired by it immediately after the particular time at a cost equal to the proceeds of disposition thereof as determined in that paragraph.[107]\n[166] While current subsection 250(5.1) deals with both corporate emigration and immigration, former section 88.1 only dealt with corporate emigration.\n[167] Further, under former section 88.1, a corporation was deemed to dispose of all of its assets at fair market value upon emigrating from Canada. This deemed disposition was not included in subsection 250(5.1).[108]\n[168] The following extract from the 1979 Budget Supplementary Information indicates that section 88.1 was a response to tax planning strategies involving corporate continuances:\nCanadian corporations can avoid tax by taking steps to technically adopt residence in a jurisdiction outside Canada. Where such a transfer occurs after December 11, 1979, the corporation will be deemed to have disposed of all of its property at fair market value, thus ensuring an appropriate level of Canadian tax.[109]\n[169] However, section 88.1 resulted in unintended consequences leading to its repeal and the introduction of subsection 250(5.1) and certain concurrent amendments.\n[170] This was referred to in the 1994 Explanatory Notes, which noted the following:\nIn many jurisdictions, a company incorporated elsewhere may be naturalized by submitting to the corporate law of its new home. Such an action is often described as a corporate \u201ccontinuance\u201d or \u201ccontinuation\u201d. New subsection 250(5.1) of the Act, together with certain concurrent amendments concerning taxpayers\u2019 residence, fixes the tax consequences of continuation into a different jurisdiction. The basic principle of subsection 250(5.1) is that the continued corporation will be treated as having been incorporated in the jurisdiction into which it has continued. A corporation, for example, that was originally incorporated in Canada but was subsequently continued abroad will cease to be treated as having been incorporated in Canada, and will therefore no longer for that reason be deemed to be resident in Canada (although it may remain resident by keeping its central management and control in this country). Similarly, a corporation incorporated abroad--or incorporated in Canada and earlier continued abroad--will become resident in Canada on being continued here. \u2026[110]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[171] In his 1993 Canadian Tax Journal article, Michael J. Flatters describes some of the problems with section 88.1 as it stood at the time.[111] In particular, a corporation incorporated in Canada that was continued to another jurisdiction would lose the benefits of its \u201cCanadian corporation\u201d status, but could continue to be deemed to be a Canadian resident under subsection 250(4). This could result in the corporation being taxed as a Canadian resident even though its central management and control were not located in Canada and the corporation was continued to a foreign jurisdiction.[112] Additionally, an inbound corporation, not originally incorporated in Canada, would not be able to qualify as a \u201cCanadian corporation\u201d even if its central management and control were in Canada. [113] Mr. Flatters explains how subsection 250(5.1) could remedy the previously noted flaws with section 88.1:\nThe addition of subsection 250(5.1) and the repeal of paragraph 88.1(d) appear to deal with the asymmetrical treatment of inbound and outbound continued corporations as \u201cCanadian corporations\u201d and \u201ctaxable Canadian corporations.\u201d A corporation that was incorporated in Canada and that is continued under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction will now be regarded for the purposes of the Act as a corporation incorporated in the foreign jurisdiction from the time of continuation until any future continuation in a different jurisdiction. Conversely, a foreign corporation continued under the laws of Canada or one of its provinces will be regarded as a corporation incorporated in Canada for the purposes of the Act at all times from the time of continuance until any future continuance. \u2026[114]\n[172] In a separate 1993 Canadian Tax Journal article, Mr. Robert Couzin and Mr. Robert Dart provide a similar explanation of the problems with the former section 88.1 and the relief provided by subsection 250(5.1):\nSections 88.1 and 219.1 have had draconian and inappropriate consequences in the case of a corporate continuance of a Canadian resident corporation outside Canada. These provisions have entailed the full application of departure taxation even though conventional wisdom assumes that, at least in many cases, the continued corporation remains resident in Canada. Subsection 250(4) deems a corporation incorporated in Canada to be resident in Canada, and even a \u201ccontinued\u201d corporation appears to be properly described as \u201cincorporated\u201d in Canada. In these circumstances, the interaction of these provisions yields the unappetizing result of departure tax followed by continued Canadian taxation of the corporation as a resident corporation.\nProposed section 128.1 provides a more logical rule. Departure taxation will depend solely on change of residence. Of course, after such a change, the corporation will not be subject to part I tax as a resident. However, there remains the question how to deal with continuance.\nProposed subsection 250(5.1) provides that from the time a corporation has been granted articles of continuance in a particular jurisdiction, it will thereafter be deemed to have been incorporated in that jurisdiction and not in any other jurisdiction. The rule will apply from time to time so that serial continuances will give rise to serial deemed places of incorporation. This means that a corporation incorporated in Canada after April 26, 1965, which has been deemed to be resident in Canada by paragraph 250(4)(a), will no longer be deemed to be resident once it continues to some other jurisdiction.[115]\n[173] The deeming of a corporation under subsection 250(5.1) to be incorporated in a specific jurisdiction impacts the taxation of the corporation under the Act. Firstly, it can determine whether a corporation is resident in Canada for purposes of the Act and thus taxed on its worldwide income.\n[174] Under subsection 250(4), a corporation incorporated in Canada after April 26, 1965 is deemed to be a resident in Canada. Corporations that are resident in Canada are taxed on their worldwide income. Corporations that are not resident in Canada are only taxed on their income from Canadian sources.\n[175] Corporations that subsection 250(5.1) deems to be incorporated outside of Canada are no longer subject to the subsection 250(4) deeming rules. Such corporations will then not be considered resident in Canada unless their central management and control are located in Canada. In fact, this is the situation of the Appellant after it was continued outside of Canada. It was no longer deemed to be a resident of Canada under subsection 250(4), but remained a resident of Canada, taxed on its worldwide income, because its central management and control remained in Canada.\n[176] If the corporation is a private corporation that is resident in Canada, subsection 250(5.1) in effect determines whether the corporation may be taxed under the regime for CCPCs (corporations immigrating to Canada) or be taxed as a private corporation that is not a CCPC (corporations emigrating from Canada).\n[177] As discussed previously, in order for a corporation to be a CCPC, it must be a private corporation and a Canadian corporation. In order for a corporation to be a Canadian corporation for purposes of the Act, it must be incorporated in Canada.[116] Therefore, the effect of subsection 250(5.1) is that a CCPC that emigrates from Canada ceases to be a CCPC at the time that it is continued in another jurisdiction. It will remain a private corporation, provided that it remains a resident of Canada. Similarly, a corporation that immigrates to Canada becomes a Canadian corporation at the time that it is continued in Canada and thus is eligible to be a CCPC if it also becomes a private corporation.\n[178] As discussed previously, the status of a corporation as a Canadian corporation is important for various other provisions of the Act. For example, a corporation that loses its status as a Canadian corporation as a result of being continued in a foreign jurisdiction can no longer avail itself of the rollover provisions in section 85, the amalgamation provisions in section 87 and the wind\u2011up provisions in section 88.\n[179] As noted by the Appellant, a corporation\u2019s loss of CCPC status as a result of subsection 250(5.1) applying on the emigration of a corporation from Canada causes the corporation to have a deemed year-end and may require the corporation to add an amount to its LRIP account.\nConclusion on the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 250(5.1)\n[180] The Respondent states in his written submissions that the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 250(5.1) is not to allow an individual resident of Canada who controls a private corporation to circumvent the regime applicable to CCPC investment income.[117]\n[181] This is another instance where the Respondent\u2019s argument with respect to the object, spirit and purpose of a provision is more in the nature of an argument with respect to whether the transactions defeated the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions in issue.\n[182] The Respondent notes at paragraph 179 of his written submissions that \u201c[the government\u2019s] intent was to address anomalous and unfair results flowing from the interplay of continuations and corporate residence.\u201d\n[183] This is a statement with respect to the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 250(5.1). The Appellant agrees with this statement, but argues that it requires additional context.\n[184] It is clear from the government\u2019s action in replacing section 88.1 of the Act with subsection 250(5.1) and in making certain concurrent amendments that the rules in the Act dealing with continuation in a jurisdiction outside of Canada were not working as intended and that the continuation of a corporation into Canada needed to be addressed. It then added subsection 250(5.1) to address these issues.\n[185] The rationale of subsection 250(5.1) is to equate the place of continuance of a corporation with its place of incorporation in order to ensure that, upon the continuation of a corporation in a different jurisdiction, the various provisions of the Act that refer to the place of incorporation, such as the residence deeming rule in subsection 250(4) and the subsection 89(1) definition of Canadian corporation, produce the results intended by Parliament with respect to the taxation of the corporation under the Act.\nDid the Appellant abuse the object, spirit and purpose of the sections at issue?\n[186] Having determined the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions at issue, I must now determine whether the result of the transactions defeated or frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of these provisions.[118]\n[187] A finding of abusive tax avoidance will be made:\n-when a taxpayer relies on specific provisions of the Income Tax Act in order to achieve an outcome that those provisions seek to prevent;\n-when a transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions that are relied upon; and\n-when an arrangement circumvents the application of certain provisions, such as specific anti-avoidance rules, in a manner that frustrates or defeats the object, spirit or purpose of those provisions.[119]\n[188] Citing Copthorne at paragraph 72, the SCC noted in Deans Knight that these considerations are not independent of one another and frequently overlap.[120] The SCC emphasized that the analysis must be squarely focused on abuse, stating:\nCourts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction \u201cmust be clear\u201d (Trustco, at paras. 62 and 66; Copthorne, at para. 68; Alta Energy, at para. 33). [121]\n[189] As stated in Canada Trustco, \u201cCourts have to be careful not to conclude too hastily that simply because a non-tax purpose is not evident, the avoidance transaction is the result of abusive tax avoidance. \u2026 S. 245(4) does not consider a transaction to result in abusive tax avoidance merely because an economic or commercial purpose is not evident\u201d.[122]\n[190] The avoidance transactions in this appeal involve the transfer of the Soberlink Shares to the Appellant and the continuance of the Appellant into the British Virgin Islands. Once the Appellant was continued in the British Virgin Islands, it was no longer a CCPC.\n[191] It is clear that the purpose of these two transactions was to change the status of the Appellant from a CCPC to a private corporation that was not a CCPC, prior to the Appellant\u2019s disposition of the Soberlink Shares.\n[192] Shortly after the avoidance transactions were completed, the Appellant sold the Soberlink Shares, realizing a taxable capital gain of $1,179,648, which became part of its aggregate investment income.\n[193] Since the Appellant was not a CCPC at the time that it sold the shares, its aggregate investment income was taxed at the 15% corporate tax rate applicable to income that is not otherwise subject to a preferred tax rate. This resulted in the Appellant paying less tax than the tax that Mr. Civiero would have paid if he had been taxed personally on the sale of the shares. As a result, Mr. Civiero realized a greater after-tax return on the gain from the sale of the Soberlink Shares held by the Appellant, compared to the after-tax return that he would have obtained if he had realized the gain personally.\n[194] The personal taxation of Mr. Civiero on the gain realized from the sale of the Soberlink Shares will, in effect, be deferred until the proceeds from the sale are distributed to him by way of dividend. When this occurs, Mr. Civiero will be required to pay tax at his marginal tax rate. He will not receive the benefit of the dividend gross-up and credit scheme since the Appellant is not a Canadian corporation. In addition, the Appellant will not receive a dividend tax refund in respect of any of the Part I tax that it paid at the 15% tax rate.\n[195] If the Appellant had not carried out the avoidance transactions, its aggregate investment income would have been taxed at the 30 2\/3% rate[123] applicable to aggregate investment income under the taxing regime for CCPCs. This would have resulted in the Appellant paying tax roughly equal to the tax that Mr. Civiero would have paid if he had been taxed personally on the sale of the shares.\n[196] Because of the dividend refund mechanism, if the Appellant had remained a CCPC, the tax paid by the Appellant on its aggregate investment income under the taxing regime for a CCPC would have been reduced to 8% on the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the shares to Mr. Civiero by way of dividends. Also, if the Appellant were a CCPC, Mr. Civiero would receive the benefit of the dividend gross-up and credit system for non-eligible dividends.\n[197] In summary, the conversion of the Appellant from a CCPC to a non-CCPC resulted in Mr. Civiero, through the use of the Appellant, realizing a significant deferral of tax on the taxable capital gain realized on the sale of the Soberlink Shares. Once the proceeds of the sale are distributed to Mr. Civiero, the Appellant will pay tax at a higher rate on the taxable capital gain realized on the sale of the Soberlink Shares (15% rate compared to the 8% rate paid by a CCPC after it receives the refundable portion of the tax originally paid at the 30 2\/3% rate) than it would have paid if it had remained a CCPC. Mr. Civiero will not receive the benefit of the dividend gross-up and credit system, a benefit that he would have received if the Appellant had remained a CCPC.\n[198] Thus, Mr. Civiero executed the avoidance transactions (or directed the Appellant to execute these transactions) to realize the tax deferral that arose from having the Appellant taxed under the regime for a private company that is not a CCPC and that is not a Canadian corporation as opposed to having the Appellant taxed under the regime for CCPCs.\n[199] The question that I must answer is whether the Appellant abused the provisions of the Act at issue by carrying out the avoidance transactions in order to be taxed under the regime for a private corporation that is not a CCPC and not a Canadian corporation.\n[200] Clearly, Mr. Civiero and the Appellant took steps to realize this tax deferral. As noted previously, the SCC has affirmed on numerous occasions the Duke of Westminster principle that taxpayers can order their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable. However, as noted in Deans Knight, this principle is not absolute; it does not apply when the transactions that are intended to minimize tax result in an abuse of the provisions of the Act.[124]\nPositions of the Parties\n[201] The Respondent\u2019s allegation of abuse is summarized in paragraph 19 of his written submissions, which reads as follows:\nThe appellant misused s. 250(5.1) to circumvent the regime applicable to a CCPC\u2019s investment income, specifically s. 123.3 and the full rate taxable income definition in s. 123.4(1)(b)(iii). Parliament did not intend for s. 250(5.1) to be used to thwart that regime. The appellant also abused s. 123.3 and the full rate taxable income definition, as well as the CCPC definition in s. 125(7) and the Canadian corporation definition in s. 89(1). The object, spirit and purpose (OSP) of each of these provisions have been frustrated by allowing an individual resident of Canada to obtain a tax deferral advantage on the taxable capital gain on the Soberlink Shares.\n[202] The foundation of the Respondent\u2019s argument is that the purpose of the provisions at issue extends past CCPCs to all private companies.\n[203] The Appellant argues that once it was continued in the British Virgin Islands, it did not avoid the application of certain select provisions applicable to CCPCs; it ceased to be subject to all of the provisions of the Act applicable to CCPCs. This did not abuse any provisions of the Act since the Act \u201c(i) clearly sets out two separate codes for the taxation of private corporations that are CCPCs and those that are not, (ii) permits a corporation to change its status, and (iii) sets out the precise consequences of such a change.\u201d[125]\n[204] As discussed previously, the Act contains different taxing regimes for public corporations, CCPCs, and private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[205] The regime for CCPCs contains specific rules relating to the taxation of their business income and their investment income. The regime and rules were previously discussed in detail. I have summarized the regime in the next few paragraphs.\n[206] While private corporations that are not CCPCs pay tax on their business income at the General Tax Rate, CCPCs pay tax at both the General Tax Rate and the lower Eligible Small Business Tax Rate.\n[207] The Act contains a legislative scheme for the taxation of investment income of a CCPC that does not apply to private corporations that are not CCPCs.\n[208] The scheme is composed of two sets of rules. The first set of rules, the dividend gross-up and credit system, attempts to integrate the tax paid by a CCPC and its shareholders through the use of eligible and non-eligible dividends. While this system is available to shareholders of other corporations, it contains special rules for CCPCs. Further, the system does not apply to a private corporation, such as the Appellant, that is not a CCPC and not a Canadian corporation.\n[209] The second set of rules, which are made up of section 123.3 and the sections that provide for a CCPC\u2019s refundable portion of its Part I tax, attempts to discourage the retention of investment income in a CCPC, while maintaining the integration of tax paid by the CCPC and its shareholders. The retention of income in the CCPC postpones the tax payable at the shareholder level. This second set of rules does not apply to non-CCPCs.\n[210] The Act contains a number of other provisions that only apply to CCPCs, most of which are intended to provide benefits to CCPCs that are not available to other corporations.\n[211] I agree with the Appellant that by carrying out the avoidance transactions in order to be taxed as a private corporation that is not a CCPC, the Appellant did not abuse any of the provisions at issue.\n[212] Parliament has chosen, for policy reasons, to have different sets of rules for different corporations. For example, it has chosen to have different taxing regimes for public corporations, CCPCs, private corporations resident in Canada that are not CCPCs, corporations that are not resident in Canada, and foreign corporations that are resident in Canada.\n[213] If a corporation does a certain thing, it is transferred from one taxing regime to another. This is what occurs when a CCPC is continued in a foreign jurisdiction and moves from being a CCPC to a non-CCPC. It can also occur when a corporation that is resident in Canada takes steps to not be a resident of Canada. Once it takes such steps, it is no longer taxed under the regime for corporations resident in Canada, but rather is taxed under the regime for corporations that are not resident in Canada. Another example is when a corporation that is a taxable corporation takes steps to become an exempt corporation.\n[214] Parliament recognized that a corporation may move from the taxing regime for a CCPC to the taxing regime for a non-CCPC. This can be seen from subsection 249(3.1) and section 89.\n[215] Subsection 249(3.1) provides for a deemed year-end for a corporation that becomes or ceases to be a CCPC. The corporation\u2019s taxation year that includes the time the corporation becomes or ceases to be a CCPC is deemed to end immediately before that time.\n[216] This deemed year-end leads to consistency when applying the provisions in the Act that contain the taxing regime for CCPCs and the taxing regime for private corporations that are not CCPCs. As a result of the deemed year\u2011end, a corporation\u2019s change in status from a CCPC to a non-CCPC severs the link between the corporation\u2019s operations when it was a CCPC and its operations after it ceased to be a CCPC. Its operations prior to the deemed year-end, when it was a CCPC, are taxed under the regime for a CCPC, and its operations after the deemed year\u2011end, when it ceased to be a CCPC, are taxed under the regime for a non\u2011CCPC.\n[217] This allows for the proper application of numerous provisions of the Act whose application is conditional on the corporation either being a CCPC or not being a CCPC at a point in time or throughout a period. For example, the application of certain provisions, such as sections 123.3 and 123.4, is dependent on a corporation being a CCPC throughout the taxation year.\n[218] The deemed year-end has the same effect when a corporation that is not a CCPC becomes a CCPC.\n[219] The Act also contains transitional rules that affect a corporation\u2019s calculation of its eligible and non-eligible dividends when it either becomes or ceases to be a CCPC. The transitional rules require adjustments to either the corporation\u2019s LRIP account or its GRIP account. As discussed previously, LRIP and GRIP are part of the dividend gross-up and credit system.\n[220] A Canadian resident corporation that is not a CCPC maintains an LRIP that reflects its income that has benefited from certain preferential tax rates. The corporation cannot pay eligible dividends unless its LRIP account is zero. Subsection 89(8) contains rules that apply when a corporation ceases to be a CCPC. These rules may require a corporation to add an amount to its LRIP account.\n[221] A CCPC maintains a GRIP account that reflects its income that has not benefited from preferential tax rates. A CCPC may only pay eligible dividends to the extent of its GRIP balance. The Act contains rules in subsection 89(4) that apply when a resident corporation becomes a CCPC. These rules may require the new CCPC to add an amount to its GRIP account.\n[222] Clearly, by providing transitional rules for LRIP and GRIP accounts, Parliament recognized that a corporation could change its status from a CCPC to a non\u2011CCPC or vice versa.\n[223] In my view, the Appellant, by entering into the avoidance transaction in order to be taxed under one taxing regime put in place by Parliament as opposed to another taxing regime, did not abuse the provisions at issue. The Appellant chose to move from one taxing regime with its pluses and minuses to another taxing regime with different pluses and minuses.\n[224] On the plus side, it avoided the application of section 123.3. On the minus side, it lost access to the low Eligible Small Business Tax Rate for its business income, the refundable dividend tax credit for a portion of its tax paid at the General Tax Rate on its aggregate investment income, and the dividend gross-up and credit system. It also lost access to a number of benefits that are only available to CCPCs. Since it chose not to be a Canadian corporation, it lost the benefit of the rollover provisions in section 85 and the tax deferral rules for amalgamations and wind\u2011ups.\n[225] The avoidance transactions that resulted in the Appellant ceasing to be a CCPC did not defeat the underlying rationale of the provisions at issue or circumvent the provisions in a manner that frustrated their object, spirit or purpose.\n[226] The object, spirit and purpose of the definition of CCPC is to provide a dividing line between those corporations that are taxed under the specific regime for CCPCs and those corporations that are not taxed under this regime. Prior to being continued in the British Virgin Islands, the Appellant was on one side of the dividing line and, after it was continued, it was on the other side of the dividing line. This is exactly what Parliament intended. As just discussed, Parliament recognized that a corporation could move from one side of the dividing line to the other. It enacted provisions to facilitate this movement.\n[227] The avoidance transactions did not defeat the underlying rationale for section 123.3 or result in a circumvention of the section in a manner that frustrated its object, spirit or purpose. The object, spirit and purpose of section 123.3 is to, together with the refundable dividend tax regime and the dividend gross\u2011up and tax credit scheme, prevent the use of a CCPC to defer taxes that may be payable at a higher rate by the shareholders of the CCPC, while maintaining the integration of taxes paid by CCPCs and their shareholders. The Appellant chose to be taxed under a different scheme that Parliament established under the Act, the scheme for taxing investment income of corporations that are not CCPCs and not Canadian corporations\u2014a scheme that does not include section 123.3, the refundable dividend tax regime or the dividend gross-up or credit scheme. Regardless of the tax imposed or not imposed under the Act, the Appellant\u2019s choice to be taxed as a non\u2011CCPC did not abuse section 123.3 since Parliament only intended it to apply to a corporation\u2019s investment income that is taxed under the regime for CCPCs.\n[228] Section 123.4 also produced the result intended by Parliament. The object, spirit and purpose of section 123.4 is to lower the general corporate tax rate, such that the highest non-refundable corporate tax rate levied under the Act is 15%. Once the Appellant ceased to be a CCPC, it was no longer eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the Part I tax that it paid at the 28% General Tax Rate, under the refundable dividend tax credit rules, on the taxable investment income that it realized on the sale of the Soberlink Shares. Since the income was not eligible for any other special tax preferences, section 123.4, as intended by Parliament, lowered the tax rate to 15%, which Parliament intended to be the highest non\u2011refundable tax rate levied under the Act.\n[229] The continuation of the Appellant in the British Virgin Islands did not abuse subsection 250(5.1). The rationale of subsection 250(5.1) is to equate the place of continuance of a corporation with its place of incorporation in order to ensure that, upon the continuation of a corporation in a different jurisdiction, the various provisions of the Act that refer to the place of incorporation, such at the residence deeming rule in subsection 250(4) and the subsection 89(1) definition of Canadian corporation, produce the results intended by Parliament with respect to the taxation of the corporation under the Act.\n[230] Once the Appellant was continued in the British Virgin Islands, it was deemed to be incorporated outside of Canada, which allowed numerous other provisions to operate as intended by Parliament. For example, the Appellant was no longer deemed to be resident in Canada, no longer considered to be a Canadian corporation and no longer considered to be a CCPC.\n[231] The fact that it remained a resident in Canada did not frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 250(5.1). This was a result anticipated by the government at the time that it introduced subsection 250(5.1). The 1994 Explanatory Notes for subsection 250(5.1) specifically refer to a corporation that is continued abroad that remains a resident of Canada by keeping its central management and control in Canada.[126]\n[232] For the foregoing reasons, the result of the avoidance transactions did not defeat or frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions at issue.\n[233] The Appellant argued that if the GAAR did apply, the reassessment is statute-barred on the basis that the normal reassessment period of the Appellant in respect of the 2016 taxation year expired after three years on January 16, 2020. Since I have found that the GAAR does not apply, this issue is now moot.\n[234] In accordance with these reasons for judgment, the appeal with respect to the reassessment made under the Income Tax Act for the Appellant\u2019s taxation year ending April 30, 2016 is allowed, with costs. The reassessment is referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the Appellant\u2019s transactions, as set out in these Reasons for Judgment, did not result in abusive tax avoidance for the purposes of section 245 of the Income Tax Act.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, this 9th day of May 2024.\n\u201cS.

Introduction\n[1] The Appellant spent the better part of ten years trying to convince the Minister of National Revenue to remove over $240,000 added to her taxable income for the 2011 taxation year. Due to the passage of time, the Minister began treating the Appellant\u2019s efforts as taxpayer relief requests to reassess beyond the statutory deadline. Unfortunately, the Minister did so without fully explaining the shift to the Appellant.\n[2] The Minister partially granted the Appellant\u2019s requests for adjustments and issued three reassessments accordingly. The first reassessment explicitly informed the Appellant that she had no right to object to a reassessment issued beyond the normal reassessment period. However, the other two reassessments erroneously contained the standard information that the Appellant could file objections. The Minister compounded these errors by issuing a Notice of Confirmation indicating that the Appellant could appeal to this Court.\n[3] When the Appellant filed her appeal, the Respondent filed a motion to quash on the basis that this Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an assessment issued under the taxpayer relief provisions of the Income Tax Act.\n[4] The Appellant disagrees on the basis that she did not make taxpayer relief requests asking the Minister to reassess her beyond the normal reassessment period. While the Appellant\u2019s position in this regard is factually accurate, the Respondent\u2019s position is technically correct in law. Once the normal reassessment period for the 2011 taxation year expired, the Minister could not reassess the Appellant unless she treated the Appellant\u2019s efforts as taxpayer relief requests under paragraph 152(4.2)(a) of the Act.\n[5] There is no right of objection or appeal from reassessments issued as a result of the Minister\u2019s exercise of discretion in this regard. This remains the case even though the Canada Revenue Agency mistakenly directed the Appellant to follow the normal objection and appeal procedures.\n[6] The Respondent properly determined that the correct course of action was to ask the Court to quash the appeal, instead of filing a Reply to the Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal. Contrary to the Appellant\u2019s position in her own motion, the Respondent has not failed to comply with the applicable deadlines under the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure).\nII. Background\n[7] The procedural history of this matter is difficult because: (a) the Appellant filed numerous objections, T1 adjustment requests, and taxpayer relief requests with respect to interest and penalties; (b) the Minister issued five reassessments; and (c) at times, the CRA provided unclear, inconsistent or erroneous information to the Appellant.\n[8] The following recitation of that procedural history is necessary because neither the Appellant nor the Respondent accurately summarized the sequence of events.[1] The Appellant understandably failed to appreciate the nuances and implications of certain events in that procedural history, and denies that she made taxpayer relief requests for reassessments beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[9] However, the inaccuracies in the Respondent\u2019s Motion Record are less understandable. The Respondent\u2019s affidavit and written representations contain inaccuracies or omissions regarding relevant facts that would be apparent on a proper reading of the documents attached as exhibits to its own affidavit.[2] The biggest omission is the failure to acknowledge that the Appellant did not explicitly make a taxpayer relief request under paragraph 152(4.2)(a) of the Act.\n[10] While the Appellant\u2019s multiple requests and filings are partly responsible for the confusion, it is no wonder that she does not trust what she has been told by the CRA or the Respondent, and is seeking a resolution from this Court.\nA. The procedural history with the Canada Revenue Agency\n[11] The Appellant filed her 2011 income tax return on February 23, 2012, and the Minister issued a Notice of Assessment on March 5, 2012.[3]\n[12] By Notice of Reassessment dated November 5, 2012, the Minister reassessed the Appellant to add net business income of $247,143, resulting in a significant tax liability for the Appellant (Reassessment #1).[4]\n[13] The Minister reassessed the Appellant soon after, by Notice of Reassessment dated November 26, 2012, to make minor adjustments unrelated to the additional business income (Reassessment #2).[5]\n[14] On October 23, 2013, the Appellant filed a Request for Taxpayer Relief for cancellation or waiver of interest and penalties (Taxpayer Relief Request #1).[6] The Appellant also asked the CRA to \u201ccorrect their error in assessment for 2010 and 2011 by performing an immediate written audit\u201d.[7] But she did not tick the box for a \u201cRefund or reduction in amounts payable beyond the normal three year period (individual and testamentary trust accounts)\u201d on the Request for Taxpayer Relief form.\n[15] On February 19, 2015, the Appellant filed a T1 Adjustment Request on the basis that the CRA incorrectly added $247,143 of net business income from her husband\u2019s business to her personal taxable income.[8]\n[16] By letter dated March 10, 2015, the CRA denied the Appellant\u2019s Taxpayer Relief Request #1.[9]\n[17] By letter dated October 13, 2015, the CRA denied the Appellant\u2019s T1 Adjustment Request on the basis that no adjustments were warranted.[10]\n[18] By letter dated December 19, 2016, the CRA issued a decision denying what it referred to as the Appellant\u2019s request for a \u201crefund beyond the normal three-year reassessment period, under the taxpayer relief provisions\u201d.[11] The decision did not specify whether it was in response to a specific request made by the Appellant or explain why the CRA was now considering the Appellant\u2019s requests under this separate type of taxpayer relief.\n[19] Instead, the decision informed the Appellant that additional records were required and, if she supplied a complete application supporting her request in the future, the CRA would reopen her case and consider those documents at that time.[12]\n[20] On June 18, 2018, the Appellant made a second request for relief from interest and penalties (Taxpayer Relief Request #2).[13] In the attachments to the request, the Appellant also asked for the assessment to be vacated in full.\n[21] By decision dated June 18, 2019, the CRA partially granted the Appellant\u2019s \u201crequest regarding a refund beyond the normal three-year reassessment period, under the taxpayer relief provisions\u201d, presumably in response to Taxpayer Relief Request #2.[14] The decision specifically stated that the Appellant would not have a right to object to the reassessment issued under the taxpayer relief provisions:\nWhen we have issued a notice of reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period, there is no right of objection for a taxpayer to dispute a decision under the taxpayer relief provisions. However, if you believe that we have not exercised discretion in a fair and reasonable manner, you may request in writing that the Assistant Director, Audit Division, of the Nova Scotia Tax Services Office review the situation.\n[22] A Notice of Reassessment was subsequently issued on September 6, 2019, to reduce the Appellant\u2019s net business income by $70,865 (Reassessment #3).[15] Consistent with the June 18, 2019 decision, the notice stated that the Appellant did not have a right to object to the assessment because it was made under the taxpayer relief provisions of the Act.\n[23] The Appellant was not satisfied with her remaining tax liability and requested a review, as provided for in the June 18, 2019 decision.[16]\n[24] By decision dated November 12, 2019, the CRA allowed a further adjustment to account for an additional expense of $653.[17] The letter informed the Appellant that she could challenge the decision in the Federal Court:\nIf you feel that discretion was not properly exercised during my review of your request for relief, you can apply to the Federal Court of Canada for a judicial review within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter.\n[25] This adjustment was processed by Notice of Reassessment issued on February 10, 2020 (Reassessment #4).[18] Notwithstanding the information provided in the decision letter, the notice contained standard form information on filing an objection to the reassessment.\n[26] The Appellant followed that information and filed a Notice of Objection on March 13, 2020.[19]\n[27] By letter dated September 8, 2020, CRA Appeals informed the Appellant that a further adjustment would be made in response to her objection.[20] Although it was characterized as allowing her objection \u201cin full\u201d, the adjustment corrected an error, resulting in only a reduction of $1,306 from her net business income.\n[28] By Notice of Reassessment dated September 21, 2020, the CRA adjusted the Appellant\u2019s taxable income accordingly (Reassessment #5).[21] This notice also contained the standard form information on filing an objection if the Appellant did not agree with the reassessment. Since she still disagreed with the result, the Appellant filed another objection, by notice dated October 7, 2020.[22]\n[29] By letter dated December 9, 2020, the CRA indicated that the objection would be disallowed, but provided the Appellant thirty days to submit any additional documents or explanations.[23] The Appellant made further submissions on January 28, 2021, February 1, 2021, and February 8, 2021.[24] The CRA confirmed the September 21, 2020 reassessment by notice dated February 9, 2021.[25] The Notice of Confirmation contained the standard paragraph indicating that the Appellant could appeal to this Court within 90 days, if she disagreed with the decision.\n[30] The Appellant filed the herein appeal on May 6, 2021 with a copy of the February 9, 2021 Notice of Confirmation attached.\nB. The proceedings in this Court\n[31] After being contacted by the Court regarding the payment of the required filing fee, the Appellant filed a new Notice of Appeal and a request to waive the filing fee on September 14, 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Court issued an Order waiving the filing fee. The Registry served the Respondent with the Notice of Appeal on September 23, 2021.[26]\n[32] On November 9, 2021, the Respondent sent the Appellant a conduct letter (copied to the Court) outlining its position that the appeal could not proceed and indicating that it would be filing a motion in that regard.\n[33] Instead of filing a reply, the Respondent filed a motion in writing to quash the appeal, on November 17, 2021. In response, the Appellant asked that the motion be heard in person.[27]\n[34] On April 12, 2022, the Appellant filed her own motion seeking relief with respect to the late or non-service of the Respondent\u2019s motion to quash.\n[35] The Court made several attempts to accommodate the Appellant\u2019s request that the motions be heard in person, culminating in the matters being scheduled for hearing in Halifax on August 24, 2023. The Appellant failed to appear at the hearing due to her husband\u2019s ongoing medical condition. As a result, I ordered that the motion proceed in writing and provided the parties with time to file any additional written materials.[28]\nIII. Analysis\n[36] There are two motions to be decided. As outlined below, the Appellant\u2019s motion is dismissed and the Respondent\u2019s motion is granted.[29]\nA. The Appellant\u2019s Motion\n[37] The Appellant argues that the Respondent failed to meet deadlines under the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure). The Appellant\u2019s argument fails for a few reasons.\n[38] First, there was no deadline for the Respondent to serve its motion record, because it asked for the motion to be heard in writing, under Rule 69.[30] That Rule does not specify a deadline for service of a motion record. Instead, it set a twenty day-deadline for the Appellant to respond after being served.\n[39] Second, Rule 67 does not require personal service of the motion record. As a result, the Respondent was entitled to send the motion record by courier to the Appellant\u2019s address. The Respondent similarly was entitled to rely on the Purolator confirmation indicating that the motion record was left at the Appellant\u2019s front door on November 19, 2021.\n[40] Third, the Respondent served the Appellant a second time, when the Appellant stated that she not receive the package by courier. The Respondent engaged a process server who directly provided a copy to the Appellant\u2019s husband on January 18, 2022.[31] As a result, service occurred well in advance of the first hearing date of February 9, 2023, as required by Rule 67(6).[32]\n[41] Finally, in the event that the Appellant also takes issue with the November 22, 2021 deadline for the Respondent to file a reply to the Notice of Appeal, that deadline is currently at issue before Court.[33] In its Notice of Motion, the Respondent has asked for an extension of time to file a reply, in the event that its motion to quash the appeal is dismissed. Rule 44 allows the Respondent to ask the Court for an extension before or after the deadline to file a reply has expired. As outlined below, that extension of time is not required because the appeal cannot proceed.\nB. The Respondent\u2019s Motion to Quash\n[42] The Respondent argues that the appeal should be quashed pursuant to Rule 53(3)(a) on the basis that the Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Although I have taken issue with certain aspects of the Respondent\u2019s recitation of the relevant facts, I agree that it has accurately set out the applicable law. The interaction of various provisions of the Act removed the Appellant\u2019s right to appeal in the present case.[34]\n1. No right to appeal from reassessments issued beyond the normal reassessment period\n[43] With the definition of a \u201cnormal reassessment period\u201d, paragraph 152(3.1)(b) of the Act effectively provides a three-year deadline from the date of an original notice of assessment for the Minister to reassess a taxpayer. Since the deadline is imposed under the Act, the taxation year at issue is sometimes characterized as being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n[44] Once that deadline expires, the Minister cannot reassess a taxpayer except in the limited circumstances permitted under specific provisions in the Act.[35] Paragraph 152(4.2)(a) allows a taxpayer to request a reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period, but does not require the Minister to grant the request. It is a discretionary decision, under one of the taxpayer relief provisions in the Act.\n[45] This distinction is important because a taxpayer\u2019s appeal rights change when the Minister exercises her discretion in this regard. If the Minister grants a taxpayer\u2019s request, subsection 165(1.2) of the Act does not allow the taxpayer to object to reassessment subsequently issued.\n[46] If there is no right to object, there also is no right to appeal to this Court. Under subsection 169(1) of the Act, a taxpayer cannot appeal to the Tax Court of Canada unless they have served a notice of objection under section 165.[36]\n[47] For the 2011 taxation year, the Appellant\u2019s \u201cnormal reassessment period\u201d ended on March 5, 2015, three years after the day the Notice of Assessment issued on March 5, 2012.[37]\n[48] Once that deadline expired, the Minister treated the Appellant\u2019s requests for adjustments as taxpayer relief requests under paragraph 152(4.2)(a). This shift was first indicated in the December 19, 2016 letter from the CRA:[38]\nWe are responding to your request, regarding a refund beyond the normal three-year reassessment period, under the taxpayer relief provisions, for the above years.\nThe taxpayer relief provisions give the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) discretion to refund or reduce the amount owed beyond the normal three-year period if the request had been made on time, and provided that the necessary assessment is correct in law and has not already been allowed.\n[49] Unfortunately, the CRA did not expressly inform the Appellant that the normal reassessment period had expired and that her requests for adjustments would be considered as a taxpayer relief request under paragraph 152(4.2)(a) of the Act.\n[50] As outlined in the procedural history above, the Appellant did not explicitly make such a request.\n[51] However, to be fair to the Respondent, the shift allowed the Minister to reconsider the Appellant\u2019s adjustment requests and ultimately issue reassessments that otherwise would have been prohibited under the Act.\n[52] The following reassessments were therefore issued further to the exercise of discretion under paragraph 152(4.2)(a), after the March 5, 2015 normal reassessment deadline expired:\nReassessment #3, issued on September 6, 2019;[39]\nReassessment #4, issued on February 10, 2020;[40] and\nReassessment #5, issued on September 21, 2020.[41]\n[53] The three-year normal reassessment period did not restart with each subsequent reassessment. The deadline was fixed from the date of the original Notice of Assessment.\n[54] Based on the facts outlined and the applicable law, those three reassessments were issued further to repeated discretionary decisions to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period under paragraph 152(4.2). To conclude otherwise would invalidate the those reassessments and restore the Appellant\u2019s tax liability to Reassessment #2, issued on November 26, 2012.\n[55] As a result, this Court does not have the power to hear the Appellant\u2019s appeal.\n2. CRA errors do not change the applicable law\n[56] The above-referenced sections of the Act apply even though the CRA erroneously informed the Appellant that she could object and appeal. The law does not change even if the CRA errors led to the filing of the appeal.[42]\n[57] Reassessment #3 and the related decision indicated that the Appellant would not have a right to object because the reassessment was issued under the taxpayer relief provisions:\nAs we explained in our recent letter, we changed your return. Before, you had to ask for a change within three years of the date we mailed you the notice of assessment for that return. But now, the taxpayer relief provisions of the Income Tax Act lets us make changes past the usual three years. Since we allowed the change under these provisions, you cannot file an objection to this reassessment.[43]\n[58] Unfortunately, Reassessment #4 did not contain a similar statement and erroneously contained the standard form information on filing an objection. It was the third option under the heading \u201cIf you do not agree with this reassessment\u201d:\n3. You can object to this reassessment\nIf you do not agree with this notice, you can object to it. You can do this by going to canada.ca\/guide-my-cra-account, or by sending either Form T400A, Objection \u2013 Income tax Act, or a signed letter to the Chief of Appeals. You can find the address in Appendix B in Pamphlet P148, Resolving Your Dispute: Objections and Appeal Rights under the Income Tax Act.[44]\n[59] I will refer to this information as \u201cCRA Error #1\u201d.\n[60] The CRA compounded this error by accepting the Appellant\u2019s subsequent Notice of Objection, dated March 13, 2020.[45] This was CRA Error #2.\n[61] Reassessment #5, issued on September 21, 2020 to make a minor adjustment contained CRA Error #3 in that it again included the standard form information on filing an objection.[46]\n[62] CRA Error #4 occurred when the agency accepted the Appellant\u2019s subsequent Notice of Objection dated October 7, 2020, and invited her to make submissions in support of further adjustments.[47]\n[63] CRA Error #5 occurred when the agency issued the Notice of Confirmation, dated February 9, 2021, with instructions on appealing to the Tax Court of Canada within 90 days, if the Appellant disagreed with the decision:[48]\nAccording to section 169 of the Income Tax Act, if you disagree with this decision, you may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada within 90 days from the date of this notice of confirmation. For information on how to file an appeal, see the publication RC4443-2. You can also get up to date information by going to the Tax Court of Canada website at tcc-cci.gc.ca.\n[64] That information was repeated in a letter dated March 11, 2021 (CRA Error #6).[49] Unsurprisingly, the Appellant filed the herein appeal on May 6, 2021, with respect to Reassessment #5.\n[65] The Respondent acknowledges that the CRA erred in considering the Notice of Objection and issuing the Notice of Confirmation.[50] While this acknowledgment understates the number of errors and failures to properly communicate with the Appellant, the outcome of this motion does not change.\n[66] As recently outlined by this Court in Dutka, even when incorrect information is provided by the CRA, I am required to apply the provisions of the Act.[51] This principle has been applied in several cases where the end result is that a taxpayer is prevented from objecting to, or appealing from, a reassessment.\n[67] As a result, the appeal cannot proceed.\n[68] As outlined in the CRA\u2019s decision dated November 12, 2019, the Appellant\u2019s proper recourse is to challenge the taxpayer relief decisions, rather than the reassessments subsequently issued. This is done by way of application for judicial review in the Federal Court rather than an appeal to this Court. This Court does not have the power to hear challenges to the Minister\u2019s exercise of discretion under the taxpayer relief provisions of the Act.[52]\nIV. Conclusion\n[69] The Appellant followed guidance provided by the CRA in various decisions and notices. Because the CRA re-characterized her requests and provided unclear and inconsistent information, she did not understand that she was challenging the Minister\u2019s decisions in the wrong court.\n[70] While the Respondent properly moved to quash the appeal before any further unnecessary steps were taken in the proceeding, counsel could have taken more care to provide a clear explanation to the Appellant. This was particularly important considering that, contrary to the most recent information provided to the Appellant by the CRA, she has no right to appeal to this Court.\n[71] The Appellant\u2019s motion is dismissed and the Respondent\u2019s motion is granted, both without costs. The Appellant\u2019s appeal from the Notice of Reassessment dated September 21, 2020 for the 2011 taxation year is quashed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of May 2024.\n\u201cJoanna Hill\u201d\nHill J.\nAppendix A\nTax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR\/90-688a\nService of Documents\n35 (1) No document need be served personally, unless these rules or a direction require personal service.\n(2) Any document that is not required to be served personally, may be served at the address for service of the party.\nService at Address for Service\n38 (1) The address for service of a party shall be,\n\u2026\n(c) in the case of any other party, where there is no counsel of record, the address of the party as shown on the last document filed by the party that shows his or her address, being a place within Canada, or\n\u2026\n(2) Service of a document at an address for service may be made,\n(a) by mailing the document to the address for service, or\n(b) by leaving the document at the address for service.\nTime for Delivery of Reply to Notice of Appeal\n44 (1) A reply shall be filed in the Registry within 60 days after service of the notice of appeal unless\n\u2026\n(b) the Court allows, on application made before or after the expiration of the 60-day period, the filing of that reply after the 60-day period within a specified time.\n\u2026\n(3) A reply shall be served\n(a) within five days after the 60-day period prescribed under subsection (1);\n(b) within the time specified in a consent given by the appellant under subsection (1); or\n(c) within the time specified in an extension of time granted by the Court under subsection (1).\nStriking out a Pleading or other Document\n53 (3) On application by the respondent, the Court may quash an appeal if\n(a) the Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal;\n(b) a condition precedent to instituting an appeal has not been met; or\n(c) the appellant is without legal capacity to commence or continue the proceeding.\nNotice of Motion\n65 All interlocutory or other applications shall be made by a notice of motion.

There are no details regarding this objection and Notice of Confirmation in either party\u2019s motion materials or submissions.\n[4] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit A.\n[5] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit A.\n[6] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit B.\n[7] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit B.\n[8] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit C.\n[9] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit D.\n[10] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit E.\n[11] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit F.\n[12] Documents attached to Exhibit G, the Appellant\u2019s 2017 Tax Court of Canada Application for an extension of time to object, has copies of Appellant\u2019s correspondence with CRA in this regard dated July 6, 2016.\n[13] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit I: Request for Taxpayer Relief \u2013 Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest\n[14] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit J.\n[15] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit K.\n[16] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit L. This CRA decision letter refers to the Appellant\u2019s \u201c2nd Level Taxpayer Relief Request\u201d. Contrary to paragraph 4 of the Respondent\u2019s Amended Written Representations, the Appellant did not file an objection to the September 6, 2019 Notice of Reassessment. Instead, she requested a second level review as instructed by the CRA decision letter dated June 18, 2019. The CRA decision in response to that review led to the September 21, 2020 Reassessment.\n[17] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit L.\n[18] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit M.\n[19] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit N.\n[20] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit O.\n[21] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit P.\n[22] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit Q.\n[23] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit R.\n[24] See the text of the Appellant\u2019s letter dated February 8, 2021, Barry Affidavit, Exhibit S. Contrary to paragraph 22 of the Barry Affidavit, this document is not a Notice of Objection. Rather the Appellant was responding directly to the author of the CRA\u2019s December 9, 2020 letter with reference to the same case number.\n[25] Barry Affidavit, Exhibit T. By letter dated March 11, 2021 (Barry Affidavit, Exhibit U), the CRA informed the Appellant that her correspondence dated February 8, 2021 could not be accepted as a valid objection because CRA Appeals had already reviewed and confirmed the October 7, 2020 objection. It is not clear why the CRA considered the February 8, 2021 letter as a separate objection in light of the entire chain of communication and the contents of the letter.\n[26] Tax Court of Canada Certificate of Service, Court file.\n[27] Appellant\u2019s correspondence dated January 26, 2022, Court file.\n[28] Order dated August 28, 2023.\n[29] Since the substantive issue regarding the correctness of the assessment was not properly at issue in these motions, I did not consider the Appellant\u2019s arguments and evidence in support of her claim for further reductions to her taxable income for 2011.\n[30] Respondent\u2019s Notice of Motion, dated November 17, 2021.

Hogan\u201d\nHogan J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 7\nDate: 20240116\nDocket: 2022-848(GST)I\nBETWEEN:\nUN1QUE PRODUCTIONS INC.,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nHogan J.\n[1] This is an appeal from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1] disallowing input tax credits (\u201cITC\u201d) in the amount of $6,690 claimed by the Appellant, Un1que Productions Inc. (\u201cUPI\u201d), for the reporting periods from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015, July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016, July 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 and January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 (the \u201cRelevant Periods\u201d).\n[2] The Minister disallowed the ITCs on the grounds, inter alia, that, during the Relevant Periods, (i) the Appellant was not engaged in a commercial activity; (ii) the claims related to personal expenses of Mr. Christie, the sole shareholder and officer of UPI; and, (iii) the Appellant had failed to obtain and retain documentation in support of the ITC claims as required under subsection 169(4) of the Act and the Regulations.\n[3] UPI defends the contrary position.\n[4] Mr. Christie acted as the agent of UPI for the purposes of its appeal and also appeared as its sole witness.\n[5] By way of background information, Mr. Christie explained how UPI came into existence in or around 2013. Initially, Mr. Christie\u2019s goal was to earn a living in the music industry. His initial experience was disappointing. Mr. Christie testified that he met unsavoury individuals who tried to take advantage of his lack of experience. Mr. Christie alleges that he decided to incorporate UPI to shield himself from personal liability and to explore ways of earning income from a broader sector of activities.\n[6] Mr. Christie explained that, at all material times, his sole source of income was limited to the money and benefits that he receives under the Ontario Disability Support Program (\u201cODSP\u201d). Since inception to the present date, UPI has earned no revenue. Notwithstanding Mr. Christie\u2019s best efforts, UPI has been unable to raise capital or obtain third party financing to fund its activities. Mr. Christie seeks to fund UPI\u2019s activities through the ITC refund claims that have been submitted but disallowed.\n[7] Mr. Christie testified that he views UPI as his alter ego because everything that he does, broadly speaking, will advantage UPI in the long term. Moreover, he was forthright on direct questioning, acknowledging that many of the expenses incurred for goods could indeed be used to satisfy his personal needs.[2] For example, when questioned on cross\u2011examination as to why he submitted an ITC claim in respect of the costs of clothing, food and snacks, Mr. Christie explained that one cannot become active in business without a proper wardrobe.[3]\n[8] At the outset of the hearing, I pointed out to Mr. Christie that, under paragraph 169(1)(b) of the Act, ITCs can only be claimed to the extent to which a registrant has acquired property or services for consumption, use or supply in the course of a commercial activity.\n[9] The term \u201ccommercial activity\u201d is defined as follows in subsection 123(1) of the Act:\n. . .\n\u201ccommercial activity\u201d of a person means\n(a) a business carried on by the person (other than a business carried on without a reasonable expectation of profit by an individual, a personal trust or a partnership, all of the members of which are individuals), except to the extent to which the business involves the making of exempt supplies by the person,\n(b) an adventure or concern of the person in the nature of trade (other than an adventure or concern engaged in without a reasonable expectation of profit by an individual, personal trust or a partnership, all of the members of which are individuals), except to the extent to which the adventure or concern involves the making of exempt supplies by the person, and\n(c) the making of a supply (other than an exempt supply) by the person of real property of the person, including anything done by the person in the course of or in connection with the making of the supply.\n[Emphasis added are my own.]\n[10] The definition of a \u201cbusiness\u201d is found in subsection 123(1) of the Act and reads as follows:\n\u201cbusiness\u201d includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit, and any activity engaged in on a regular or continuous basis that involves the supply of property by way of lease, license or similar arrangement, but does not include an office or employment.\n[Emphasis added are my own.]\n[11] The use of the word \u201cincludes\u201d means that the definition of a business is not exhaustive. The determination of what constitutes the carrying on of a business in the course of a commercial activity is an inherently factual determination. That is why the Act does not have a comprehensive definition of what constitutes a business. What constitutes a concern or adventure in the nature of a trade is undefined in the Act for a similar reason. Parliament has left it up to the courts to identify the relevant factors to identify whether a business or a concern or adventure in the nature of a trade exists or not.\n[12] Parliament has adopted the same approach under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d) for the purpose of determining whether a business is carried on as a source of income. The definition of a business uses the word \u201cincludes\u201d which implies that the definition is not exhaustive.[4] Subsection 9(1) of the ITA provides that a taxpayer\u2019s income from a business is the taxpayer\u2019s profit from the business for the year. Similarly, paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA provides that an outlay or expense can only be deducted, to the extent that, it was made or incurred for the purpose of earning income. Since the concept of a \u201cbusiness\u201d is not exhaustive, the Courts have identified a number of factors to be considered to determine whether actions or activities that have a personal element constitute the carrying on of a business for the purposes of subsection 9(1) and paragraph 18(1)(a) of the ITA. These factors are applied in most cases when activities are carried on directly by an individual. As a general rule, corporations are viewed as carrying on commercial activities. That said, owner shareholders often treat corporations as their alter ego. They have difficulty delineating personal expenses and personal activities from business expenses and business activities.\n[13] In Stewart v. Canada,[5] the Supreme Court of Canada (\u201cSCC\u201d) considered and set aside the concept of \u201ca reasonable expectation of profit\u201d[6] as a factor to consider in determining whether a business exists and expenses or losses are deductible against net sources of income. This concept was developed in Moldowan v R,[7] an earlier decision of the SCC. In Stewart, the SCC confirmed that the other factors identified in Moldowan should be considered in determining whether actions and activities that have a personal element constitute the carrying on of a business as a source of income for the purpose of the ITA.\n[14] The relevant factors for distinguishing elements of a personal nature from activities that are undertaken in the course of a business include: (1) the profit and loss experiences in past years; (2) the taxpayer\u2019s training; (3) the taxpayer\u2019s intended course of action; and (4) the capability of the venture to show a profit.[8] In Stewart, the SCC noted that those four factors are not exhaustive, and that the factors will differ with the nature and extent of the activities.\n[15] I will consider the factors noted above in the present case, because they are useful in determining whether the actions Mr. Christie claimed were personal activities of himself rather than commercial activities of the Appellant.\n[16] I have chosen to focus on Mr. Christie\u2019s actions and activities as he is the sole person who, allegedly, has acted on behalf of UPI. Undoubtedly, Mr. Christie\u2019s interest lies in the realm of music, film and audiovisual production and presentation and beyond. Persons can carry out these activities because they enjoy them. These same activities can also be undertaken in the context of a business carried on personally or through a corporation.\n[17] I recognize that a business can exist well before the time that revenue is earned. All businesses have a start\u2011up phase, which can be short or long, depending on the nature of the venture. Generally speaking, persons involved during the start\u2011up phase of a venture have a well thought\u2011out business plan, have identified the specific products or services that will be marketed and sold and have identified a target audience for their services and products. Similarly, they will undertake activities to finance their activities.\n[18] In disallowing the Appellant\u2019s ITC claims on the grounds that UPI had not carried on a commercial activity during the Relevant Periods, the Minister relied, inter alia, on the following assumptions of fact: (i) the Appellant had no target industry, clients or expectation of receiving any revenue; (ii) the Appellant took no steps to market a product for sale; and, (iii) the Appellant has not reported any income or expenses on its T2 income tax returns.[9]\n[19] The evidence presented by the Appellant falls well short of demonstrating that any of the aforementioned steps have been undertaken by Mr. Christie on behalf of the Appellant before and during the Relevant Period. In my opinion, Mr. Christie\u2019s actions and activities appear to lie within the personal realm. His actions, at best, amount to exploring how things of a personal interest to him may one day be carried on by UPI as a business.\n[20] I am also of the opinion that the expenses submitted by the Appellant in support of its ITCs are personal expenses of Mr. Christie.[10] The Minister assumed that this was the case in disallowing the Appellant\u2019s ITC claims.[11] The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the Minister\u2019s assumption of fact in this regard is incorrect. A registrant cannot claim ITCs in respect of the personal expense of its sole officer and shareholder.[12]\n[21] For all of these reasons, the Appellant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of January 2024.\n\u201cRobert J.

Introduction: [1] The Appellant, Ahmadiyya Abode of Peace Inc., based in North York, operates a 166-unit non-profit housing project, and participates in a municipal housing stability service program. The Appellant is not a registrant under the federal Excise Tax Act (Act).\n[2] The Appellant appeals two assessments under the Act, each made by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) on January 16, 2019. These two assessments assessed as nil each of two GST\/HST rebates of $29,027.60 and $33,592.75, applied for by the Appellant in its two GST\/HST Public Service Bodies\u2019 rebate applications (PSB rebate application(s)). These PSB rebate applications were both filed January 11, 2019 with the Minister.\n[3] The issue is whether those two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications constituted, as claimed by the Appellant, amendments to a PSB rebate application the Appellant had filed June 23, 2016.\nII. Background: [4] On June 23, 2016, the Appellant filed with the Minister a PSB rebate application seeking a GST\/HST rebate of $62,620.35, for a claim period identified as January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.\n[5] Subsections 297(1) and (2) of the Act read:\n(1) Assessment of rebate - On receipt of an application made by a person for a rebate under section 215.1 or Division VI, the Minister shall, with all due dispatch, consider the application and assess the amount of the rebate, if any, payable to the person.\n(2) Reassessment - The Minister may reassess or make an additional assessment of the amount of a rebate, notwithstanding any previous assessment of the amount of the rebate.\n[6] As required by subsection 297(1), the Minister considered this (Division IV) PSB rebate application of June 23, 2016. Then, on July 20, 2016, the Minister assessed the appropriate rebate as nil. The resultant July 20, 2016 notice of assessment explained that the rebate was assessed as nil because the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application had not identified a correct claim period, as defined in the Act.\n[7] The term \u201cclaim period\u201d is defined in subsection 259(1) of the Act as follows:\n\u201cclaim period\u201d of a person at any time means\n(a) where the person is at that time a registrant, the reporting period of the person that includes that time, and\n(b) in any other case, the period that includes that time and consists of either\n(i) the first and second fiscal quarters in a fiscal year of the person, or\n(ii) the third and fourth fiscal quarters in a fiscal year of the person;\n[8] In accordance with this definition and noting that the Appellant was not a registrant and its fiscal year was the calendar year, the Appellant\u2019s correct claim periods for 2014 were two-fold, i.e. two six-month periods being January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014 and July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. As stated the Appellant in its June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application had wrongly claimed for single claim period, being the twelve-month period of January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.\n[9] At the hearing, the Appellant\u2019s manager, Mr. Karim Tahir, testified that the Appellant did not receive the July 20, 2016 notice of assessment. He said he opens the mail himself. However, the Appellant did not dispute that the July 20, 2016 notice of assessment was correctly addressed to the Appellant and that Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) had not received any returned mail from that address. There was no indication that the Appellant had disputed that the July 20, 2016 notice of assessment had been mailed.[1]\n[10] In any event, the Appellant did not file a notice of objection regarding the July 20, 2016 assessment. Subsection 301(1.1) of the Act provides that a notice of objection may be filed within 90 days following the date the assessment to be objected to was sent.\n[11] As well, subsection 303(7) of the Act allows a period of a year following the expiry of the said 90 days within which to apply for an extension of time to file a notice of objection. The Appellant made no such application, with that further period of one year expiring on October 18, 2017.\n[12] Mr. Tahir testified that in 2017, he became aware that the Appellant had not received the applied-for 2014 rebate. It was in October of the following year \u2013 2018 - that he enquired of this to CRA. He was told he was not a representative of the Appellant with whom CRA was authorized to communicate.\n[13] Mr. S. Formusa, the Appellant\u2019s outside accountant, also testified. He stated that in late 2018 he, the Appellant\u2019s appointed CRA contact, communicated with CRA regarding the \u201cmissing\u201d 2014 rebate. He then learned that the rebate due in respect of the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application (having the wrongly stated claim period), had been assessed July 20, 2016 as nil.\n[14] His evidence was that likewise the GST\/HST rebates the Appellant had applied for, for claim periods for 2015 and 2016, had not been received. He testified that the Appellant was able to successfully resolve the 2015 and 2016 rebate claims by filing what he termed were \u201camended\u201d PSB rebate applications for correctly stated claim periods. No documentation regarding this was entered in evidence and these rebate applications are not in issue.\n[15] As stated, on January 11, 2019 the Appellant filed the two PSB rebate applications pertaining to 2014 claim periods. The Appellant submits that these applications were amendments to the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application that had resulted in the nil assessment of July 20, 2016.\n[16] One of these two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications sought a rebate of $29,027.60 for the claim period of January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014. The other sought a rebate of $33,592.75 for the claim period of June 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. Mr. Formusa testified that he had not realized that in the application for the latter claim period he had mistakenly identified that claim period as commencing June 1, 2014, rather than July 1, 2014.\n[17] Paragraph 259(5)(b) of the Act provides that for non-registrants, such as is the Appellant, a PSB rebate application for a claim period must be filed within four years after the last day of that claim period.\n[18] Paragraph 259(5)(b) reads as follows:\n(5)(b) \u2013 Application for rebate [deadline] \u2013 A rebate under this section in respect of a claim period in a fiscal year of a person shall not be paid to the person unless the person files an application for the rebate after the first day in that year that the person is a selected public service body, charity or qualifying non-profit organization and within four years after the day that is...where the person is not a registrant, the last day of the period.\n[19] Thus, the four-year filing deadlines for these two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications were respectively, June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. Accordingly, these PSB rebate applications filed January 11, 2019 were both filed after the expiry of those paragraph 259(5)(b) deadlines.\n[20] It was for that reason that on January 16, 2019, in response to the two January 11, 2019 rebate applications, the Minister assessed the sought rebate amounts as nil. As well, the Minister\u2019s nil assessment of the rebate applied for on January 11, 2019 respecting the claim period ending December 31, 2014 was based also on the reason that that claim period had been wrongly expressed as commencing June 1, 2014; not July 1, 2014.\n[21] On the following day, January 17, 2019, the Appellant filed another PSB rebate application for $33,592.75 for the latter claim period, this time correctly identifying its commencement date as July 1, 2014.\n[22] Less than a week later, on January 23, 2019, the Minister assessed as nil the permitted rebate sought by that January 17, 2019 rebate application, for the familiar reason that the application had been filed after the expiry of the applicable four\u2011year limitation period.\n[23] On February 19, 2019, the Appellant, per subsection 301(1.1) of the Act, filed a notice of objection respecting each of the two January 16, 2019 assessments.\n[24] On November 15, 2019, the Minister confirmed both of the objected-to January 16, 2019 assessments, on the basis that the two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications giving rise to those assessments were filed after expiry of the pertinent four-year limitation periods, and so could not have been amendments of the July 20, 2016 assessment.\n[25] The two notices of confirmation, signed by CRA Appeals Officer Mr. Navpreet Bains on behalf of the Minister, stated also that the late-filed January 11, 2019 rebate applications \u201ccould not have been amendments to the initial application because they were for two distinct claim periods as defined in subsection 259(1)...\u201d.\n[26] Mr. Bains\u2019 notices of confirmation stated also that the two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications were \u201clate filed\u201d and so could not be considered, \u201cregardless of the circumstances\u201d.\n[27] In its Notice of Appeal to this Court, the Appellant pleads that its two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications were amendments of its June 23, 2016 rebate application; and as well that its January 17, 2019 PSB rebate application amended the claim period erroneously expressed as commencing June 1, 2014.\n[28] In argument, Appellant\u2019s counsel referenced a brief CRA document dated September 11, 2014 and entitled \u201cAdjust a Return or Rebate\u201d. It includes the following statements:\nUsing CRA\u2019s \u201cMy Business Account\u201d, a person can \u201cask for an adjustment to an assessed public services bodies\u2019 (PSB) rebate claim.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to adjust another type of rebate, send your request in writing to the Prince Edward Island Tax Centre.\u201d\n\u201cOnce you have a user ID and password, sign into My Business Account and select the \u201cAdjust a PSB rebate\u201d option. You will then be presented with a list of periods that are eligible for electronic adjustment. You will then be able to enter your updated information on screens\u2026\u201d (underlining added)\n[29] According to this, a person can ask for an adjustment to an assessed PSB rebate claim, for a claim period that is \u201celigible for\u2026adjustment\u201d. The way of doing this as per the Act is to file a notice of objection. There is no guidance in this September 2014 government document that counsel put forward as to what makes a claim period \u201celigible for adjustment\u201d. Of course, it could not be anything inconsistent with the Act.\n[30] Appellant\u2019s counsel also referenced a CRA publication entitled \u201cGST\/HST Public Service Bodies\u2019 Rebate\u201d. On its front page is stated, \u201c[t]his guide uses plain language to explain the most common tax situations. It is provided for information only and does not replace the law.\u201d As well there is a short discussion on page 11 under the heading, \u201cHow to make changes to a rebate application you already filed\u201d. It reads:\nIf you need to change a rebate [application] that you have already filed, you can:\n-use the CRA's digital services in My Business Account at canada.ca\/my-cra-business-account or Represent a Client at canada.ca\/taxes-representatives\n-send us a letter indicating the change. (underlining added)\n[31] It basically says that if a taxpayer files a rebate application and subsequently realizes that a wrong statement was made in it, the taxpayer can simply write a letter identifying the requested correction. That seems fine, particularly if before any assessment as to the proper rebate. But, that did not happen here, to correct the claim period description. Again, obviously this informal flexibility would be subject to provisions of the Act. As the document itself says, its statements \u201cdo not replace the law\u201d.\n[32] I note that neither of these CRA documents uses either of the terms \u201camend\u201d and \u201camendment\u201d.\nIII. Parties\u2019 Positions: [33] The Appellant\u2019s position is that the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application was amended by the two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications (plus the January 17, 2019 PSB rebate application). The Appellant submits that this leads to the result that the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application should be reassessed as accepting the applied-for rebate for each of the two correct 2014 claim periods. The result would be that June 23, 2016 would become the date of the PSB rebate application for the correct claim periods and associated rebate claims that actually were filed January 11, 2019. Unlike the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application, the January 11, 2019 and January 17, 2019 rebate applications were, as noted, filed past the applicable four-year limitation periods.\n[34] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the two January 11, 2019 PSB rebate applications were not amendments. They are what they say they are \u2013 PSB rebate applications, and as such filed beyond the applicable four-year limitation dates of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.\nIV. Analysis: [35] The question is whether the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application for a rebate of $60,620.35, which application the Minister on July 20, 2016 considered and then assessed the appropriate rebate as nil, and which assessment was not objected to, can on January 11, 2019 be amended and then re-considered?\n[36] The following provisions of the Act speak to the (using my word), \u201cfinality\u201d aspect of PSB rebate applications and resultant rebate assessments.\n[37] Subsections 262(1) and (2) of the Act provide:\n(1) Form and filing of [rebate] application - An application for a rebate under this Division (other than section 253) shall be made in prescribed form containing prescribed information and shall be filed with the Minister in prescribed manner.\n(2) Single application - Only one application may be made under this Division for a rebate with respect to any matter.\n[38] In Fanshawe College of Applied Arts v. The Queen, 2006 TCC 652, Woods JTCC as she then was, opined that in subsection 262(2) the word \u201cmatter\u201d means \u201ctransaction\u201d.[2] The provision accordingly provides that only one GST\/HST application for a rebate can be made in respect of any transaction.\n[39] Additionally, subsections 299(3) and (4) of the Act state:\n(3) Assessment valid and binding - An assessment, subject to being vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a reassessment, shall be deemed to be valid and binding.\n(4) Assessment deemed valid \u2013 An assessment shall, subject to being reassessed or vacated as a result of an objection or appeal under this Part, be deemed to be valid and binding, notwithstanding any error, defect or omission therein or in any proceeding under this Part relating thereto. (underlining added)\n[40] Subsection 299(3) establishes, and subsection (4) iterates, that an assessment is, \u201cvalid and binding\u201d. It remains so pending the PSB rebate applicant filing in timely fashion a notice of objection to that assessment.\n[41] Filing a notice of objection is the first step in seeking that a valid and binding assessment be reassessed or vacated. The Minister may agree with the objection and reassess or vacate accordingly. Should the Minister not agree with the objection, the objecting PSB may appeal the assessment to this Court, seeking that this Court vacate the assessment or order that the Minister reassess on a basis specified by the Court.\n[42] Apart from these options, which only could arise upon a notice of objection having been filed, the Minister\u2019s assessment remains valid and binding \u2013 this, per subsection 299(4), \u201cnotwithstanding any error, defect or omission therein or in any proceeding under this Part relating thereto.\u201d\n[43] The Appellant\u2019s June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application led to the July 20, 2016 assessment, which assessment (of nil rebate) is valid and binding, as it was not objected to. As for the June 23, 2016 PSB rebate application, it is spent \u2013 it has no further role.\n[44] The Act has no role for a PSB rebate application once it has led to the ministerial rendering of an assessment as to quantum of rebate for the claim period identified in that application. The assessment is \u201cvalid and binding\u201d, subject only to being vacated or reassessed; neither of which could happen without a notice of objection having been filed.\n[45] Thus, with no notice of objection having been filed, the July 20, 2016 assessment remains valid and binding. The Act does not contemplate that the rebate application that led to that assessment subsequently being amended or otherwise altered. That would be meaningless, with the assessment it had prompted remaining valid and binding.\n[46] As well, any ability to amend an otherwise spent PSB rebate application, in seeking a different assessment, contemplates the complete sidestepping of the Act\u2019s notice of objection process.\n[47] The Act recognizes that, while allowing for the notice of objection process, there must be finality to the GST\/HST PSB rebate assessment process.\n[48] In Fanshawe College, Justice Woods observed that in addressing errors underlying PSB rebate assessments, the proper procedure is the filing a notice of objection:\nThe proper way to adjust for these errors is to object to the assessments for the claim periods in which the errors were made. This was not done and, as the Crown noted in its argument, these assessments are now deemed to be valid by virtue of section 299(3).[3] (underlining added)\n[49] Thus, this provision forbids the use of further rebate applications to supposedly amend an earlier rebate application. The \u201camendment\u201d here sought is not an amendment but rather a complete substitution of the 2019 application(s) for the 2016 one. They are new applications pertaining to the same transactions \u2013 as such forbidden by subsection 262(2).\n[50] In closing I briefly address the Minister\u2019s reason for denying the January 11 and 17, 2019 rebate applications as amendments. In my view a rebate application filed prior to passage of the paragraph 259(5)(b) four-year deadline for so filing could incidentally be amended post deadline, although prior to the Minister having assessed in respect of that application. Upon the Minister having assessed, and should a concern exist \u2013 it is not the spent rebate application to be addressed but rather, the valid and binding assessment, by way of notice of objection.\nV. Conclusion: [51] In conclusion, this appeal will be dismissed, with costs.\nSigned at Halifax, Nova Scotia this 15th day of May 2024.\n\u201cB.

Background A. History of the Company [4] Brown\u2019s Paving Ltd. (\u201cBPL\u201d) carries on a paving business in New Brunswick. The business was started by the Appellant\u2019s grandfather and has been passed down through the generations since 1957.\n[5] Following her grandfather\u2019s death, BPL passed to the Appellant\u2019s father, Wallace Brown, and her uncle, Calvin Brown. Following Calvin Brown\u2019s death in the late 1990s, Wallace Brown became the sole shareholder of BPL.\nB. Bringing in the Next Generation [6] Around that time, Wallace Brown brought his nephew, Corey McAllister, into the business. Mr. McAllister is the son of one of Wallace Brown\u2019s sisters. Calvin Brown had handled the sales and estimates side of the business. That was not one of Wallace Brown\u2019s strengths and he wanted to bring in someone who could fill that roll. Mr. McAllister had recently graduated from a college civil engineering program, had previously worked for BPL and had work experience in asphalt testing. Wallace Brown felt that Mr. McAllister would be an asset to the business.\n[7] Around this same time, the Appellant, who was in high school, began working for BPL. As was her father\u2019s wish, the Appellant started at the bottom with the plan of experiencing every aspect of the business.\n[8] While in high school, the Appellant worked summers, first as a road flagger on a patching crew and later as a labourer. After graduation, she began working full-time for BPL as a heavy equipment operator. The Appellant told her father that she wanted to eventually take over the business.\n[9] To better position herself for the future, the Appellant enrolled in a two-year business program. She continued working at BPL in the summers and returned to working there full-time after she graduated. At that point she began running a patching crew and doing job estimates. She used her new business knowledge to help her father better track BPL\u2019s assets and better understand the company\u2019s finances.\n[10] The Appellant eventually determined that a degree from a two year civil engineering program focusing on the types of work that BPL did would benefit her. Mr. McAllister had a similar degree and the Appellant could see its benefits. While she pursued that degree, she worked for BPL during the intervening summer. She returned to BPL full-time after she graduate in 2005. Her duties then expanded to include road surveying, soil sampling and testing and the implementation of a company-wide safety program to ensure compliance with new government regulations.\nC. Stake in the Future [11] In 2007, both Mr. McAllister and the Appellant independently spoke to Wallace Brown about taking an ownership stake in BPL.\n[12] Mr. McAllister expressed that he had been with BPL for about 10 years and wanted to be a part of the company\u2019s future. He pushed Wallace Brown to let him buy shares.\n[13] The Appellant reaffirmed to her father that she would like to eventually take over the business. He expressed to the Appellant that he was pleased with that idea but felt that the Appellant would benefit from Mr. McAllister\u2019s continuing involvement. He proposed issuing shares to both of them.\nD. Estate Freeze [14] As a result of these conversations, in 2007, Wallace Brown entered into an estate freeze whereby he exchanged his common shares of BPL for Class B non-voting preferred shares redeemable for an amount equal to the fair market value of BPL at the time of the freeze and 1,000 Class A voting preferred shares.\n[15] On the same day, Wallace Brown, the Appellant and Mr. McAllister subscribed for 20 Class A common shares, 40 Class B common shares and 40 Class C common shares respectively.\n[16] While Wallace Brown gave up much of his stake in the future growth of BPL, as a result of his voting preferred shares, he continued to control the company.\nE. Significant Growth [17] By 2013, BPL had undergone significant growth. At the Appellant\u2019s and Mr. McAllister\u2019s insistence, the company had made substantial investments in additional equipment and had approximately doubled its workforce. As a result, it had also doubled its revenues.\n[18] Just as Mr. McAllister\u2019s and the Appellant\u2019s involvement in the business had grown, Wallace Brown\u2019s involvement had significantly decreased. He was essentially semi-retired. He was still interested in doing the work he liked such as equipment maintenance but had little interest in managing the business.\nII. The Transactions A. Desire for Change [19] By early 2014, BPL was facing increased price competition. Mr. McAllister believed that the company needed to control its costs. He felt that the Appellant\u2019s heart was no longer in the business and recognized that BPL would have more financial flexibility if it did not have to pay the Appellant a share of the profits.\n[20] In late 2014, Mr. McAllister approached the Appellant about buying her shares. The Appellant was surprised. She had not thought about selling her shares. She told Mr. McAllister that she would think about it.\n[21] In 2008, the Appellant had begun dating the man who would eventually become her husband. He lived in a different town, about 60 to 90 minutes away from BPL. The Appellant moved in with him in 2010 and began what turned into years of very early mornings and long commutes to work. The couple married in 2013.\n[22] Although the Appellant had not thought about selling her shares, on reflection, the idea appealed to her. She enjoyed her work at BPL but not the commute. She and her husband wanted to eventually start a family and she was unsure whether she would be able to balance that against the demands of the business.\nB. Negotiations [23] The Appellant offered to sell her shares to Mr. McAllister for $800,000. Mr. McAllister told her that he had been thinking of offering something closer to $250,000 although he testified that, in his mind, he expected a price of somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000. Eventually, they agreed to have the company valued.\n[24] Both the Appellant and Mr. McAllister sought Wallace Brown\u2019s approval of the buyout (both on a personal level and because he had a right of first refusal). However, Wallace Brown stayed out of the negotiations.\n[25] Ultimately, the Appellant and Mr. McAllister agreed to a price of $600,000. The Appellant accepted this price on the conditions that she receive full payment on closing and that the sale be structured in a manner that allowed her to use her capital gains exemption to shelter her gains.\nC. With What Money? [26] Mr. McAllister did not have the money to buy the Appellant\u2019s shares. He knew that the money would have to be borrowed. He wanted to ensure that the interest on that loan would be deductible.\nD. Professional Advice [27] The Appellant and Mr. McAllister decided that they would use BPL\u2019s lawyer to document the share sale. At their lawyer\u2019s suggestion, they retained an accounting firm to provide tax advice.\n[28] The accounting firm explained that there were different ways to structure the transaction. They recommended a series of transactions that would meet both the Appellant\u2019s and Mr. McAllister\u2019s goals.\nE. Introduction of Corco [29] In December 2014, Mr. McAllister rolled all of his shares in BPL to a newly formed holding company named Corco Holdings Inc. (\u201cCorco\u201d). Mr. McAllister was the sole shareholder of Corco.\n[30] While Corco plays an important part in the tax plan, I find that Mr. McAllister was already in the process of creating a holding company for personal tax purposes and would have created one to hold his shares even if the purchase of the Appellant\u2019s shares had not gone through.\nF. Transactions in Issue [31] The transactions in issue are relatively straight-forward.\n[32] In late February 2015, BPL borrowed $600,000 from a bank. BPL gave the bank a charge over all of its assets. Mr. McAllister and Corco guaranteed the loan and Corco pledged its shares in BPL as security. Wallace Brown did not guarantee the loan.\n[33] In early March, Corco purchased all of the Appellant\u2019s shares. Corco paid for the shares by issuing a $600,000 demand promissory note.\n[34] BPL then redeemed those shares from Corco in exchange for $600,000 and Corco used the money to pay the demand promissory note.\n[35] The Appellant testified that she did not know how Mr. McAllister planned to finance the share purchase. Mr. McAllister testified that he did not talk to the Appellant about the loan. I found the Appellant and Mr. McAllister to both be credible. However, on this point, I think that a more accurate description would be that, when the transactions occurred, the Appellant was aware that there were additional steps that had to be undertaken, that someone was going to have to borrow money and that there was going to be a share redemption but, as none of these things affected her, she did not pay particular attention to the details.\n[36] I should note that Wallace Brown did not testify. Neither party asked me to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so and I have not. As the controlling shareholder of BPL and a party to the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement, Wallace Brown clearly had a significant ability to direct how the transactions occurred. However, I accept the Appellant\u2019s and Mr. McAllister\u2019s testimony that Wallace Brown stayed out of the negotiations and simply did what was required of him to close the transactions. In the absence of any evidence from him, I have not considered his motivations for doing so.\nG. Tax Reporting and Reassessment [37] The Appellant reported a capital gain of $599,960. The redemption of the shares in BPL held by Corco resulted in a deemed dividend. Corco claimed a deduction under section 112 resulting in no tax liability.\n[38] The Minister of National Revenue reassessed the Appellant under section 84.1 to remove the capital gain from her income and replace it with a deemed dividend.\nH. The Future [39] BPL repaid the loan within two or three years.\n[40] The company continued to grow. In 2021, Mr. McAllister bought Wallace Brown\u2019s Class A voting preferred shares and common shares for $1,000,000 leaving him and Corco with 100% of the future growth of the company.[1] Wallace Brown continued to own his Class B preferred freeze shares.\nIII. Application of Section 84.1 A. Tests to Be Met [41] Section 84.1 is an anti-avoidance rule designed to prevent surplus stripping. A number of conditions have to be satisfied for the section to apply. Most of those conditions are not in issue.\n[42] The parties agree that section 84.1 will only apply to the transactions in question if:\n(a)the Appellant and Corco did not deal at arm\u2019s length when Corco purchased the Appellant\u2019s shares; and\n(b) immediately after the sale of the Appellant\u2019s shares, Corco and BPL were connected within the meaning of section 186(4).\n[43] I find that neither of these tests was met.\nB. Appellant and Corco Dealt at Arm\u2019s Length [44] The parties agree that the Appellant and Corco are not related persons within the meaning of subsection 251(2) and therefore that the only way that they could be considered to be non-arm\u2019s length was if they were determined to be factually non-arm\u2019s length in accordance with paragraph 251(1)(c).\n[45] The case law establishes that parties can be found to be non-arm\u2019s length under paragraph 251(1)(c) if the parties act in concert without separate interests.[2] The Respondent submits that the Appellant and Corco met that test. The Respondent says Corco was a facilitator whose sole role was to allow the Appellant to make use of her capital gains deduction. I disagree.\n[46] The Respondent\u2019s theory is based on the mistaken premise that the Appellant wanted out of BPL and Mr. McAllister and Corco agreed to help her to do that in the most tax efficient way possible. That is not at all what happened.\n[47] Mr. McAllister approached the Appellant. He was the one who wanted her out of the company. She had not considered selling her shares.\n[48] The Appellant and Corco engaged in hard bargaining regarding the terms of the sale. The Appellant was willing to sell, but only and the right price and only if she could use her capital gains exemption.\n[49] I find that the transactions were structured in the way they were to benefit Corco. Corco needed a way to finance the purchase. Mr. McAllister had neither the available funds nor the ability to borrow them. He needed BPL to finance the buyout and wanted the interest to be deductible by BPL. Mr. McAllister and Corco personally guaranteed the loan because they, not Wallace Brown, were the ones who stood to benefit from it.\n[50] By contrast, the Appellant did not care how or whether Corco arranged financing, so long as she was paid in full on closing. The Appellant benefited from the fact that she received capital gains treatment but she would also have achieved that result if Mr. McAllister bought her shares. Furthermore, she would have achieved that result whether the purchaser bought her shares with the purchaser\u2019s own money or using borrowed money.\n[51] The transactions were simply a step in Mr. McAllister\u2019s long-term plan to own BPL, a plan that started in 2007 when he approached Wallace Brown about buying shares in BPL, continued in 2015 when changing circumstances gave him the opportunity to remove the Appellant as a shareholder, and moved closer to complete fruition in 2021 when he and Corco became BPL\u2019s only common shareholders.\n[52] The Respondent submits that the Appellant, Corco, Wallace Brown and BPL were ultimately in no different position than they would have been if BPL had borrowed money and used it to redeem the Appellant\u2019s shares. This is not a fair comparison. The Respondent is asking me to compare what actually happened to a set of transactions that never would have happened.\n[53] The parties only ended up in the position that they did because the Appellant, when asked, was willing to sell her shares to Corco. If she had been unwilling, the evidence indicates that no transactions would have occurred. There was no evidence that BPL had any right to redeem or purchase the Appellant\u2019s shares. BPL\u2019s Unanimous Shareholders Agreement did not contain a shotgun clause. Even if the Appellant had resigned her employment with BPL (which she did not intend to do), the Unanimous Shareholders Agreement only provided a mechanism by which Wallace Brown and Mr. McAllister (not BPL) could buy her out.\n[54] The Respondent also argues that Corco did not benefit from the transactions. Again, this argument is based on the false premise that the transactions would otherwise have occurred through a redemption of the Appellant\u2019s shares. Corco clearly benefited from the transactions. It significantly increased its share of BPL\u2019s future growth from 40% to 66.7%, an increase that would not have happened without the sale and that, given what Mr. McAllister paid Wallace Brown for his shares in 2021, appears to have been very lucrative for Corco. In addition, Corco indirectly benefited from the additional cashflow that became available to BPL once it no longer had to pay the Appellant a salary.\n[55] The parties directed me to the following cases: Brouillette v. The Queen,[3] McMullen v. The Queen,[4] Poulin v. The Queen,[5] and RMM Canadian Enterprises Inc. v. The Queen.[6] I find that the Appellant\u2019s circumstances are far more similar to those where section 84.1 was found not to apply (Brouillette, McMullen and Mr. Poulin\u2019s circumstances in Poulin ) than they were to those in RMM where section 212.1 was found to apply or to those of Mr. Turgeon in Poulin where section 84.1 was found to apply.\n[56] Ultimately, for the Appellant and Corco to have been acting in concert without separate interests, there must be something more than sharing the same tax advisors and having a common interest in getting the deal done.[7] Based on the evidence before me, I cannot see what that something more was.\nC. Corco and BPL Were Not Connected [57] Having concluded that the Appellant and Corco dealt at arm\u2019s length, there is no need for me to consider whether Corco and BPL were connected within the meaning of subsection 186(4). I will nonetheless briefly address the issue.\n[58] The parties agree that Corco and BPL were not connected under paragraph 186(4)(b). At first glance, they would appear not to have been connected under paragraph 186(4)(a) either because BPL was not controlled by Corco. However, subsection 186(7) causes subsection 186(2) to apply. Subsection 186(2) would deem BPL to have been controlled by Corco if more than 50% of BPL\u2019s shares having full voting rights belonged to a person with whom Corco did not deal at arm\u2019s length.\n[59] Since, immediately following the sale of the Appellant\u2019s shares, Wallace Brown owned in excess of 90% of BPL\u2019s voting shares, subsection 186(2) could only deem Corco to control BPL if Wallace Brown dealt at non-arm\u2019s length with Corco. Nothing in the evidence would support that conclusion. On the contrary, everything indicates that Wallace Brown at all times dealt at arm\u2019s length with Corco.\nIV. Conclusion [60] Based on all of the foregoing, the reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2015 tax year is vacated.\nV. Alternative Minimum Tax [61] The appeals of the Appellant\u2019s 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years relate to alternative minimum tax carryovers that arose as a result of the Appellant\u2019s capital gain in 2015. The parties agree that the result in the appeals of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 taxation years should be the same as the result in the appeal of the 2015 tax year. Since I have vacated the reassessment of the 2015 tax year, I will accordingly vacate the reassessments of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 16th day of May 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.

The assessment is dated September 7, 2022 and the refusal is dated March 15, 2023.\n[3] The Respondent takes the position that the appeal of the assessment is not properly before the Court and should be quashed because the Appellant failed to file a valid notice of objection within the time limits set out in the Act. The Respondent also takes the position that the Minister\u2019s refusal to accept the T1 adjustment request is a matter of ministerial discretion that is not properly before this Court.\n[4] At the commencement of the hearing, the Appellant took the position that he was only challenging the Minister\u2019s refusal to accept his T1 adjustment and that a notice of objection had indeed been filed within the time limits set out in the Act.\nII - The Relevant Evidence and Chronology\n[5] The Appellant testified on his own behalf. What follows is a chronology of the events based on his testimony and the documentary evidence.\n[6] The Appellant was a career civil servant employed by Public Works and Government Services Canada. He suffered from a long-standing medical condition that caused extreme fatigue and affected his ability to fulfill his employment obligations. He was also unable to file his tax returns going as far back as 2004.\n[7] He eventually filed a request for the Disability Tax Credit (the \u201cDTC\u201d) on August 12, 2014. After some initial enquiries, the Minister issued a notice of determination allowing the Appellant\u2019s claim for the 2014 to 2018 taxation years. The Minister later expanded the Appellant\u2019s eligibility to include the 2005 taxation year onwards.\n[8] By letter dated November 13, 2018, the Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) explained that the Appellant would be entitled to claim the DTC \u201cfor some of those years\u201d but only requests \u201cfor tax years ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year you make the requests can be considered.\u201d Despite this, the Appellant later claimed he had not been informed of the 10-year limit.\n[9] In the meantime, the Minister requested that the Appellant file his income tax returns for the 2011-2014 taxation years. Once the DTC was expanded to include 2005 onwards, he was required to file tax returns for those years as well.\n[10] On September 25, 2018, the Appellant wrote to the CRA requesting an adjustment to the 2008 to 2017 taxation years to incorporate the DTC. However, CRA declined to do so as the Appellant had not filed his tax returns for those years.\n[11] The Appellant was finally able to overcome his difficulties and gather the necessary information to complete his tax returns for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 taxation years. T1 Adjustments were then processed to incorporate the DTC for those years.\n[12] However, the Appellant faced further difficulties in completing his returns for subsequent years. On May 2, 2022, he was finally able to file his income tax return for 2011. He claimed a deduction arising from a RRSP contribution of $25,472.00 as well as a refund of $2,189.53 as a result of the DTC.\n[13] The Minister issued the assessment on September 7, 2022, disallowing all refunds for 2011 because the request was made more than 10 years from the calendar year end. He was told that \u201cwe cannot refund the tax you over-paid.\u201d\n[14] In his oral testimony, the Appellant explained that he intended to claim part of the RRSP deduction for 2011 and the remainder in later years. He now realized that he would lose the benefit of the deduction for 2011. He complained that he had not been informed of the 10-year limit and provided numerous examples of his inability to obtain pension advice or tax information from CRA officials in general.\n[15] In his ongoing discussions with CRA, he was led to believe that a possible solution would be to file a T1 adjustment request for 2011. He followed that advice, filing a T1 adjustment on December 30, 2022 (the \u201cT1 Adjustment Request\u201d). As explained in the Notice of Appeal, he was seeking a \u201csingle line adjustment (\u2026) to reduce or eliminate the RRSP deduction amount erroneously claimed for 2011.\u201d\n[16] The Minister denied the request for an adjustment indicating on March 15, 2023, that the \u201ctaxpayer relief provisions do not apply to requests for reassessments involving permissive deductions\u201d where the taxpayer \u201cis free to choose when, how and how much of a deduction to apply for a particular year.\u201d\n[17] When he made further enquiries with the CRA, the Appellant was told that by attempting to correct the claim for his RRSP contribution in 2011, he was engaging in retroactive tax planning and this was not permitted. He denied this, arguing that he was merely attempting to correct an obvious error or oversight.\n[18] On June 12, 2023, the Appellant filed a notice of objection to the assessment and attached a request for an extension of time. On that date, he also filed a separate notice of objection to the Minister\u2019s refusal to accept his T1 Adjustment request.\n[19] The Minister responded on August 15, 2023, refusing to accept the notice of objection of the assessment on the basis that the Appellant was \u201cobjecting to a statue-barred refund\u201d and it could not be accepted \u201cas a valid objection because the issue is not considered part of the assessment of tax, penalties, and interest.\u201d\n[20] In closing submissions, the Appellant provided a book of authorities and referred to a number of decisions including Canada v. Nassau Walnut Investments Inc, (1997) 2 FC 279 (\u201cNassau\u201d), Weber v. The Queen, 2001 CanLII 478 (TCC) (\u201cWeber\u201d), Watanabe v. The Queen, 1999 CanLII 474 (TCC) (\u201cWatanabe\u201d) and Moulton v. The Queen, 2002 CanLII 798 (TCC) (\u201cMoulton\u201d). All of these decisions dealt with CRA advice and an allegation of retroactive tax planning.\n[21] In Nassau, the Federal Court of Appeal opined that the facts before it did not involve \u201cretroactive tax planning\u201d indicating that \u201cthe case at bar was more analogous to a situation in which a taxpayer seeks to amend his or her tax return for the purposes of taking a deduction to which he or she has some entitlement.\u201d\n[22] The Tax Court relied on Nassau and reached a similar conclusion in Weber.\n[23] In Watanabe, the taxpayer had been led by CRA officials to believe that she was entitled to make contributions to her pension and RRSP and deduct those amounts in a subsequent year. She was later informed that she could not in fact do so and realized the contributions would eventually be fully taxable when withdrawn. This led Justice Bowman to conclude that \u201cher apprehension of double taxation\u201d was well founded. At paragraph 15, he commented as follows:\nIt is obviously beyond my jurisdiction to order the Minister to obtain a remission under the Financial Administration Act. However, I can express the view that this would be a very appropriate case for him to do so. Otherwise, I cannot assist the appellant (\u2026)\n[24] And finally, in Moulton, the taxpayer had similarly relied on the advice of CRA officials before making a contribution to his pension plan on the understanding that it would be deductible in a subsequent year. He was later informed that the amount was not deductible leading Justice Bowman to repeat the observation made in Watanabe about the possibility of obtaining a remission order and concluding that he could not do much more.\n[25] I will address this case-law again below.\nIII \u2013 Filing a Valid Notice of Objection to the Assessment\n[26] I now turn to the issue of the filing of a valid notice of objection to the assessment. Although the Appellant has indicated he was not challenging the Minister\u2019s position, the wording of his notice of appeal appears to suggest otherwise and thus a few comments are in order.\n[27] It is apparent that the notice of objection was not filed within 90 days from the date of the assessment but it was filed during the 12-month period that followed. The Appellant included a request for an extension of time to file the notice of objection.\n[28] When the Minister refused to accept it on August 15, 2023, the Appellant\u2019s remedy was to file an application with the Court requesting an extension of time to file the notice of objection pursuant to subsection 166.2(1) of the Act. The Court would have considered the merits of the application in light of the criteria set out in subsection 166.2(5). The Appellant did not do so and instead filed this appeal.\n[29] The case law has established that the filing of a notice of objection is a condition precedent to the filing of an appeal. This is apparent from a reading of subsection 169(1) that begins with the words \u201cWhere a taxpayer has served notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal (\u2026)\u201d\n[30] The Court does not have the jurisdiction to amend or extend the time-periods established by Parliament, as confirmed in Bormann v. Canada, 2006 FCA 83 (paras. 3-6), and thus the appeal of the assessment must be quashed:\nIV - The T1 Adjustment Request\n[31] I now turn to the Minister\u2019s refusal to accept the T1 Adjustment Request for 2011. The Minister has not specifically addressed the second notice of objection of June 12, 2023 made in connection with the refusal of March 15, 2023.\n[32] The Appellant argues that it was filed within 90 days. Despite this, I find it is not a valid notice of objection because it seeks to address a matter that arises from the exercise of ministerial discretion and is not within the jurisdiction of this Court.\n[33] The Federal Court of Appeal has stated that \u201cthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by statute and in income tax matters, its jurisdiction is generally limited to hearing appeals as to the correctness of assessments (\u2026) it does not extend to judicial review of decisions of the Minister under discretionary relief provisions of the Act\u201d: Bonnybrook Park Industrial Development Co. Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 2018 FCA 136, (para. 19).\n[34] The Appellant\u2019s remedy was not to file an appeal to this Court but to pursue a second administrative review of the Minister\u2019s refusal of March 12, 2023 and, if that fails, to seek judicial review of the decision before the Federal Court.\n[35] In his notice of appeal, the Appellant indicates that he \u201cremains unclear on the status of his Relief Request and requested a Secondary Administrative Review of same (\u2026)\u201d. He was told \u201cthis could take up to 17 months.\u201d It thus appears to be an outstanding request. In any event, it is not something this Court can address.\n[36] Alternatively, or possibly concurrently, as noted by Justice Bowman in Watanabe and Moulton, it might be open to the Appellant to seek a remission order under section 23 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.F 11. This was recently discussed in Dunn v. The Queen, 2022 TCC 44 (paras. 11-12).\n[37] Based on the Appellant\u2019s testimony, it is not apparent to the Court that he was engaging in retroactive tax planning when he made the RRSP contribution in February 2022, expecting it to be deductible for 2011 and possibly in later years. This is not a situation where a taxpayer is seeking to amend a tax return filed more than 10 years before. In this instance, the T1 Adjustment Request was filed within twelve months from the filing of the tax return and RRSP contribution.\nV - Conclusion\n[38] In the end, whether the Court accepts or rejects the Appellant\u2019s complaint that CRA officials did not provide him with proper tax advice or information, this changes nothing to the Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to deal with this appeal.\n[39] For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is hereby quashed\n[40] There shall be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 22 day of May 2024.\n\u201cGuy R.

Background\n[1] On October 1, 2003, Husky Energy Inc. (\u201cHusky\u201d) paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 and a special dividend of $1.00 on each of its common shares outstanding at that time (collectively, the \u201cDividends\u201d).\n[2] Two of Husky\u2019s registered common shareholders at the time the Dividends were paid by Husky were Hutchison Whampoa Europe Investments S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWEI\u201d) and L.F. Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cLFLS\u201d), both of which were resident in Luxembourg. Husky paid each of HWEI and LFLS its proportionate share of the Dividends.\n[3] Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to Hutchison Whampoa Luxembourg Holdings S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWLH\u201d) or to L.F. Management and Investment S.a.r.l. (\u201cLFMI\u201d). Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to a predecessor of HWLH or to a predecessor of LFMI.\n[4] Husky withheld and remitted tax under Part XIII of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d) equal to 5% of the portion of the Dividends paid to HWEI and LFLS. The 5% rate is the lower of the two rates provided under Article 10(2) of the Canada\u2013Luxembourg Income Tax Convention (the \u201cLuxembourg Treaty\u201d).\n[5] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) assessed Husky for tax under Part XIII of the ITA on the portion of the Dividends paid to HWEI and LFLS at the rate of 15% (the \u201cAssessment\u201d). Husky appealed the Assessment.\n[6] Husky\u2019s appeal was heard at the same time as the appeals of HWLH and LFMI on common evidence. I dismissed the appeal of Husky with costs to the Respondent.\n[7] In my judgment, I gave the Respondent and Husky time to settle on costs failing which each party could make submissions on costs within the stipulated time periods. The parties did not settle on costs, and each party provided submissions to the Court.\n[8] The Respondent asks for a lump sum award of $538,351, which the Respondent says is 75% of all legal fees and disbursements incurred by the Respondent.\n[9] Husky submits that the award requested by the Respondent is unreasonable. Husky submits that based on the Respondent\u2019s affidavit in respect of costs affirmed by Jessica Vallati on March 12, 2024 (the \u201cRespondent\u2019s Affidavit\u201d), the award represents 92% of the legal fees incurred by the Respondent plus disbursements for two expert witnesses of $18,012.37.[1]\n[10] Husky submits that a reasonable lump-sum award for costs and disbursements is $271,812.37, comprised of $260,000 for legal fees and $11,812.37 for disbursements. Husky submits that this represents 46% of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees of $520,338.58[2] and one-third of the fee for the expert witness that submitted an expert report to the Court and testified at the hearing of the appeals.[3]\nII. Analysis\n[11] Section 147 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d) addresses costs in General Procedure income tax appeals. It has long been accepted that section 147 affords the Tax Court of Canada discretion in awarding costs.[4] Indeed, fettering this discretion constitutes an error of law.[5]\n[12] The Court\u2019s discretion regarding costs is, however, subject to the requirements that the parties be given an opportunity to make submissions on costs[6] and that the discretion be exercised on a principled, rather than an arbitrary, basis.[7]\n[13] Unless the circumstances dictate otherwise, an award of costs is not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party, nor is an award of costs intended to punish a party.[8]\n[14] A question for the Court in any award of costs is whether the award of costs to the party entitled to costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff, on a reasonable partial indemnity basis or on a full indemnity basis.\n[15] In this case, neither party suggested that the Respondent\u2019s costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff or on a full indemnity basis although the costs requested by the Respondent do approach full indemnification. I agree that neither costs in accordance with the Tariff nor full indemnity-based costs is appropriate in the circumstances. Consequently, the following addresses the determination on a reasonable partial indemnity basis of the costs awarded to the Respondent.\n[16] In Damis Properties Inc. v. R.,[9] I make the following observations regarding this Court\u2019s approach to determining an award of costs:\n. . . I note with respect to these factors that while it is necessary to address whether and why a relevant factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party, the quantum of the award should be determined based on an assessment of all the relevant factors (including, if necessary, factors not listed) viewed collectively. An individual factor may be a positive or negative influence on the decision to award costs to a party and on the quantum of such award. However, attempting to parse the degree of influence of each factor runs counter to the objectives of saving the parties time and money and securing the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of proceedings. [Footnote: Nova Chemicals Corporation v. Dow Chemical Company, 2017 FCA 25 at paragraphs 10 to 13]. Further, as stated by Rothstein JA (as he then was) in Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc. (C.A.), 2002 FCA 417 at paragraph 8:\nAn award of party-party costs is not an exercise in exact science. It is only an estimate of the amount the Court considers appropriate as a contribution towards the successful party\u2019s solicitor-client costs (or, in unusual circumstances, the unsuccessful party\u2019s solicitor-client costs). . . .\nIdentifying whether and why a particular factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party is sufficient to make such a determination based on a collective view of the relevant factors.[10]\n[17] A similar approach is taken by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In Deluca v. R.,[11] Justice Dunphy summarized the object and process of determining costs under the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure as follows:\n. . . I do concur with the plaintiff that the process of assessing costs is not confined to a simple mechanical exercise of counting hours and determining the relevant rate to multiply them by. The criteria listed in Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure make this quite clear. If there is a golden rule in costs it is that the result must be one that appears fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. When s. 131 of the CJA places costs in the discretion of the court, that is what is intended. The criteria in Rule 57.01(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure are something of a checklist to be reviewed in making that overall assessment. The reasonable expectations of the losing party are but one of the criteria to be consulted in searching for that elusive answer, albeit an important one.[12]\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[18] This general approach is also accepted by other Courts and in other contexts. In Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters v. Ontario (Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry,[13] the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada states:\nThe case law is settled that costs awarded on a solicitor and client scale shall be assessed on the basis of quantum meruit: [citations omitted]. A non-exhaustive list of criteria set out in Cohen v. Kealy & Blaney (1985), 26 C.P.C. (2d) 211 (Ont. C.A.), cited with approval by this Court in Bhatnager v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 317, constitutes the framework within which quantum meruit should be gauged: [citations omitted].[14]\n[19] Paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) of the Rules describe a list of specific factors that the Court may consider when exercising its discretion to award costs. Paragraph 147(3)(j) provides that the Court may also consider any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n[20] Although consideration of the specific factors is itself within the discretion of the Court,[15] no doubt addressing the specific factors and any other factors considered relevant by the Court significantly mitigates the risk that an award of costs would be perceived as arbitrary.\n[21] The positions of the Respondent and Husky on the factors listed in paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) are as follows:\n1. Paragraph 147(3)(a) - The Result of the Proceeding\n[22] In Bowker, the Federal Court of Appeal held that in a case where there are only two possible outcomes (i.e., success or failure) this factor could be taken into consideration by the Court only on the issue of a party\u2019s entitlement to costs and not on the issue of the quantum of costs as the inclusion of the latter consideration would amount to double counting.[16]\n[23] In other words, once a party\u2019s entitlement to costs is determined, the role of this factor is to address situations where the party achieves less than 100% success. In such a case, it is for the Tax Court judge to determine the impact of this factor on the award of costs.\n[24] Husky accepts that the Respondent was completely successful. The success of the Respondent warrants an appropriate award of costs to the Respondent as determined by consideration of all other factors relevant to the quantum of costs.\n2. Paragraph 147(3)(b) - The Amounts in Issue\n[25] The amount in issue for Husky was $32,898,696. Husky acknowledges that this amount \u201cseems\u201d large but submits that \u201cit must be contextualized for a particular taxpayer\u201d. In my view, regardless of the context, the amount in issue was substantial and supports an appropriate award of costs to the Respondent.\n3. Paragraph 147(3)(c) - The Importance of the Issues\n[26] The Respondent submits that the decision in these appeals addresses treaty shopping issues that are important to Organisation for Economic Co\u2011operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) member countries such as Canada.\n[27] I accept that reasons for judgment addressing, both generally and in the context of the GAAR, the fundamental elements of the regime in Part XIII of the ITA and the dividend articles of OECD based tax treaties that modify the application of that regime may be of importance to corporations resident in Canada that pay or credit (or are deemed to pay or credit) dividends to non-resident persons, as well as to the non-resident persons to which such dividends are paid. Such reasons for judgment may also be of importance to persons that enter securities lending arrangements in respect of shares issued by corporations resident in Canada.\n[28] Accordingly, I find that this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to the Respondent.\n4. Paragraph 147(3)(d) - Any Offer of Settlement Made in Writing\n[29] The parties agree that there were no settlement offers. Consequently, this factor plays no role in the award of costs.\n5. Paragraph 147(3)(e) - The Volume of Work\n[30] The Respondent submits that the appeal involved a significant amount of work. The Respondent states that three main counsel spent over 1,700 hours on the appeal and that other lawyers and paralegals spent an additional 500 hours.\n[31] Husky accepts that the volume of work was substantial for both parties but submits that where the volume of work is correlated with the complexity of the issues, it is not appropriate to effectively double count the same factor.[17]\n[32] With respect, I do not agree with this proposition. Unless the circumstances suggest otherwise, the volume of work is objectively reflected in the time spent by counsel on the appeal, and this is in turn reflected in the total legal and related costs incurred by a party. Consequently, regardless of the complexity of the matter, a determination of an appropriate contribution to the costs of a party must necessarily consider this factor since it is baked into the total costs incurred by that party.\n[33] Of course, the complexity of an appeal may support or call into question the quantum of time spent on an appeal (i.e., may call into question the volume of work). As well, other related factors, such as the rate(s) charged by counsel and the differences between in-house counsel and private law firm counsel, may also come into play in considering the implications of the volume of work and the Court is free to consider those factors in determining an appropriate award for costs,[18] which I have done.\n[34] In this case, the volume of work resulted in legal costs for the Respondent of $520,338.58[19] and there is nothing I am aware of that calls into question the need for that volume of work, or the costs incurred by the Respondent to conduct that volume of work. Accordingly, I find that this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to the Respondent.\n6. Paragraph 147(3)(f) - The Complexity of the Issues\n[35] The Respondent submit that the issues raised by the appeal were complex \u201cbecause beneficial ownership requires a minute appreciation of the underlying facts\u201d.\n[36] Husky agrees that \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d requires a factual context but states that most of the facts were outside of Husky\u2019s knowledge and that the parties agreed upon a comprehensive partial agreed statement of facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d).\n[37] I agree with the Respondent that the phrase \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d, as used in the Luxembourg Treaty, is not a simple concept to either understand or apply even with the assistance of the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Tax Court of Canada. In particular, as each fact situation is different, the jurisprudence does not diminish the complexities associated with a determination of whether a particular person is the beneficial owner of a dividend in a particular set of circumstances.\n[38] As well, while I commend the parties for the PASF, which was of great assistance to the Court, I accept that developing arguments and analysis which address the application of the concept of beneficial ownership to a particular set of facts is a task fraught with complexity and subtlety.\n[39] Accordingly, I find that this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to the Respondent.\n7. Paragraph 147(3)(g) - The Conduct of any Party that Tended to Shorten or to Lengthen Unnecessarily the Duration of the Proceeding\n[40] Neither party made submissions regarding this factor.\n[41] As already stated, the efforts of counsel for the Respondent and Husky to shorten the proceedings by agreeing to the PASF are commendable but since such efforts benefitted all parties it is not a factor in determining the quantum of costs in this appeal.\n8. Paragraph 147(3)(h) - The Denial or the Neglect or Refusal of any Party to Admit Anything that should have been Admitted\n[42] Neither party made submissions regarding this factor, and I am not aware of anything that suggests that this factor is relevant to determining the quantum of costs in this appeal.\n9. Paragraph 147(3)(i) - Whether any Stage in the Proceedings was Improper, Vexatious, or Unnecessary, or Taken through Negligence, Mistake or Excessive Caution\n[43] The Respondent submits that Husky\u2019s actions required the Respondent to take three unnecessary procedural steps.\n[44] First, Husky did not agree to full documentary disclosure under subsection 82(1) of the Rules and the Respondent was required to bring a successful motion for full documentary disclosure. Second, Husky did not provide a suitable nominee for oral discovery and the Respondent was required to bring a successful motion for another nominee. Third, Husky did not agree to the Respondent\u2019s request to amend its Reply and the Respondent was required to bring a successful motion to amend its Reply.\n[45] Husky submits that none of these motions are relevant to the award of costs to the Respondent as the Respondent was awarded costs on each of the motions and this cost award should not penalize Husky again. Husky goes on to address each of the motions as follows:\n32. With respect to the Rule 82 motion, the Rules require the Crown to convince the Court that a Rule 82 list of documents is warranted. It is not an unnecessary procedural step. In this case, the Crown was successful and obtained an award of costs as set out in Exhibit B to the Crown\u2019s Affidavit. Even the Crown agrees that the time for this motion should be excluded from the legal fees (Crown\u2019s Affidavit at \u00b623).\n33. With respect to the refusal motion, the Crown was successful on the motion and obtained an award of costs of $10,000, as set out in Exhibit D to the Crown\u2019s Affidavit. Thus, the Crown has already been awarded costs for this motion. Even the Crown agrees that the time for this motion should be excluded from the legal fees (Crown\u2019s Affidavit at \u00b623).\n34. With respect to the motion to amend its pleadings, Husky consented to the motion on a no-cost basis. If the Crown was seeking costs for the withdrawal of the motion, it should have done so as part of the consent.[20]\n[46] I agree with Husky that costs in respect of these motions have already been addressed and that the motions play no part in the determination of the costs to be awarded to the Respondent in this appeal. However, to be complete, I will address each of the motions that the Respondent submits were unnecessary.\n[47] The factor in paragraph 147(3)(i) of the Rules addresses (among other things) whether any stage in a proceeding was \u201cimproper, vexatious, or unnecessary\u201d. The word \u201cunnecessary\u201d read in isolation is neutral. However, the word \u201cunnecessary\u201d must be read in context, which necessarily includes the immediately preceding words \u201cimproper, vexatious, or\u201d.\n[48] Read in this context, the word \u201cunnecessary\u201d suggests to me that to be considered in an award of costs in respect of an appeal, the stage in issue must be completely unnecessary and without merit.\n[49] The Respondent submits that its own motions were unnecessary because Husky rejected actions requested by the Respondent or failed to provide a suitable nominee for discovery. The failure of Husky to accede to the Respondent\u2019s requests or to provide a nominee acceptable to the Respondent does not cause the Respondent\u2019s own motions to fall within the ambit of paragraph 147(3)(i) of the Rules.\n[50] Subsection 82(1) of the Rules contemplates that a party may not agree to full documentary discovery and provides a means for the other party to obtain such discovery, which is an application to the Court. The application is necessary if a party wishes full documentary discovery and the other party refuses.\n[51] Subsection 93(2) of the Rules requires a party that is not an individual to select a knowledgeable current or former officer, director, member or employee, to be examined on behalf of that party. If the other party is not satisfied with that person, the examining party may apply to the Court to name some other person. The application is necessary if a party wishes a different person for oral discovery than presented by the opposing party.\n[52] I recognize that in his oral reasons addressing the Respondent\u2019s application under subsection 93(2),[21] my colleague Justice D\u2019Arcy, the case management judge, made it quite clear that he was not impressed with Husky\u2019s behaviour during oral discovery. In the result, Justice D\u2019Arcy required questions to be answered by Husky and appointed a different person for oral discovery. However, Justice D\u2019Arcy also addressed Husky\u2019s behaviour by awarding costs of $10,000 to the Respondent payable forthwith.\n[53] Section 54 of the Rules states that a pleading may be amended by the party filing it at any time either on consent or with the leave of the Court. Husky did not consent to the Respondent amending the Reply and it was necessary for the Respondent to apply to the Court for leave. Husky then consented to the Respondent\u2019s motion prior to the hearing of the motion.\n[54] I accept that it is not uncommon for a party to consent to the filing of an amended pleading by the other party. However, a party is fully entitled to withhold consent if the party does not agree with the proposed amendments to the other party\u2019s pleadings.\n[55] In this case, Husky did not consent to the Respondent amending the Reply and then relented in the face of a motion stating the reasons in support of the amendments. I see nothing in this sequence of events to suggest that the filing of the motion under section 54 of the Rules by the Respondent was an unnecessary stage in the proceeding.\n[56] For the foregoing reasons, none of the three motions were unnecessary but rather were necessary under the Rules for the Respondent to achieve its objectives.\n10. Paragraph 147(3)(i.1) - Whether the Expense Required to have an Expert Witness give Evidence was Justified\n[57] Husky does not dispute the Respondent\u2019s claim for a disbursement of $11,812.37 for the expert witness that tendered an expert report and testified at the hearing of the appeal. Husky did contest the expert report, and I allowed only portions of the report into evidence. However, as Husky does not contest the disbursement on this basis and because the amount of the disbursement is reasonable, I will allow the disbursement of $11,812.37.\n[58] Husky does dispute the disbursement claimed by the Respondent for an expert witness that did not tender an expert report to the Court and did not testify. If a party does not submit an expert report in accordance with section 145 of the Rules, then there is no basis for that party to claim a disbursement for an expert witness. Consequently, I disallow the Respondent\u2019s claim for this disbursement.\n11. Paragraph 147(3)(j) - Any Other Matter Relevant to the Question of Costs\n[59] The Respondent identifies total legal costs of $520,338.58 for 2,224 hours of work, of which \u201cover\u201d 1700 hours was performed by three main counsel.[22] If I divide $520,338.58 by 2,224, this works out to an average hourly rate of $233.97 per hour. I have taken into consideration these figures in determining my award of costs to the Respondent.\n[60] I am not aware of any other factor that requires consideration.\nIII. Conclusion Regarding the Award of Costs\n[61] The factors in favour of an award of costs to the Respondent are the complete success of the Respondent, the material amounts in issue, the importance of the issues, the volume of work and the complexity of the issues. There are no factors suggesting a reduction in the costs that would otherwise be awarded but for those factors.\n[62] Notwithstanding that the Respondent calculates its legal fees based on the higher of two possible rates, the total legal fees incurred by the Respondent of $520,338.58 are relatively modest in comparison to the fees that would be calculated at the rates charged by HWLH\u2019s and LFMI\u2019s counsel.[23] Nevertheless, a reasonable contribution to the costs of the Respondent must be based on the actual legal fees incurred by the Respondent of $520,338.58.\n[63] I am not however convinced that the cost award requested by the Respondent represents a fair and reasonable contribution to the costs of the Respondent taking into consideration the positive factors identified above and the reasonable expectations of any appellant appearing in Tax Court of Canada. Absent considerations that support an award of costs approaching a full indemnity basis,[24] an award of 92% of fees incurred is simply not fair to Husky or reasonable.\n[64] The Respondent cites Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. v. R,[25] as a comparative but the appellant in that case was awarded costs representing approximately 50% of its legal fees plus disbursements.[26] Husky submits that $260,000, or 49.97% of $520,338.58, is reasonable in this case. Husky\u2019s position is in line with the Respondent\u2019s own comparative.[27]\n[65] I have considered the positive factors in the context of the appeal as a whole and the quantum of legal fees claimed by the Respondent and I conclude that a reasonable and fair contribution to the legal fees of the Respondent is the amount of $300,000. The fact that the dollar amount is lower than in Alta Energy reflects the actual cost of counsel in this case as compared to in Alta Energy. The percentage is somewhat higher but that reflects the modest quantum of fees incurred by the Respondent when viewed in the light of the positive factors identified above.\n[66] As previously stated, in addition to the award of $300,000 for legal fees incurred, I will allow the Respondent\u2019s claim for a disbursement of $11,812.37 for the expert witness that submitted an expert report to the Court and testified at the hearing.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 23rd day of May 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

Background [1] On October 1, 2003, Husky Energy Inc. (\u201cHusky\u201d) paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 and a special dividend of $1.00 on each of its common shares outstanding at that time (collectively, the \u201cDividends\u201d).\n[2] Two of Husky\u2019s registered common shareholders at the time the Dividends were paid by Husky were Hutchison Whampoa Europe Investments S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWEI\u201d) and L.F. Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cLFLS\u201d), both of which were resident in Luxembourg. Husky paid each of HWEI and LFLS its proportionate share of the Dividends.\n[3] Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to Hutchison Whampoa Luxembourg Holdings S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWLH\u201d) or to L.F. Management and Investment S.a.r.l. (\u201cLFMI\u201d). Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to a predecessor of HWLH or to a predecessor of LFMI.\n[4] Husky withheld and remitted tax under Part XIII of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d) equal to 5% of the portion of the Dividends paid to HWEI and LFLS, which is the lower of the two rates provided under Article 10(2) of the Canada\u2011Luxembourg Income Tax Convention (the \u201cLuxembourg Treaty\u201d).\n[5] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) assessed HWLH for tax under Part XIII of the ITA on the portion of the Dividends paid to HWEI at the rate of 15% (the \u201cAssessment\u201d). The Assessment was based on the theory that a predecessor of HWLH was the beneficial owner of the Dividends paid by Husky to HWEI or, in the alternative, that Part XIII tax at the rate of 15% was a reasonable tax consequence to HWLH under the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (the \u201cGAAR\u201d). HWLH appealed the Assessment.\n[6] HWLH\u2019s appeal was heard at the same time as the appeals of Husky and LFMI on common evidence. I allowed the appeal of HWLH with costs to HWLH.\n[7] In my judgment, I gave HWLH and the Respondent time to settle on costs failing which each party could make submissions on costs within the stipulated time periods. The parties did not settle on costs, and each party provided submissions to the Court.\n[8] HWLH asks for a lump sum award of $1,086,006.87, representing legal fees in the amount of $785,000 and disbursements in the amount of $301,006.87.\n[9] The Respondent submits that HWLH\u2019s request for costs is unreasonable and that HWLH\u2019s costs award should be limited to $475,610.83, which the Respondent says is 35% of all costs and disbursements that should form the basis of the costs award.\n[10] The Respondent submits that the total fees that should form the basis of the cost award to HWLH are $1,244,420.95 rather than $1,962,054.99 and that the total disbursements for which HWLH should be reimbursed are $40,063.50 rather than $301,006.87. The Respondent describes each of the proposed adjustments to HWLH\u2019s fees and disbursements in a chart titled \u201cHWLH Itemized Summary\u201d attached as an Appendix to the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions, which is reproduced in the Appendix to these reasons.\nII. Analysis A. The Approach to Determining Costs\n[11] Section 147 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d) addresses costs in General Procedure income tax appeals. It has long been accepted that section 147 affords the Tax Court of Canada discretion in awarding costs.[1] Indeed, fettering this discretion constitutes an error of law.[2]\n[12] The Court\u2019s discretion regarding costs is, however, subject to the requirements that the parties be given an opportunity to make submissions on costs[3] and that the discretion be exercised on a principled, rather than an arbitrary, basis.[4]\n[13] Unless the circumstances dictate otherwise, an award of costs is not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party, nor is an award of costs intended to punish a party.[5]\n[14] A question for the Court in any award of costs is whether the award of costs to the party entitled to costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff, on a reasonable partial indemnity basis or on a full indemnity basis.\n[15] In this case, neither party suggested that HWLH\u2019s costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff or on a full indemnity basis. I agree that neither costs in accordance with the Tariff nor full indemnity-based costs is appropriate in the circumstances. Consequently, the following addresses the determination on a reasonable partial indemnity basis of the costs awarded to HWLH.\n[16] In Damis Properties Inc. v. R.,[6] I make the following observations regarding this Court\u2019s approach to determining an award of costs on a reasonable basis:\n. . . I note with respect to these factors that while it is necessary to address whether and why a relevant factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party, the quantum of the award should be determined based on an assessment of all the relevant factors (including, if necessary, factors not listed) viewed collectively. An individual factor may be a positive or negative influence on the decision to award costs to a party and on the quantum of such award. However, attempting to parse the degree of influence of each factor runs counter to the objectives of saving the parties time and money and securing the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of proceedings. [Footnote: Nova Chemicals Corporation v. Dow Chemical Company, 2017 FCA 25 at paragraphs 10 to 13]. Further, as stated by Rothstein JA (as he then was) in Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc. (C.A.), 2002 FCA 417 at paragraph 8:\nAn award of party-party costs is not an exercise in exact science. It is only an estimate of the amount the Court considers appropriate as a contribution towards the successful party\u2019s solicitor-client costs (or, in unusual circumstances, the unsuccessful party\u2019s solicitor-client costs). . . .\nIdentifying whether and why a particular factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party is sufficient to make such a determination based on a collective view of the relevant factors.[7]\n[17] A similar approach is taken by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In Deluca v. R.,[8] Justice Dunphy summarized the object and process of determining costs under the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure as follows:\n. . . I do concur with the plaintiff that the process of assessing costs is not confined to a simple mechanical exercise of counting hours and determining the relevant rate to multiply them by. The criteria listed in Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure make this quite clear. If there is a golden rule in costs it is that the result must be one that appears fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. When s. 131 of the CJA places costs in the discretion of the court, that is what is intended. The criteria in Rule 57.01(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure are something of a checklist to be reviewed in making that overall assessment. The reasonable expectations of the losing party are but one of the criteria to be consulted in searching for that elusive answer, albeit an important one.[9]\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[18] This general approach is also accepted by other Courts and in other contexts. In Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters v Ontario (Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry,[10] the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada states:\nThe case law is settled that costs awarded on a solicitor and client scale shall be assessed on the basis of quantum meruit: [citations omitted]. A non-exhaustive list of criteria set out in Cohen v. Kealy & Blaney (1985), 26 C.P.C. (2d) 211 (Ont. C.A.), cited with approval by this Court in Bhatnager v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 317, constitutes the framework within which quantum meruit should be gauged: [citations omitted].[11]\n[19] Paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) of the Rules describe a list of specific factors that the Court may consider when exercising its discretion to award costs. Paragraph 147(3)(j) provides that the Court may also consider any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n[20] Although consideration of the specific factors is itself within the discretion of the Court,[12] no doubt addressing the specific factors and any other factors considered relevant by the Court significantly mitigates the risk that an award of costs would be perceived as arbitrary.\nB. The Submissions of the Parties\n[21] As noted above, the general tenor of the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions is that HWLH, LFMI and Husky had a common goal and were working in concert and that when all three appeals are considered together the Respondent was successful. In my view, this argument fails to reflect how the ITA works.\n[22] Under the ITA, assessments are made against taxpayers.[13] Assessments of different taxpayers need not be consistent,[14] and assessments of different taxation years of the same taxpayer need not be consistent unless a statutory rule says otherwise.[15] HWLH and LFMI are separate taxpayers regardless of the ownership structure above these corporations. Each of HWLH and LFMI received a separate assessment under the ITA and each is entitled to appeal that assessment to the Tax Court of Canada.[16] In the circumstances, I see no reason to determine costs on the basis proposed by the Respondent.\n[23] I note that the Minister chose the strategy of assessing HWLH and LFMI, two non-resident corporations that were not paid a dividend by Husky, even though Husky, a solvent Canadian resident public company, was assessed as the payor of the Dividends.[17]\n[24] I accept that the facts giving rise to the assessments of Husky, HWLHI and LFMI share a great deal in common. However, HWLH addressed this \u201cduplication\u201d by agreeing to the content of the Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d) and by agreeing with the counsel for Husky and LFMI on a strategy at the hearing of the three appeals that minimized duplication and the consumption of time. It is not at all clear to me what other steps the appellants could have taken to limit legal fees when each needed to address its own multi-million dollar assessment of tax.\n[25] The Respondent submits that \u201c[t]he convocation of nine lawyers for the appellants during the entire three weeks of trial was unnecessary. The costs award should be discounted for this waste.\u201d I will address this point, which relates to consideration of the volume of work and the costs associated with that work, later in these reasons.\n[26] The Respondent submits that LFMI and HWLH pursued an \u201cunnecessarily aggressive trial strategy\u201d and that \u201c[t]he costs award should be reduced because tax benefit and avoidance transactions ought to have been admitted\u201d.[18] The Respondent also states that \u201c[t]he GAAR issues could have been heard with admissions on the tax benefit and avoidance issue questions, which occurs frequently\u201d.[19]\n[27] In a case involving the application of the GAAR, the appellant is entitled to dispute all three elements of the GAAR (i.e., tax benefit, avoidance transaction and abuse). The fact that other appellants have conceded the first two elements is indicative of nothing more than the judgment of the appellant and their counsel in such other cases.\n[28] In Cameco Corporation v. R.,[20] I addressed the argument by Cameco, the successful party, that the Respondent should not have pursued a sham argument as follows:\n. . . the merit of the Respondent's case is not relevant to the Court\u2019s consideration of the result. The rationale for costs is not to punish the losing party based on an ex post facto analysis of the relative merit of the positions taken.[21]\n[29] Similarly, the rationale for costs is not to parse ex post facto the merits of the case put forward by a successful appellant. An appellant is entitled to put all reasonable arguments in favour of the appellant\u2019s position to the Court for determination.\n[30] The position that a party may pursue all reasonable arguments is consistent with the case law addressing pleadings, which limits the striking of pleadings to situations where it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or has no reasonable prospect of success.[22]\n[31] The decision whether or not and how to pursue a particular position at trial is a strategic decision and it is not the role of this Court to second guess counsel\u2019s judgment on such matters in an award of costs. In RMM Canadian Enterprises Inc. v. R.,[23] Judge Bowman (as he then was) observed:\n. . . It frequently happens in litigation that arguments are advanced in support of positions that, with the benefit of hindsight, turn out to have been unnecessary. Unless such arguments are plainly frivolous or untenable, I do not think that a litigant should be penalized in costs simply because its counsel decides to pull out all the stops, nor do I think that it is my place to second guess counsel's judgment, after the event, and say, in effect[:]\u201cIf you had had the prescience to realize how I was going to decide we could have saved a lot of time by confining the case to one issue.\u201d Moreover, one of counsel's responsibilities is to build a record which will enable an appellate court to consider all of the issues.[24]\n[32] HWLH fully explains the reasons for the position taken by HWLH and LFMI on the tax benefit and tax avoidance transaction issues[25] and I discern nothing unreasonable in the approach taken by HWLH in choosing to adopt this strategy.\n[33] The Respondent submits that \u201ca global approach to costs considering the three appeals heard on common evidence would be in the interests of justice.\u201d In my view, justice is served only if each party entitled to costs is awarded costs that are determined in accordance with the principles set out above rather than on a consolidated basis.\n[34] The Respondent was fully entitled to pursue the Minister\u2019s assessment of HWLH under the GAAR notwithstanding (i) the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.,[26] (ii) the Minister was assessing the payor of the Dividends under the provisions in the ITA intended to facilitate the collection of Part XIII tax, and (iii) Husky did not pay a dividend to HWLH or to a predecessor of HWLH. However, the Respondent must accept the reasonable cost consequences of that strategic decision.\n[35] The following addresses the specific factors in paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) of the Rules.\n1. Paragraph 147(3)(a) - The Result of the Proceeding [36] In Bowker, the Federal Court of Appeal held that in a case where there are only two possible outcomes (i.e., success or failure) this factor could be taken into consideration by the Court only on the issue of a party\u2019s entitlement to costs and not on the issue of the quantum of costs.[27]\n[37] In other words, once a party\u2019s entitlement to an award of costs is determined, the role of this factor is to address situations where the party achieves less than 100% success. In such a case, it is for the Tax Court judge to determine the impact of this factor on the award of costs.\n[38] The Respondent accepts that HWLH was successful but submits that this success must be considered in the context of the overall success of the Respondent. The Respondent submits that \u201cthe combined total of the costs awards in the HWLH and LFMI appeals should approximate the Crown\u2019s costs award in the Husky appeal.\u201d\n[39] I disagree with this submission. The success of HWLH warrants an appropriate award of costs to HWLH as determined by consideration of all other factors relevant to the quantum of costs in HWLH\u2019s appeal just as the award of costs to the Respondent in Husky\u2019s appeal was determined by consideration of all other factors relevant to the quantum of costs in that appeal.\n2. Paragraph 147(3)(b) - The Amounts in Issue [40] HWLH says that the total amount in issue for HWLH was $39,987,127.27, of which $24,180,541.50 was Part XIII tax and $15,716,585.77 was interest.[28] The Respondent does not explicitly address the amount in issue.\n[41] In my view, the amount in issue was substantial and, therefore, this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to HWLH.\n3. Paragraph 147(3)(c) - The Importance of the Issues [42] HWLH submits that the issues in HWLH\u2019s appeal were important and novel. HWLH states:\n11. . . . Until the Judgment, no prior decision had considered: (a) subsection 212(2) and the role of the identity of the non-resident recipient of a dividend; (b) the beneficial ownership of dividends in a securities lending arrangement; (c) the object, spirit and purpose of Article X of the Barbados Treaty; (d) the object, spirit and purpose of Article 10(2) of the Luxembourg Treaty; or (e) the application of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. in the treaty context.\n12. The beneficial ownership issue in the Appeal is of broad importance to the Canadian financial markets. The Court noted that securities lending arrangements are not unusual. The Court also cited a 2019 Bank of Canada publication stating that \u201c[s]ecurities lending plays an important role in Canadian financial markets\u201d and is \u201cone of Canada\u2019s core funding markets\u201d.\n13. Given the ubiquity and significance of securities lending arrangements in capital markets in Canada, the Judgment has important withholding tax implications for Canadian dividend payers and withholding agents when payments are made to non-resident shareholders. The beneficial ownership issue is also relevant to the interpretation and application of Articles 11 (interest) and 12 (royalties) of Canada\u2019s tax treaties, which also contain a beneficial ownership requirement.\n14. The Court\u2019s analysis of the GAAR will also have broad ramifications for taxpayers in both the treaty and non-treaty context. The Judgment is one of the first decisions to apply the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Deans Knight. In Deans Knight, the Court clarified that the rationale of a provision may be fully captured by its text, but this must be confirmed by following the approach to statutory interpretation that is applicable to the GAAR. In contrast to the provision at issue in Deans Knight, the Court found that the rationale of Article 10(2) of the Luxembourg Treaty is fully reflected in the explicit requirements of the Article, i.e., residence, beneficial ownership and voting power.[29]\n[43] The Respondent does not explicitly address the importance of the issues.\n[44] I accept that reasons for judgment addressing, both generally and in the context of the GAAR, the fundamental elements of the regime in Part XIII of the ITA and the dividend articles of OECD based tax treaties that modify the application of that regime may be important to corporations resident in Canada that pay or credit (or are deemed to pay or credit) dividends to non-resident persons, as well as to the non-resident persons to which such dividends are paid. Such reasons for judgment may also be of importance to persons that enter securities lending arrangements in respect of shares issued by corporations resident in Canada.\n[45] Accordingly, I find that this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to HWLH.\n4. Paragraph 147(3)(d) - Any Offer of Settlement Made in Writing [46] HWLH states that no settlement offers were exchanged and the Respondent does not suggest otherwise. Consequently, this factor plays no role in the award of costs.\n5. Paragraph 147(3)(e) - The Volume of Work and Paragraph 147(3)(f) \u2013 Complexity of the Issues [47] The Respondent made no explicit submissions on the volume of work and the complexity of the issues although as I note in the discussion of other factors the Respondent does attempt to address the volume of work indirectly through an adjustment to HWLH\u2019s legal fees.\n[48] HWLH addresses the volume of the work and the complexity of the issues in its submission addressing paragraph 147(3)(e) and then adds a short statement about paragraph 147(3)(f). Given this approach, for clarity, I will address these two factors together.\n[49] HWLH submits that the volume of work was high commensurate with the complexity of the issues. HWLH states:\n20. The volume of work was considerable due to the need to address the interpretation and application of beneficial ownership in a securities lending arrangement, Article X of the Barbados Treaty and Article 10(2) of the Luxembourg Treaty, as well as whether the GAAR applied to deny the tax benefit to the Appellant. With respect to the GAAR, the Appellant had to address, among other things, whether the series of transactions resulted in a misuse or abuse of any of the eight provisions that the Respondent alleged had been misused or abused (i.e., subsections 212(2), 215(1) and 215(6) of the Act, subsection 10(6) of the Income Tax Application Rules, Article X of the Barbados Treaty and Articles 1, 4 and 10 of the Luxembourg Treaty).\n21. The volume of work for the Appellant was also high due to:\n(a) Full disclosure of documents by all parties \u2013 the Respondent obtained an order in the Appeal and the Related Appeals for full disclosure of documents under section 82 of the Rules, which required the Appellant to collect and review thousands of documents and produce approximately 1,000 documents. Of the documents produced, only a small number of them that were not already in the possession of the Respondent were referred to in the PASF or used at the hearing.\n(b) Length of discoveries \u2013 the Respondent examined Donald J. Roberts, the Appellant\u2019s discovery nominee, on two separate occasions in Toronto, even though Mr. Roberts lives in Hong Kong. Mr. Roberts was not an employee of the Appellant at the time of the examinations or the hearing and, therefore, was not under the control of the Appellant. As a non-resident of Canada, Mr. Roberts could also not be subpoenaed to testify at trial. Consequently, the Appellant compensated Mr. Roberts for the time he spent reviewing the Appellant\u2019s and the Respondent\u2019s documents and preparing for and acting as a witness at examinations for discovery and at trial. The Appellant also reimbursed Mr. Roberts for his reasonable travel expenses. The volume of work required for Mr. Roberts to review the documents and prepare to give evidence was considerable and compounded by the fact that the relevant transactions took place in 2003.\n(c) Amendments to the Reply \u2013 the Respondent amended its Reply in July 2021 to raise as a new argument that the transactions resulted in a misuse or abuse of Article X of the Barbados Treaty. The Court rejected this argument and held that the role of the Barbados Treaty was solely to reduce Part XIII tax from 25% to 15% prior to the securities lending arrangement. The Court found no basis for concluding that there was an abuse of the Barbados Treaty, regardless of the rationale of Article X.\n(d) Number of witnesses and duration of the Appeal \u2013 The Appeal and the Related Appeals involved a ten-day hearing with each party represented by three lawyers. The parties filed a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (\u201cPASF\u201d), two volumes of documents referred to in the PASF and two volumes of a joint book of documents. The Appellants called six witnesses and the Respondent called two witnesses, including one expert witness. Although the Appeal was heard on common evidence with the Related Appeals, this did not increase the Appellant\u2019s costs or the length of the hearing. To avoid duplication, only one of the Appellants examined each of the eight witnesses. The Appellant examined Mr. Roberts and cross-examined both of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, namely, the Respondent\u2019s proposed expert, Werner Haslehner, and the Respondent\u2019s only fact witness, Bing Zhang. The Appellant also argued the voir dire in respect of the admissibility of the proposed expert report of Mr. Haslehner. In addition, the Appellant was the only one of the Appellants who needed to rely upon evidence from all of the material witnesses at trial, including Neil McGee, Mr. Roberts and W.Y. Fung. Consequently, even if the Appeal had been heard on its own rather than with the Related Appeals, the hearing would not have been materially shorter. All of the foregoing evidence would have been adduced in the Appeal, whether or not the Appeal was heard with the Related Appeals on common evidence. Having the Appeal and the Related Appeals heard together on common evidence resulted in the efficiencies noted above, which resulted in time and cost savings for the Appellant and the Court.\n(e) The Respondent\u2019s expert evidence was not fully admissible \u2013 The Respondent adduced an expert report opining on domestic Luxembourg law, only a small part of which was admitted into evidence because the full report did not satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity. The Appellant had to consider the entire report, assess whether to adduce a responding report, review the foreign legal authorities and laws that were cited by the proposed expert, many of which were in German and for which the Respondent did not provide an English or French translation, prepare a cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s proposed expert and prepare written and oral submissions on the admissibility of the expert report, all of which significantly increased the Appellant\u2019s costs.\n(f) Confusing legal position with respect to beneficial ownership \u2013 At the time the Assessment was issued, the Minister concluded that HWEI was the beneficial owner of the Dividend and, consequently, the GAAR was the sole basis for the Assessment. In its Reply, the Respondent raised for the first time in support of the Assessment the argument that UF Barbados was the beneficial owner of the Dividend, such that the applicable rate of withholding tax was 15% pursuant to Article X of the Barbados Treaty. The Court found that by adopting the position that UF Barbados was the beneficial owner of the Dividend, the Respondent \u201csignificantly confuse[d] the issue\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily lengthene[d] and complicate[d] the analysis\u201d.\n. . .\n25. The issues in the Appeal were complex given that the Appeal was the first judicial consideration of beneficial ownership in a securities lending arrangement, Article X of the Barbados Treaty and Article 10(2) of the Luxembourg Treaty, and the first application of the principles from Alta Energy in the treaty context.[30]\n[50] I accept that the volume of work required for HWLH\u2019s appeal was substantial and that the complexity of the issues involved fully supports this conclusion.\n[51] I note that the volume of work was increased by certain choices made by the Respondent such as the choice to seek full discovery of documents and the choice to amend the Reply following discovery. The Respondent was fully entitled to make these choices.\n[52] The Bill of Costs attached as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to HWLH\u2019s Affidavit indicates that HWLH\u2019s counsel spent 2319.4 hours on the appeal and accumulated total legal fees of $1,962,054.99. This corresponds to an average hourly rate of $846.\n[53] The Respondent takes issue with the quantum of the legal fees and submits that a cost award should be based on total legal fees of $1,244,420.95. As stated in paragraph 10 of these reasons, the quantum of each adjustment proposed by the Respondent and the reason for each such adjustment are stated in the Appendix to the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions, which is reproduced in the Appendix to these reasons. I will address the Respondent\u2019s position on the quantum of the fees under my review of other relevant factors.\n[54] In conclusion, the volume of work and the complexity of the issues both support an appropriate award of costs to HWLH.\n6. Paragraph 147(3)(g) - The Conduct of any Party that Tended to Shorten or to Lengthen Unnecessarily the Duration of the Proceeding [55] HWLH submits that the Respondent\u2019s decision to pursue the Minister\u2019s application of the GAAR to HWLH in the face of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Alta Energy SCC warrants a finding that this factor is in favour of costs to HWLH.\n[56] I disagree. This factor is not intended to penalize the Respondent for a decision to pursue an assessing position of the Minister. Nor is it intended to penalize an appellant for deciding to appeal an assessment.\n[57] The application of the decision in Alta Energy SCC to HWLH\u2019s facts involved questions of law, questions of mixed law and fact and questions of fact. The Respondent was fully entitled to have these questions decided by the Tax Court of Canada.\n[58] The efforts of counsel for HWLH and counsel for the Respondent to shorten the proceedings by agreeing to the PASF are commendable but since such efforts benefitted all parties, it is not a factor in the awarding of costs in this appeal.\n7. Paragraph 147(3)(h) - The Denial or the Neglect or Refusal of any Party to Admit Anything that should have been Admitted [59] Neither party made submissions regarding this factor, and I am not aware of anything that suggests that this factor is relevant to an award of costs to HWLH.\n8. Paragraph 147(3)(i) - Whether any Stage in the Proceedings was Improper, Vexatious, or Unnecessary, or Taken through Negligence, Mistake or Excessive Caution [60] Neither party made submissions regarding this factor, and I am not aware of anything that suggests that this factor is relevant to an award of costs to HWLH.\n9. Paragraph 147(3)(i.1) - Whether the Expense Required to have an Expert Witness give Evidence was Justified [61] Neither party made submissions regarding this factor, and I am not aware of anything that suggests that this factor is relevant to an award of costs to HWLH.[31]\nParagraph 147(3)(j) - Any Other Matter Relevant to the Question of Costs\n[62] The Respondent challenges the legal fees incurred by HWLH and the disbursements claimed by HWLH.\n[63] With respect to the legal fees, the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions provide reasons for the adjustments stated in the chart in the Appendix to those submissions that addresses legal fees (the \u201cfee chart\u201d). These reasons may be summarized as follows:\nThe GAAR issues could have been heard with admissions on the tax benefit and avoidance issue questions.[32] The fee chart identifies a total reduction of $571,057.98 that falls under this category. The description in the fee chart of the three amounts that comprise this total are as follows:\ni.HWLH legal fee for consideration, preparation and negotiation of PASF and Joint Book; etc. Reduction of 50% because of duplication with LFMI: $88,950.17;\nHWLH legal fee for preparation for trial; Consideration of evidentiary issues; etc. Reduction of 50% because of duplication with LFMI: $292,523.91; and\nHWLH legal fee forattendance at trial including additional preparation during trial reduction by 50%. Three counsel total for both HWLH and LFMI: $189,583.90\nHWLH\u2019s unnecessary voir dire of the Respondent\u2019s expert witness. The fee chart identifies a total reduction of $30,580.51 that falls under this category.\nThe inclusion of fees for the preparation of HWLH\u2019s costs submissions. The fee chart identifies a total reduction of $32,547.56 that falls under this category.\nThe inclusion of fees for David Weekes who the Respondent says acted for Husky. The fee chart identifies a total reduction of $83,448 that falls under this category.\n[64] I note that two of the three fee amounts identified for David Weekes ($38,190 and $24,282) are not reflected in the Cost award column of the fee chart and that even when these amounts are deducted the total of the numbers in the \u201cCost award\u201d column is $1,249,420.95 rather than the total stated in that column of $1,244,420.95.\n[65] With respect to the first category of adjustments totalling $571,057.98, I do not accept the proposition that there was duplication because LFMI faced the same issues as HWLH. HWLH, LFMI and Husky were each fully entitled to the benefit of their own counsel and the hearing of the three appeals was conducted in a manner that, to the greatest extent practicable, avoided duplication of counsel\u2019s efforts.[33]\n[66] As for the time spent by counsel for HWLH, I observed the following in CIT Group Securities (Canada) Inc. v. R.:[34]\n16. The Respondent suggests that the Appellant\u2019s counsel may have significantly over-prepared his presentation. In my view, that is somewhat difficult to gauge in circumstances involving complex legal and factual issues that have not before been the subject of consideration by the Tax Court of Canada. Certainly, in the absence of obvious excess, it is not the role of the Court to second-guess counsel\u2019s judgment regarding the work required to fully prepare for such a case. However, I accept that in circumstances involving such significant stakes for the Appellant, efficiency and frugality may have taken a back seat to thoroughness.\n17 In any event, it is important to recognize that the volume of work is merely one factor that may be considered in assessing whether and to what extent costs should be awarded to a party. The consideration of this factor must not be confused with the ultimate determination of the amount of costs, if any, that are awarded to a party. That determination is to be made on a principled basis, having regard to all relevant factors, which, in addition to the factors identified in subsection 147(3) of the Rules, include any other matter relevant to the question of costs.[35]\n[67] In the second category, the Respondent asks that I remove a portion of HWLH\u2019s legal fees associated with the voir dire of the expert witness because it was inappropriate to challenge the admission of the expert evidence.\n[68] In my view, the Respondent misapprehends the purpose of a voir dire regarding the admission of expert evidence. Such a voir dire is required so that the Tax Court judge may determine that the expert evidence satisfies the criteria for such evidence stipulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Mohan[36] and White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.[37].\n[69] In this case, I conducted a voir dire following which I admitted only a portion of the expert\u2019s report into evidence. Since counsel was successful in arguing for the exclusion of a significant portion of the expert report, I fail to see a reason for reducing HWLH\u2019s legal fees for the purpose of determining the quantum of the award for costs.\n[70] I accept that counsel for HWLH was somewhat overzealous in the pursuit of a bias argument. However, that argument was open to counsel and the pursuit of that argument did not materially add to the time taken for the voir dire. I note that as soon as counsel overstepped the reasonable bounds of questioning in support of that argument, I put an immediate stop to counsel\u2019s questioning. I also put an immediate stop to an attempt by counsel to revisit the issue after my ruling.\n[71] In the third category, the Respondent asks that I remove the legal fees of HWLH incurred for its submissions on costs, which total $32,547.56. I agree with the Respondent that such fees should not factor into this determination of the award for costs but rather should be determined in accordance with the Tariff and I will remove them from the total legal fees of HWLH for the purpose of my determination of the cost award. However, I leave it open to HWLH to make a separate claim for these fees in accordance with the Tariff.\n[72] The fourth category addresses fees for time spent on HWLH\u2019s appeal by David Weekes. I agree with the Respondent that David Weekes advised Husky regarding the securities lending arrangements as his opinion to Husky was admitted in evidence at the hearing. However, that does not preclude Mr. Weekes from providing advice to HWLH in respect of this appeal, which took place 15 to 20 years after he issued his opinion to Husky. Presumably, if there was still a conflict after all that time, Mr. Weekes would have obtained Husky\u2019s consent to act for HWLH. I therefore decline to deduct the fees attributed to Mr. Weekes.\n[73] I am not aware of any other factor that requires consideration.\nIII. The Disbursements Challenged by the Respondent\n[74] The Respondent challenges certain disbursements of HWLH With the exception of the disbursements associated with Mr. Roberts, a witness called by HWLH, I will remit the disbursements claimed by HWLH for taxation.\n[75] As for the disbursements associated with Mr. Roberts, which are itemized in the chart addressing disbursements included in the Appendix to the Respondent\u2019s costs submissions[38], it was HWLH\u2019s choice to put Mr. Roberts forward as HWLH\u2019s nominee for discovery and as a witness at the hearing of the appeal notwithstanding he was no longer employed by a corporation related to the predecessor of HWLH. In the circumstances, I fail to see why the Respondent should compensate HWLH for these costs and I therefore disallow these disbursements.\nIV. Conclusion Regarding the Award of Costs [76] The factors in favour of an award of costs to HWLH are the success of HWLH, the importance of the issues, the material amounts in issue, the volume of work and the complexity of the issues. There are no factors suggesting a reduction in the costs that would otherwise be awarded but for those factors. I note that the success of the Respondent in Husky\u2019s appeal has no bearing on the determination of the award of costs to HWLH.\n[77] The total legal fees incurred by HWLH after the deduction of the $32,547.56 of legal fees for preparing HWLH\u2019s costs submissions are $1,929,507.43. I therefore conclude that a reasonable contribution to the costs of the Respondent should be based on the total legal fees incurred by HWLH of $1,929,507.43.\n[78] I have considered the positive factors in the context of the appeal as a whole and the quantum of legal fees claimed by HWLH and conclude that a reasonable and fair contribution to the legal fees of HWLH is the amount of $700,000. The amount of the disbursements allowed will be determined by the taxing officer subject to the exclusion of all disbursements relating to Mr. Roberts.\nThis Amended Reasons for Order is issued in substitution of the Reasons for Order dated May 23, 2024 to correct a typographical error contained in paragraph 76 of the original Reasons for Order.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 31st day of May 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

MANAGEMENT\nAND INVESTMENT S.A.R.L,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nAMENDED REASONS FOR ORDER\nOwen J.\nI. Background [1] On October 1, 2003, Husky Energy Inc. (\u201cHusky\u201d) paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 and a special dividend of $1.00 on each of its common shares outstanding at that time (collectively, the \u201cDividends\u201d).\n[2] Two of Husky\u2019s registered common shareholders at the time the Dividends were paid by Husky were Hutchison Whampoa Europe Investments S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWEI\u201d) and L.F. Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cLFLS\u201d), both of which were resident in Luxembourg. Husky paid each of HWEI and LFLS its proportionate share of the Dividends.\n[3] Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to Hutchison Whampoa Luxembourg Holdings S.\u00e0.r.l. (\u201cHWLH\u201d) or to L.F. Management and Investment S.a.r.l. (\u201cLFMI\u201d). Husky did not pay any portion of the Dividends to a predecessor of HWLH or to a predecessor of LFMI.\n[4] Husky withheld and remitted tax under Part XIII of the Income Tax Act (the \u201cITA\u201d) equal to 5% of the portion of the Dividends paid to HWEI and LFLS. The 5% rate is the lower of the two rates provided under Article 10(2) of the Canada\u2013Luxembourg Income Tax Convention (the \u201cLuxembourg Treaty\u201d).\n[5] The Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) assessed LFMI for tax under Part XIII of the ITA on the portion of the Dividends paid to LFLS at the rate of 15% (the \u201cAssessment\u201d) on the theory that a predecessor of LFMI was the beneficial owner of the Dividends paid by Husky to LFLS. LFMI appealed the Assessment.\n[6] LFMI\u2019s appeal was heard at the same time as the appeals of Husky and HWLH on common evidence. I allowed the appeal of LFMI with costs to LFMI.\n[7] In my judgment, I gave LFMI and the Respondent time to settle on costs failing which each party could make submissions on costs within the stipulated time periods. The parties did not settle on costs, and each party provided submissions to the Court.\n[8] LFMI asks for a lump sum award of $946,098, which is 50% of the legal fees of $1,573,407 plus disbursements of $159,394.53.[1]\n[9] The Respondent\u2019s cost submissions in this appeal and in the appeal of HWLH are very similar. The Respondent\u2019s general position on costs for LFMI is summarized in the following excerpt:\n14. Given their interrelated nature, common goal, and shared approach, the appellants ought to have worked together and mitigated their costs. Instead the appellants each chose to have different counsel, which LFMI says made the appeals \u201cmore complex and time-consuming.\u201d The Crown should not subsidize this waste. Parties that are prepared to \u201cgo to the wall\u201d must expect to absorb much of their significant costs. It would be unreasonable to award trial-attendance costs for three lawyers from both HWLH and LFMI.\n15. Considering that the parties shared the same advisors prior to the litigation, it would have been more efficient to continue this practice and share the same counsel for the hearing of the appeals. The only logical conclusion for the appellants selecting seperate [sic] counsel was to appear before the Court as independent parties not sharing the same interests. While the appellants have this right, they should expect to absorb much of this expense. From a costs perspective, a total of three trial counsel for HWLH and LFMI (instead of six) is reasonable.[2]\n[10] The Respondent submits that LFMI\u2019s request for costs is unreasonable. The Respondent submits that LFMI\u2019s costs award should be limited to $145,200 for legal fees. The Respondent says that $145,200 is four times the amount stated in LFMI\u2019s bill of costs computed in accordance with Schedule II, Tariff B (the \u201cTariff\u201d) of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure) (the \u201cRules\u201d)[3] for a class C proceeding and approximates 10% of LFMI\u2019s bill of costs computed on a full indemnity basis.\n[11] The Respondent submits that LMFI\u2019s disbursements should be limited to $35,355. The Respondent describes each of its proposed adjustments to LFMI\u2019s disbursements in the chart attached as an Appendix to the Respondent\u2019s cost submissions titled \u201cLFMI Itemized Summary\u201d, which is reproduced in the Appendix to these reasons.\nII. Analysis A. The Approach to Determining Costs [12] Section 147 of the Rules addresses costs in General Procedure income tax appeals. It has long been accepted that section 147 affords the Tax Court of Canada discretion in awarding costs.[4] Indeed, fettering this discretion constitutes an error of law.[5]\n[13] The Court\u2019s discretion regarding costs is, however, subject to the requirements that the parties be given an opportunity to make submissions on costs[6] and that the discretion be exercised on a principled, rather than an arbitrary, basis.[7]\n[14] Unless the circumstances dictate otherwise, an award of costs is not intended to fully compensate the actual costs incurred by a party, nor is an award of costs intended to punish a party.[8]\n[15] A question for the Court in any award of costs is whether the award of costs to the party entitled to costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff, on a reasonable partial indemnity basis or on a full indemnity basis.\n[16] In this case, neither party suggested that LFMI\u2019s costs should be determined in accordance with the Tariff or on a full indemnity basis. I agree that neither costs in accordance with the Tariff[9] nor full indemnity-based costs is appropriate in the circumstances. Consequently, the following addresses the determination on a reasonable partial indemnity basis of the costs awarded to LFMI.\n[17] In Damis Properties Inc. v. R.,[10] I make the following observations regarding this Court\u2019s approach to determining an award of costs on a reasonable basis:\n. . . I note with respect to these factors that while it is necessary to address whether and why a relevant factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party, the quantum of the award should be determined based on an assessment of all the relevant factors (including, if necessary, factors not listed) viewed collectively. An individual factor may be a positive or negative influence on the decision to award costs to a party and on the quantum of such award. However, attempting to parse the degree of influence of each factor runs counter to the objectives of saving the parties time and money and securing the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of proceedings. [Footnote: Nova Chemicals Corporation v. Dow Chemical Company, 2017 FCA 25 at paragraphs 10 to 13]. Further, as stated by Rothstein JA (as he then was) in Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc. (C.A.), 2002 FCA 417 at paragraph 8:\nAn award of party-party costs is not an exercise in exact science. It is only an estimate of the amount the Court considers appropriate as a contribution towards the successful party\u2019s solicitor-client costs (or, in unusual circumstances, the unsuccessful party's solicitor-client costs). . . .\nIdentifying whether and why a particular factor supports or does not support an award of costs to a particular party is sufficient to make such a determination based on a collective view of the relevant factors.[11]\n[18] A similar approach is taken by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In Deluca v. R.,[12] Justice Dunphy summarized the object and process of determining costs under the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure as follows:\nI do concur with the plaintiff that the process of assessing costs is not confined to a simple mechanical exercise of counting hours and determining the relevant rate to multiply them by. The criteria listed in Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure make this quite clear. If there is a golden rule in costs it is that the result must be one that appears fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. When s. 131 of the CJA places costs in the discretion of the court, that is what is intended. The criteria in Rule 57.01(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure are something of a checklist to be reviewed in making that overall assessment. The reasonable expectations of the losing party are but one of the criteria to be consulted in searching for that elusive answer, albeit an important one.[13]\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[19] This general approach is also accepted by other Courts and in other contexts. In Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters v. Ontario (Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry,[14] the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada states:\nThe case law is settled that costs awarded on a solicitor and client scale shall be assessed on the basis of quantum meruit: [citations omitted]. A non-exhaustive list of criteria set out in Cohen v. Kealy & Blaney (1985), 26 C.P.C. (2d) 211 (Ont. C.A.), cited with approval by this Court in Bhatnager v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 317, constitutes the framework within which quantum meruit should be gauged: [citations omitted.].[15]\n[20] Paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) of the Rules describe a list of specific factors that the Court may consider when exercising its discretion to award costs. Paragraph 147(3)(j) provides that the Court may also consider any other matter relevant to the question of costs.\n[21] Although consideration of the specific factors is itself within the discretion of the Court,[16] no doubt addressing the specific factors and any other factors considered relevant by the Court significantly mitigates the risk that an award of costs would be perceived as arbitrary.\nB. The Submissions of the Parties\n[22] As noted above, the general tenor of the Respondent\u2019s cost submissions is that LFMI, HWLH and Husky had a common goal and were working in concert and that when all three appeals are considered together the Respondent was successful. In my view, this argument fails to reflect how the ITA works.\n[23] Under the ITA, assessments are made against taxpayers.[17] Assessments of different taxpayers need not be consistent,[18] and assessments of different taxation years of the same taxpayer need not be consistent unless a statutory rule says otherwise.[19] LFMI and HWLH are separate taxpayers regardless of the ownership structure above these corporations. Each of LFMI and HWLH received a separate assessment under the ITA and each is entitled to appeal that assessment to the Tax Court of Canada.[20] In the circumstances, I see no reason to determine costs on the basis proposed by the Respondent.\n[24] I note that the Minister chose the strategy of assessing LFMI and HWLH, two non-resident corporations that were not paid a dividend by Husky, even though Husky, a solvent Canadian resident public company, was assessed as the payor of the Dividends.[21]\n[25] I accept that the facts giving rise to the assessments of Husky, HWLH and LFMI share a great deal in common. However, LFMI addressed this \u201cduplication\u201d by agreeing to the content of the PASF and by agreeing with the counsel for Husky and HWLH on a strategy at the hearing of the three appeals that minimized duplication and the consumption of time. It is not at all clear to me what other steps the appellants could have taken to limit legal fees when each needed to address its own multi\u2011million dollar assessment of tax.\n[26] The Respondent submits that \u201c[t]he convocation of nine lawyers for the appellants during the entire three weeks of trial was unnecessary. The costs award should be discounted for this waste.\u201d I will address this point, which relates to consideration of the volume of work and the costs associated with that work, later in these reasons.\n[27] The Respondent submits that LFMI and HWLH pursued an \u201cunnecessarily aggressive trial strategy\u201d and that \u201c[t]he costs award should be reduced because tax benefit and avoidance transactions ought to have been admitted\u201d.[22] The Respondent also states that \u201c[t]he GAAR issues could have been heard with admissions on the tax benefit and avoidance issue questions, which occurs frequently\u201d.[23]\n[28] In a case involving the application of the GAAR, the appellant is entitled to dispute all three elements of the GAAR (i.e., tax benefit, avoidance transaction and abuse). The fact that other appellants have conceded the first two elements is indicative of nothing more than the judgment of the appellant and their counsel in such other cases.\n[29] In Cameco Corporation v. R.,[24] I addressed the argument by Cameco, the successful party, that the Respondent should not have pursued a sham argument as follows:\n\u2026 the merit of the Respondent\u2019s case is not relevant to the Court\u2019s consideration of the result. The rationale for costs is not to punish the losing party based on an ex post facto analysis of the relative merit of the positions taken.[25]\n[30] Similarly, the rationale for costs is not to parse ex post facto the merits of the case put forward by a successful appellant. An appellant is entitled to put all reasonable arguments in favour of the appellant\u2019s position to the Court for determination.\n[31] The position that a party may pursue all reasonable arguments is consistent with the case law addressing pleadings, which limits the striking of pleadings to situations where it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or has no reasonable prospect of success.[26]\n[32] The decision whether or not and how to pursue a particular position at trial is a strategic decision and it is not the role of this Court to second guess counsel\u2019s judgment on such matters in an award of costs. In RMM Canadian Enterprises Inc. v. R.,[27] Judge Bowman (as he then was) observed:\n. . . It frequently happens in litigation that arguments are advanced in support of positions that, with the benefit of hindsight, turn out to have been unnecessary. Unless such arguments are plainly frivolous or untenable, I do not think that a litigant should be penalized in costs simply because its counsel decides to pull out all the stops, nor do I think that it is my place to second guess counsel's judgment, after the event, and say, in effect[:]\u201cIf you had had the prescience to realize how I was going to decide we could have saved a lot of time by confining the case to one issue.\u201d Moreover, one of counsel's responsibilities is to build a record which will enable an appellate court to consider all of the issues.[28]\n[33] HWLH fully explains the reasons for the position taken by LFMI and HWLH on the tax benefit and tax avoidance transaction issues[29] and I discern nothing unreasonable in the approach taken by LFMI in choosing to adopt this strategy.\n[34] The Respondent submits that \u201ca global approach to costs considering the three appeals heard on common evidence would be in the interests of justice.\u201d In my view, justice is served only if each party entitled to costs is awarded costs that are determined in accordance with the principles set out above rather than on a consolidated basis.\n[35] The Respondent was fully entitled to pursue the Minister\u2019s assessment of LFMI under the GAAR notwithstanding (i) the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L.,[30] (ii) the Minister was assessing the payor of the Dividends under the provisions in the ITA intended to facilitate the collection of Part XIII tax, and (iii) Husky did not pay a dividend to LFMI or to a predecessor of LFMI. However, the Respondent must accept the reasonable cost consequences of that strategic decision.\n[36] The following addresses the specific factors in paragraphs 147(3)(a) to (i.1) of the Rules.\n1. Paragraph 147(3)(a) - The Result of the Proceeding [37] In Bowker, the Federal Court of Appeal held that in a case where there are only two possible outcomes (i.e., success or failure) this factor could be taken into consideration by the Court only on the issue of a party\u2019s entitlement to costs and not on the issue of the quantum of costs as the inclusion of the latter consideration would amount to double counting.[31]\n[38] In other words, once a party\u2019s entitlement to costs is determined, the role of this factor is to address situations where the party achieves less than 100% success. In such a case, it is for the Tax Court judge to determine the impact of this factor on the award of costs.\n[39] The Respondent accepts that LFMI was successful but submits that this success must be considered in the context of the overall success of the Respondent. The Respondent submits that \u201cthe combined total of the costs awards in the HWLH and LFMI appeals should approximate the Crown\u2019s costs award in the Husky appeal.\u201d[32]\n[40] I disagree with this submission. The success of LFMI warrants an appropriate award of costs to LFMI as determined by consideration of all other factors relevant to the quantum of costs in LFMI\u2019s appeal just as the award of costs to the Respondent in Husky\u2019s appeal was determined by consideration of all other factors relevant to the quantum of costs in that appeal.\n2. Paragraph 147(3)(b) - The Amounts in Issue [41] LFMI says that the total amount in issue for LFMI was more than $25,000,000 and that the amount favours an enhanced award.[33] The Respondent does not explicitly address the amount in issue.\n[42] In my view, the amount in issue for LFMI was substantial and, therefore, this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to LFMI.\n3. Paragraph 147(3)(c) - The Importance of the Issues [43] LFMI submits that this factor supports its claim for costs. LFMI states:\n20. The appeal raised novel questions about the interpretation and application of Article X(2) of the Canada\u2013Barbados Income Tax Convention (the \u201cBarbados Treaty\u201d) and Article 10(2) of the Canada\u2013Luxembourg Income Tax Convention (the \u201cLuxembourg Treaty\u201d), specifically in the context of share\u2011lending arrangements.\n21. While the concept of \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d had been considered by the Tax Court and Federal Court of Appeal in the prior decisions of Pr\u00e9vost Car Inc. v. R. and Velcro Canada Inc. v. R., those cases involved different (albeit similar) treaty provisions between different treaty partners and entirely different factual matrixes.\n22. The issue of the application of the GAAR to the facts also raised novel questions about the object, spirit and purpose of Article X(2) of the Barbados Treaty and Article 10(2) of the Luxembourg Treaty and the application of the GAAR to share lending arrangements.[34]\n[44] The Respondent did not explicitly address the importance of the issues.\n[45] I accept that reasons for judgment addressing, both generally and in the context of the GAAR, the fundamental elements of the regime in Part XIII of the ITA and the dividend articles of OECD based tax treaties that modify the application of that regime may be important to corporations resident in Canada that pay or credit (or are deemed to pay or credit) dividends to non-resident persons, as well as to the non-resident persons to which such dividends are paid. Such reasons for judgment may also be of importance to persons that enter securities lending arrangements in respect of shares issued by corporations resident in Canada.\n[46] Accordingly, I find that this factor supports an appropriate award of costs to LFMI.\n4. Paragraph 147(3)(d) - Any Offer of Settlement Made in Writing [47] The parties agree that there were no settlement offers. Consequently, this factor plays no role in the award of costs.\n5. Paragraph 147(3)(e) - The Volume of Work and Paragraph 147(3)(f) \u2013 Complexity of the Issues [48] The Respondent made no explicit submissions on the volume of work and the complexity of the issues although as I note in the discussion of other factors the Respondent does attempt to address the volume of work indirectly through an adjustment to LFMI\u2019s legal fees.\n[49] As with my reasons addressing HWLH\u2019s costs, I have addressed these two factors together. In this case, it is because LFMI submits that the issues were complex and that this in turn leads to a greater volume of work. LFMI states:\n23. In Alta Energy, the Tax Court held that the application of a particular treaty provision and whether an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d gave rise to an \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201cmisuse\u201d of the Act and the Luxemborug [sic] Treaty are complex issues that support an increased award of costs.\n24. LFMI\u2019s appeal involved the application of the Act, the Barbados Treaty, the Luxembourg Treaty and the GAAR, which are complex issues that favour an enhanced award.\n25. An analysis of the issues in LFMI\u2019s appeal was also complicated by the Minister\u2019s choice to assess an entity that did not receive the dividend that was the subject of the assessment. [\u2026]\n26. Where an appeal involves complex issues, this generally signifies that the facts are more complicated and that the documents and evidence to be reviewed are lengthy, resulting in lengthy examinations and preparation for trial. The Tax Court has also recognized that this means counsel must also work hard at distilling complex facts in such a way as to facilitate the Court\u2019s appreciation of the matter, and that where parties spend a substantial amount of time preparing a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts and affixed agreed documents, enhanced costs may be awarded.\n27. LFMI\u2019s appeal was heard on common evidence with two other appellants (HWLH and Husky) over a three-week period. The logistics of the trial, including the drafting of a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts with affixed agreed documents and agreeing to the order of witnesses and oral argument, were made more complex and time-consuming by the involvement of three sets of appellant counsel. The appellants expended additional resources to promote the efficient use of judicial resources and to provide further assistance to the Court to address complex issues that affected multiple parties. This further justifies the payment of the actual fees incurred by LFMI.\n28. LFMI\u2019s appeal was made more complex and costly by the Respondent\u2019s insistence on full disclosure under section 82 of the Tax Court Rules. Additional time was required in the circumstances, as the full disclosure procedure required a detailed review of documents and communications that were prepared in 2003, which was over 15 years before the list of documents was served on December 19, 2018. The Tax Court has recognized that the preparation of a full disclosure list of documents requires a substantial amount of work from the appellant in relation to document review and examinations for discovery, and therefore, favours an appropriate cost award.\n29. Furthermore, LFMI spent additional time on the admissibility and substance of the Respondent\u2019s expert evidence, which ultimately did not factor into the final determination of LFMI\u2019s appeal (nor the appeals of HWLH and Husky). This additional time supports an enhanced cost award.[35]\n[50] I accept that the volume of work required for LFMI\u2019s appeal was substantial and that the complexity of the issues involved fully supports this conclusion. This volume of work was required because LFMI faced an assessment of tax under Part XIII of the ITA of more than $25 million in circumstances that, to my knowledge, have not previously been considered by the Tax Court of Canada.\n[51] I note that the volume of work for LFMI was increased by certain strategic choices made by the Respondent such as the choice to seek full discovery of documents and the choice to amend the Reply following discovery. The Respondent was fully entitled to make these choices but must accept the reasonable cost consequences of such decisions.\n[52] The Bill of Costs attached as Exhibit B to LFMI\u2019s Affidavit states the number of hours spent by each person involved in the file and the hourly rate charged by each such person for those hours based on the year in which the work was performed. This Bill of Costs indicates that LFMI\u2019s counsel recorded a total of 3,207.5 hours on LFMI\u2019s file of which 691 hours are attributed to students-at-law. If I subtract the hours attributed to the students-at-law, the total lawyers\u2019 hours are 2516.3.\n[53] The total legal fees charged by counsel to LFMI is $1,573,407. I note that if the hours stated in the Bill of Costs is multiplied by the applicable hourly rates, the total is $1,745,159[36] indicating that LFMI\u2019s counsel discounted the amount charged to LFMI.\n[54] The Respondent takes issue with the full indemnity Bill of Costs provided by LFMI. I will address the Respondent\u2019s position on this Bill of Costs and the quantum of counsel\u2019s fees under my review of other relevant factors.\n[55] In conclusion, the volume of work and the complexity of the issues both support an appropriate award of costs to LFMI.\n6. Paragraph 147(3)(g) - The Conduct of any Party that Tended to Shorten or to Lengthen Unnecessarily the Duration of the Proceeding [56] LFMI and the Respondent did not make submissions regarding this factor.\n[57] The efforts of all counsel to shorten the proceedings by agreeing to the PASF are commendable but since these efforts benefitted all parties, they are not a factor in the awarding of costs in this appeal.\n7. Paragraph 147(3)(h) - The Denial or the Neglect or Refusal of any Party to Admit Anything that should have been Admitted [58] LFMI and the Respondent did not make submissions regarding this factor. I am not aware of anything that suggests this factor is relevant to an award of costs in this appeal.\n8. Paragraph 147(3)(i) - Whether any Stage in the Proceeding was Improper, Vexatious, or Unnecessary, or Taken through Negligence, Mistake or Excessive Caution [59] LFMI and the Respondent did not make submissions regarding this factor. I am not aware of anything that suggests this factor is relevant to an award of costs in this appeal.\n9. Paragraph 147(3)(i.1) - Whether the Expense Required to have an Expert Witness give Evidence was Justified [60] LFMI did not submit an expert report to the Court and did not seek reimbursement for the cost of an expert witness. Consequently, this factor is not relevant to an award of costs in this appeal.\n10. Paragraph 147(3)(j) - Any Other Matter Relevant to the Question of Costs\n[61] The Respondent challenges the legal fees incurred by LFMI and the disbursements claimed by LFMI.\n[62] With respect to the legal fees, the Respondent states:\n21. A description of costs incurred must provide some precision as to what was done, by whom, and when. LFMI\u2019s full indemnity bill of costs (Exhibit B) provides no such particulars: the fee description is a single sentence of 157 words that confuses more than it reveals. We have no idea who did what legal work, nor when the work took place. This description is inadequate. The Court should limit legal fees to a lump sump because of the impossibility to consider and evaluate LFMI\u2019s legal fees.\n22. LFMI\u2019s bill of costs states that the Class C Tariff amount is $36,300.26 The total legal fees claimed are $1,573,407. The Crown accepts that the Rule 147(3) factors of amounts in issue, importance of the issues, the volume of work, and the complexity of the issues weigh in favour of an amount above tariff.\n23. Here, four times the Class C Tariff, $145,200, is an appropriate lump sum award in light of the applicable Rule 147(3) factors. This approximates 10% of the legal fees claimed in LFMI\u2019s bill of costs.[37]\n[63] I agree that the information provided by counsel for LFMI in the full indemnity Bill of Costs is lacking and that the approach taken by counsel for HWLH in its Bill of Costs is considerably more informative. However, I note that if I remove the 691 hours attributed to students-at-law, the total hours of the lawyers who worked on the file is 2,516.3. This number is comparable to the 2,319.4 hours docketed by the lawyers who worked on HWLH\u2019s appeal and to the 2,200 hours docketed by the Department of Justice lawyers.\n[64] As well, if I deduct from the total fees of $1,573,407 the dollar value attributed to the work performed by the students-at-law, the total fees are reduced to $1,382,238[38] and the average hourly rate for counsel\u2019s hours is approximately $549 (i.e., $1,382,238 divided by 2,516.3).\n[65] In light of the fact that there is nothing to suggest that counsel for LFMI\u2019s overall numbers are incorrect and in light of the similar number of hours spent on the appeals by the lawyers for the other parties, I believe it is fair and reasonable to adjust for the lack of detail in LFMI\u2019s Bill of Costs by using $1,382,238 as the base for determining the award of costs to LFMI. I expressly reject the Respondent\u2019s submission that four times the amount computed under the Tariff is reasonable in the circumstances of this appeal.\n[66] I am not aware of any other factor that requires consideration.\nIII. The Disbursements Challenged by the Respondent\n[67] The Respondent challenges certain of LFMI\u2019s disbursements.[39] With the exception of the disbursement for the fee payable to Heuristica Discovery Counsel of $77,678.29, which I disallow, I remit the disbursements claimed by LFMI to this Court\u2019s taxing officer for determination.\n[68] With respect to the disbursement for the fee payable to Heuristica Discovery Counsel, I agree with the Respondent that it is not appropriate to embed legal fees in a claim for disbursements particularly when there is no description of the services provided for these fees or explanation of why counsel needed to incur these fees.\nIV. Conclusion Regarding the Award of Costs [69] The factors in favour of an award of costs to LFMI are the success of LFMI, the importance of the issues, the material amounts in issue, the volume of work and the complexity of the issues. There are no factors suggesting a reduction in the costs that would otherwise be awarded but for those factors.\n[70] The total legal fees incurred by LFMI that I have determined are a reasonable basis for determining LFMI\u2019s award for costs are $1,382,238.\n[71] I have considered the positive factors in the context of the appeal as a whole and the quantum of legal fees claimed by LFMI and I conclude that a reasonable and fair contribution to the legal fees of LFMI is the amount of $575,000. The amount of the disbursements allowed will be determined by the taxing officer subject to the exclusion of the disbursement for the fee payable to Heuristica Discovery Counsel.\nThis Amended Reasons for Order is issued in substitution of the Reasons for Order dated May 23, 2024 to correct a typographical omission contained in paragraph 69 of the original Reasons for Order.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 31st day of May 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

FACTS NOT AT ISSUE [1] Louis Zachary (the \u201cApplicant\u201d) is applying for an order for an extension of time to object under the Income Tax Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1] for the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\n[2] The Applicant is a Registered Indian pursuant to section 2(1) of the Indian Act. He is a member of the Haudenosaunee Iroquois Confederacy located in the Mohawk Territory of the Haudenosaunee Territory.\n[3] On June 4, 2015, the Minister assessed the Applicant\u2019s 2014 taxation year and issued a notice of assessment (the \u201c2014 Assessment\u201d).[2]\n[4] On October 16, 2019, the Applicant filed a notice of objection in respect to the 2014 Assessment (the \u201c2014 Objection\u201d), over four years after the 2014 Assessment was issued.[3]\n[5] On November 26, 2019, the Minister wrote a letter to the Applicant stating that the 2014 Objection was filed late, and pursuant to paragraph 166.1(7) of the Act, their objection could not be granted or accepted.[4]\n[6] On January 20, 2020, the Applicant filed this application for an extension of time to file notices of objection for the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years (the \u201cExtension Application\u201d).[5]\nII. ISSUES [7] Do the procedural requirements in order to object to an assessment, as set out in the Act, apply to the Applicant? If they do, am I able to grant the Extension Application?\nIII. THE APPLICANT\u2019S POSITION [8] The Applicant claims he paid income taxes in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He states that this tax was paid in error and thus he should be entitled to a refund.[6]\n[9] The Applicant appears to be making two main arguments. The first argument being that, pursuant to section 35 of the Constitution Act[7], the Act is not applicable to him (neither requiring him to pay income tax, nor to be bound by the provisions of the Act concerning the filing of an objection to an assessment).\n[10] The Applicant also argues that Treaty Indians are not citizens nor residents of Canada and thus he is not required to pay income tax.[8] In aid of this argument, the Applicant references various treaties.[9]\nIV. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION [11] The Minister asserts that the Applicant\u2019s 2014 Objection was filed late.[10]\n[12] Furthermore, the Minister states that no objection was ever filed in relation to the 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years.[11]\n[13] On March 4, 2020, the Respondent submitted an affidavit from Theresa Chichmanian (the \u201cAffidavit\u201d), an Officer in the Montreal Tax Services Office of the CRA.[12]\n[14] The Affidavit states that one of the conditions to filing an application with the Court for an extension of time for serving notices of objection with respect to the Applicant\u2019s 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years has not been met pursuant to subsection 166.2 of the Act, as no objections were filed in those years.[13]\n[15] The Respondent takes issues with what he describes as the constitutional arguments raised by the Applicant. Specifically, the Respondent argues that the presence of a constitutional argument at the application stage is irrelevant, as the only question before the Court relates to the filing of the objection, whereas the merits of the constitutional arguments would be addressed in a subsequently filed notice of appeal.[14]\n[16] Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has not articulated their constitutional challenge, and absent the Applicant following the proper procedures for bringing a constitutional challenge, their constitutional argument cannot move forward.[15]\n[17] The Respondent argues that the Applicant must fully articulate the constitutional question, serve a Notice of Constitutional Question in accordance with subsection 57(1) of the Federal Courts Act[16], and ensure there is a full evidentiary record in respect of the identified question. The Respondent argues the Applicant has not met any of these three criteria.[17]\nV. APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL ANALYSIS [18] In the following analysis, the term Indian is used, which is a subset of the term Aboriginal People, as it has legal meaning under the Indian Act[18] and the Constitution Act[19].\n[19] Indian is defined in section 2(1) of the Indian Act.\nIndian means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian;\n[20] Section 35(2) of the Constitution Act reads:\n35(2) Definition of \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\"\nIn this Act, \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\" includes the Indian, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada.\n[21] The Applicant argues that as a Registered Indian, he is not a citizen nor a resident of Canada, and therefore the procedural requirements under the Act are not applicable to him.[20]\n[22] It must be noted that the representative for the Applicant, during hearings on November 22, 2022, and June 26, 2023, stated the Applicant was not making a constitutional challenge. The Applicant states at paragraph (D) of the Notice of Appeal that:\nThe Income Tax Act applies to Canadian Residents, not Hausdenoshaune Iroquois Confederacy Treaty Indians. Mr. Louis Zachery is not Canadian Resident or United States Citizen therefore, he is exempt from paying Income Tax.\n[23] Although the Applicant states that he is not advancing a constitutional question, the thrust of what he is asserting in at least one of his arguments is that subsection 35(1) of the Constitution Act exempts him from paying income tax under the Act, and further the application of the Act as a whole is inapplicable to him. Although not formulated as a constitutional question, what the Applicant is challenging in this hearing is the applicability of sections 166.1 and 166.2 of the Act to Registered Indians, based on subsection 35(1) of the Constitution Act.\n[24] In Thompson v. MNR[21], Justice Trudel of the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the need for a notice of constitutional question is linked to the remedy sought by a party. If an applicant does not seek a finding that the provisions of an act are invalid, inapplicable, or inoperative, then no notice is required.\n67 The need for a notice of constitutional question is linked to the remedy sought by a party: Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2004 FCA 66, [2004] 3 F.C.R. 436 (F.C.A.). Section 57 of the Federal Courts Act states that the constitutional validity, applicability, or operability of an Act of Parliament shall not be judged unless notice has been served. Neither in his Notice of Appeal nor in the Order Sought section of his memorandum of fact and law does the appellant seek a finding that the provisions of the Act under which the Minister acted in this case are invalid, inapplicable or inoperable as required by section 57. As a result, it is not necessary to address the question raised in the notice of constitutional question.\n[25] Based upon the above analysis, it is clear that at least part of the Applicant\u2019s argument comes by way of advancing a Constitutional question. Specifically, the Applicant is arguing that the provisions of the Act are inapplicable to him as a Status Indian. I must therefore determine whether the Applicant has met the requirements to make such an argument to the Court.\n[26] In order to advance a Constitutional question, the Applicant must have filed a Notice of Constitutional Question pursuant to section 19.2 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, RSC 1985 c T-2. This Notice must clearly identify the Constitutional question in issue. This has not been done. Therefore I will not rule upon the Constitutional question. Even if I were to allow the Constitutional argument to proceed, there is no evidence before the Court that supports the argument.\nA. Citizens and Residents of Canada\n[27] The Applicant\u2019s second argument is that Treaty Indians are not citizens of Canada, and as such he does not have to pay taxes.\n[28] In considering this argument, the first question that must be answered is whether Status Indians are citizens of Canada[22].\n[29] In Mitchell v. MNR[23], the respondent was a Mohwak of Akwesasne and descendant of the Mohawk Nation. The respondent had crossed the Canada\/US border and refused to pay custom tax, arguing that an aboriginal right existed that exempted him from paying duty. Then Supreme Court Chief Justice McLachlin discussed the history of aboriginal people in Canada and the entrenchment of their rights in the Constitution Act.\n9. Long before Europeans explored and settled North America, aboriginal peoples were occupying and using most of this vast expanse of land in organized, distinctive societies with their own social and political structures. The part of North America we now call Canada was first settled by the French and the British who, from the first days of exploration, claimed sovereignty over the land on behalf of their nations. English law, which ultimately came to govern aboriginal rights, accepted that the aboriginal peoples possessed pre-existing laws and interests, and recognized their continuance in the absence of extinguishment, by cession, conquest, or legislation: see, e.g., the Royal Proclamation, 1763, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1, and R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075 (S.C.C.), at p. 1103. At the same time, however, the Crown asserted that sovereignty over the land, and ownership of its underlying title, vested in the Crown: Sparrow, supra. With this assertion arose an obligation to treat aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and to protect them from exploitation, a duty characterized as \"fiduciary\" in Guerin v. R., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 (S.C.C.).\n10. Accordingly, European settlement did not terminate the interests of aboriginal peoples arising from their historical occupation and use of the land. To the contrary, aboriginal interests and customary laws were presumed to survive the assertion of sovereignty, and were absorbed into the common law as rights, unless (1) they were incompatible with the Crown's assertion of sovereignty, (2) they were surrendered voluntarily via the treaty process, or (3) the government extinguished them: see B. Slattery, \"Understanding Aboriginal Rights\" (1987), 66 Can. Bar Rev. 727. Barring one of these exceptions, the practices, customs and traditions that defined the various aboriginal societies as distinctive cultures continued as part of the law of Canada: see Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1973] S.C.R. 313 (S.C.C.), and Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2) (1992), 175 C.L.R. 1 (Australia H.C.), at p. 57 (per Brennan J.), pp. 81-82 (per Deane and Gaudron JJ.), and pp. 182-83 (per Toohey J.).\n11. The common law status of aboriginal rights rendered them vulnerable to unilateral extinguishment, and thus they were \"dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign\": see St. Catharines Milling & Lumber Co. v. R. (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46 (Canada P.C.), at p. 54. This situation changed in 1982, when Canada's constitution was amended to entrench existing aboriginal and treaty rights: Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35(1). The enactment of s. 35(1) elevated existing common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status (although, it is important to note, the protection offered by s. 35(1) also extends beyond the aboriginal rights recognized at common law: Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 (S.C.C.), at para. 136). Henceforward, aboriginal rights falling within the constitutional protection of s. 35 could not be unilaterally abrogated by the government. However, the government retained the jurisdiction to limit aboriginal rights for justifiable reasons, in the pursuit of substantial and compelling public objectives: see R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723 (S.C.C.), and Delgamuukw, supra.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[30] Grand Chief Mitchell\u2019s claim of an aboriginal right was dismissed, as the Supreme Court found that he had not shown the right existed. Justice Binnie, concurring in result, went on to quote Justice Dickson (as he then was) and state that Indians are citizens of Canada, subject to all the responsibilities of other Canadian citizens.\n132 [\u2026] In other respects however, the respondent and other aboriginal people live and contribute as part of our national diversity. So too in the Court's definition of aboriginal rights. They find their source in an earlier age, but they have not been frozen in time. They are, as has been said, rights not relics. They are projected into modern Canada where they are exercised as group rights in the 21st century by modern Canadians who wish to preserve and protect their aboriginal identity.\n133 In the earlier years of the century the federal government occasionally argued that Parliament's jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 (\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\") was plenary. Indians were said to be federal people whose lives were wholly subject to federal \"regulation\". This was rejected by the courts, which ruled that while an aboriginal person could be characterized as an Indian for some purposes including language, culture and the exercise of traditional rights, he or she does not cease thereby to be a resident of a province or territory. For other purposes he or she must be recognized and treated as an ordinary member of Canadian society. In a decision handed down soon after the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982, Nowegijick v. R., [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29 (S.C.C.), a tax case, Dickson J. (as he then was) wrote at p. 36,\" Indians are citizens and, in affairs of life not governed by treaties or the Indian Act, they are subject to all of the responsibilities of other Canadian citizens\". See also Birth Registration No. 67-09-022272, Re, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 751 (S.C.C.), per Laskin C.J. at p. 763, and R. v. Tenale, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 309 (S.C.C.), per Beetz J., at p. 326. In Gladstone (at para. 73) and again in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 (S.C.C.) (at para. 165), Lamer C.J. repeats that \"distinctive aboriginal societies exist within, and are a part of, a broader social, political and economic community, over which the Crown is sovereign\" (emphasis added). The constitutional objective is reconciliation not mutual isolation.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[31] The Applicant\u2019s argument that he is not a citizen of Canada must fail.\nB. Subject to Procedural Requirements\n[32] The next question is, as a citizen of Canada, is the Applicant subject to the procedural requirements under the Act? This must be answered in the affirmative.\n[33] The scenario before the Court is almost on all fours with the decision in Horseman,[24] in which the Applicant was seeking an extension of time to appeal a GST assessment where the request was made outside of the statutorily mandated timelines. The Applicant also sought to raise constitutional arguments.\n[34] The Court in that instance had to decide whether the Act\u2019s prerequisite provisions for filing of a notice of appeal, including temporal and procedural limitations, applied notwithstanding that the prospective Applicant\u2019s intended argument was that the Act was unconstitutional in its application to Indians. The application was denied on the basis that the Applicant had not fulfilled the prerequisite provisions for filing a notice of appeal, regardless of the prospective argument of the appeal being based on constitutional grounds.\n[35] On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Russel\u2019s decision and stated that procedural provisions apply and must be obeyed even where the constitutional rights and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples are asserted.[25]\n3. In dismissing the appellant's application, the Tax Court found (at para. 37) that the appellant had not filed a valid objection to the assessment, a statutory prerequisite for an appeal to the Court, and was now out of time. Further, the Tax Court held (at para. 24) that the provisions of the Act concerning objections and appeals apply even where a person intends to raise arguments based on the constitutional rights of Indigenous peoples. In this regard, the Tax Court emphasized (at para. 23) that the appellant was making \"a private claim [...], seeking monetary relief in respect of his personal tax situation.\" The appellant appeals to this Court.\n4. In our view, the appeal must fail. In private, personal claims such as this, procedural and jurisdictional provisions apply and must be obeyed even where the constitutional rights and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples are asserted: Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245; Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman, 2008 SCC 14[2008] 1 S.C.R. 372 at para. 13; Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14[2013] 1 S.C.R. 623 at para. 134. This case law is a subset of a larger body of case law requiring that those asserting personal, private claims founded upon constitutional rights must still comply with statutory limitation periods and other procedural and jurisdictional requirements: see, e.g., R. v. Mills, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863 (S.C.C.) at page 953; Ravndahl v. Saskatchewan, 2009 SCC 7, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 181 ; St-Onge c. R., 2001 FCA 308, 288 N.R. 3; Newman v. R., 2016 FCA 213, 406 D.L.R. (4th) 602 and the many cases cited therein.\n5. The appellant notes that the exemption from taxation contained in subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 opens with the words \"[n]otwithstanding any other Act of Parliament...\". He submits that this means that the procedural and jurisdictional requirements in the Excise Tax Act do not apply.\n6. We disagree. The opening words of section 87 prevent other Acts of Parliament imposing taxes contrary to the substantive exemption granted by section 87. They do not displace procedural and jurisdictional requirements such as where, when and how a proceeding is to be brought. Were it otherwise, what would stop a person from going directly to the Supreme Court of Canada at any time, perhaps a decade or more later, to claim the section 87 exemption at first instance?\n7. The Tax Court was correct in concluding that the application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal must be dismissed. The Tax Court has jurisdiction over such an application only where the requirements of the Excise Tax Act, above, ss. 301-307 are met, including the requirement that a valid notice of objection be filed: Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, s. 12. One was not filed here.\n8. We see no reviewable error in the Tax Court's findings of fact and substantially agree with the legal analysis of the Tax Court as it pertains to those facts (at paras. 25-42).\n[Emphasis added.]\n[36] Therefore, in order to be successful in this Application, Mr. Zachary must have met the procedural requirements of the Act, concerning the filing of a Notice of Objection. This is considered below.\nC. Extension Application\n[37] I must now determine whether to accept this Extension Application and thus allow the Applicant to file his various objections past the normal 90-day objection period.\n[38] Subsection 165(1) of the Act reads as follows:\n165 (1) A taxpayer who objects to an assessment under this Part may serve on the Minister a notice of objection, in writing, setting out the reasons for the objection and all relevant facts,\n(a) if the assessment is in respect of the taxpayer for a taxation year and the taxpayer is an individual (other than a trust) or a graduated rate estate for the year, on or before the later of\n(i) the day that is one year after the taxpayer\u2019s filing-due date for the year, and\n(ii) the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment; and\n(b) in any other case, on or before the day that is 90 days after the day of sending of the notice of assessment.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[39] The Applicant did not meet the 90-day objection period. The notice of assessment for the 2014 taxation year was dated June 4, 2015. The Applicant objected to the 2014 taxation year on October 16, 2019, 1,596 days later.\n[40] The Applicant, if he wished to object to the 2014 taxation year, must then have filed a section 166.1 application with the Minister requesting an extension of time to file an objection.\nExtension of time by Minister\n166.1 (1) Where no notice of objection to an assessment has been served under section 165, nor any request under subsection 245(6) made, within the time limited by those provisions for doing so, the taxpayer may apply to the Minister to extend the time for serving the notice of objection or making the request.\n[41] This application must be filed within one-year after the 90-day objection period. Unfortunately, the Applicant did not do this.\n(7) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application is made within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[42] After requesting an extension from the Minister, a taxpayer may request the Tax Court of Canada to grant the application using section 166.2. A pre-condition to making a section 166.2 extension application is that a taxpayer must have filed a section 166.1 extension application with the Minister. This was not done.\nExtension of time by Tax Court\n166.2 (1) A taxpayer who has made an application under subsection 166.1 may apply to the Tax Court of Canada to have the application granted after either\n(a) the Minister has refused the application, or\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the application under subsection 166.1(1) and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer of the Minister\u2019s decision,\nbut no application under this section may be made after the expiration of 90 days after the day on which notification of the decision was mailed to the taxpayer.\nThis application, like the section 166.1 application to the Minister, must be made within one-year after the 90-day objection period.\n(5) No application shall be granted under this section unless\n(a) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) within one year after the expiration of the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving a notice of objection or making a request, as the case may be; and\n(b) the taxpayer demonstrates that\n(i) within the time otherwise limited by this Act for serving such a notice or making such a request, as the case may be, the taxpayer\n(A) was unable to act or to instruct another to act in the taxpayer\u2019s name, or\n(B) had a bona fide intention to object to the assessment or make the request,\n(ii) given the reasons set out in the application and the circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable to grant the application, and\n(iii) the application was made under subsection 166.1(1) as soon as circumstances permitted.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[43] If no application was filed with the Minister under section 166.1, an application to the Tax Court of Canada under section 166.2 is invalid.[26]\n[44] Furthermore, if a taxpayer misses the 90-day deadline to apply to the Tax Court of Canada after the Minister rejects a section 166.1 application, the Tax Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to hear the application.[27]Therefore, the request for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection for the 2014 taxation year must be denied.\n[45] For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years, no notices of objections were ever filed by the Applicant. No requests for an extension of time to file a Notice of Objection were ever filed either. Therefore I must deny the application for an extension of time to file a notice of objection for these years as well.\nVI. CONCLUSION [46] Mr. Zachary is citizen of Canada, and therefore, any argument that the Act or its procedural provisions are not applicable to him must fail.\n[47] This Court cannot grant the Applicant\u2019s Extension Application as it does not meet the procedural requirements under the Act, namely that it be filed within the statutory timelines as well as having followed the correct extension procedure.\n[48] The Application is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 23rd day of January 2024.\n\u201cR.

Introduction\n[1] This is an appeal by Mr. Kabir Cheema from a reassessment made by notice dated July 2, 2021, under the Income Tax Act (Act), in respect of his 2016 taxation year (Reassessment). In reassessing the Appellant for that year beyond the normal reassessment period under subsection 152(4) of the Act, the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) increased the Appellant\u2019s income by a total amount of $133,187. The inclusion consists of two sources: (1) a profit imposed on income account of $72,968 realized on the disposition of a real property on Falconridge Drive NE, Calgary, Alberta (Property) and (2) using an alternative assessment technique named the bank deposit analysis (BDA), an undeclared income of $60,219 (Unreported Revenue). The Minister imposed no gross negligence penalties under section 163 of the Act.\n[2] The Appellant has instituted the Appeal under the informal procedure. In the event of a complete or partial success, the Appellant will then be subject to the limitation applicable to appeal in informal procedure exceeding $25,000, leaving him liable with respect to any excess.\n[3] The Appellant was at the relevant time a real estate associate in the Calgary region. He started in 2016 until he applied in 2018 before the Real Estate Council of Alberta for a voluntary lifetime withdrawal from industry membership.\nII. Issues in Dispute\n[4] There are two main issues that have to be decided in this appeal:\nwhether the Minister is statute barred from reassessing the Appellant under paragraph 152(4)(a) of the Act; which in essence requires the Court to decide whether the Appellant made a misrepresentation in filing his 2016 income tax return attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default with respect of the Property, the Unreported Revenue, or both; and\nif so, whether the Minister is justified to reassess the Appellant and include the amount of $133,197 or a part thereof, related to the Property and the Unreported Revenue, in his 2016 income tax return.\n[5] Although the first issue will be addressed first, the determination of the second issue is relevant and crucial to the determination of the first, particularly in determining whether there has been a misrepresentation in filing the Appellant\u2019s 2016 tax return, which is alleged to be the total undeclared disposition of the Property and the Unreported Revenue. Accordingly, I will address both undeclared income issues at the time and in the context of determining whether there has been a misrepresentation and if so, deal with the issue of whether the same would amount to neglect, carelessness or wilful default afterwards. Each source will be addressed separately.\nIII. Position of the Parties\n[6] The Appellant argued that he did not earn an undeclared income of $133,187 in 2016, and neither would he have made a gain of $72,968 in selling the Property or failed to include a revenue of $60,219 in his income.\n[7] The Appellant adds that he did not make a misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default and did not commit fraud. The Appellant is of the view that specific expenses reduced any gain on the sale of the Property to nil. And, pointing to a number of bank entries of one specific bank account while the Appellant operates through various bank accounts is not sufficient for the Respondent to meet the Respondent\u2019s burden in order to reassess the Unreported Revenue. Supposition and conjuncture are not sufficient. Therefore, the Respondent is foreclosed from reassessing the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year.\n[8] According to the Respondent, the Appellant made a false statement\/misrepresentation in his 2016 income tax return in admitting his omission to declare the sale of the Property because he thought no gains resulted from the sale. Failing to explain bank statements supporting the Unreported Revenue resulted also in a false statement by the Appellant. The Respondent is also of the view that it was established that the misrepresentations in reporting his income were attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default. The Respondent\u2019s onus under subparagraph 154(4)(a)(i) of the Act is not particularly heavy.\n[9] In support of the Respondent\u2019s position in respect of the Property and the Unreported Revenue inclusions, paragraph 7 of the Reply includes the following assumptions of fact that the Minister relied on to reassess the Appellant:\nAbout the Property:\ni) the Appellant was involved in real estate disposition transactions in the 2016 taxation year;\nii) the Appellant owned property located at 1243 Falconridge Drive NE, Calgary, Alberta (the \u201cProperty\u201d);\niii) the Appellant described the Property as a two bedroom, one bath bungalow with a detached two car garage;\niv) the Appellant held the Property from October 20, 2016 to November 21, 2016, a period of 33 days;\nv) the Appellant never listed the Property for rent;\nvi) the Appellant sold the Property in November of 2016;\nvii) the Appellant incurred a gain of $72,967.50 from the sale of the Property, calculated as follows:\nProceeds of Disposition $290,231.00\nLess: Adjusted Cost Base $215,416.00\nLess: Outlays & Expenses $1,847.50\nGain Realized on Disposition $72,967.50\nviii) the Appellant did not report $72,967.50 of profits from the sale of the Property;\nix) the gain from the sale of the Property was on income account;\nAbout the Unreported Revenue:\nx) the Appellant held a personal bank account at BMO ending in 3507 (\u201c3507\u201d) in the 2016 taxation year;\nxi) 3507 was the Appellant\u2019s primary bank account;\nxii) only the Appellant\u2019s income was deposited into 3507;\nxiii) the Appellant\u2019s spouse held her own personal bank account for which she only made deposits of her income into that account;\nxiv) deposits of income from the Appellant\u2019s spouse and other family members were not made to 3507;\nxv) the Appellant reported total income of $175,781 in the 2016 taxation year, calculated as follows:\nYear 2016\nUniversal Child Care Benefits $ 720\nDividends $ 2,106\nGross Commission Income $ 172,955\nTotal Reported Income $ 175,781;\nxvi) the Appellant earned and failed to report income of $60,219 in the 2016 taxation year.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Law\n[10] Subsection 152(3.1) of the Act sets out the normal periods for reassessing. I do not believe that there is any dispute that the reassessment under appeal was made outside the normal assessment period so it is not necessary to delve into the detail of such provision.\n[11] Subsection 152(4) of the Act is a provision that allows the Minister to reassess a taxpayer\u2019s return outside the normal assessment period. The part relevant to this appeal reads as follows:\n(4) Assessment and reassessment. The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom in a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a)The taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act, or\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[Underlining added.]\n[12] No fraud is alleged by the Respondent. And there is no waiver filed with the Minister.\n[13] The purpose of a statutory limitation period is to give some certainty to the tax system. In the Tingley [1] decision, the Tax Court mentions about the normal assessment period:\nThe very purpose of the limitation period is to provide a window during which the Minister may review and make such reassessment and yet provide the taxpayer who has not made misrepresentations some certainty in their tax affairs.\n[14] Clearly, the goal of certainty expressed above is dependent on the taxpayer not having made any misrepresentations. Where a misrepresentation is made, subsection 152(4) of the Act allows the Minister to reassess beyond the normal reassessment period. However, such provision has limits. About lost opportunities to collect taxes, in Regina Shoppers [2], the Federal Court of Appeal states:\nThe mere fact that a taxpayer may ultimately benefit from a failure of the taxing authority to properly reassess obviously does not constitute authority for reassessment which is not found in the legislation itself. There is no rule of equity or of common law which may somehow assist the taxing authority to obtain revenue which it has lost solely and entirely through its own negligence or failure to exercise the powers granted to it by the Act.\n[15] Therefore, if the Minister can support that the conditions of paragraph 152(4)(a) of the Act are satisfied, this will mean that the Minister has the legislative authority to pursue the lost revenue. In Jencik [3], Bonner J stated this premise clearly:\nThe Minister\u2019s right to reassess for 1994 to 1998 [the \u201cstatute barred years\u201d] was therefore dependent on the Appellant having made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or having committed fraud as set out in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act.\n[16] In DiCosmo [4], the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the issue of whether an assessment is statute-barred must be specifically pleaded in order to ensure fairness and to permit all evidence to be put before the Court.\n[17] In the case at bar, the Notice of Appeal raised the issue of the Reassessment issued after the normal reassessment period. In addition, the Respondent is of the view to have fulfilled the conditions to rely on paragraph 152(4) of the Act beyond the normal reassessment period. Therefore, the statute-bar issue is properly before the Court and will be addressed with respect to each issue under appeal.\n[18] In Vine Estate [5], Webb JA described the Minister\u2019s onus to support a reassessment beyond the normal reassessment period in a two-step process as follows:\nIn this case, there is no allegation of any fraud. Therefore, the onus is on the Minister to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the taxpayer or the person filing the return:\n(a) has made a misrepresentation; and\n(b) such misrepresentation is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default.\n[19] Webb JA further stated:\nAs in any civil case, if a person has the onus of proof for particular facts, the question for the trier of fact is whether, based on all of the evidence admitted during the hearing, that person has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that such facts exist. There is no shifting onus.\n[20] The misrepresentation through neglect or carelessness or wilful default required under subsection 152(4) of the Act must have been made when filing the return. A misrepresentation has occurred if there is an incorrect statement on the return form, at least one that is material to the purposes of the return and to any future reassessment. It remains a misrepresentation even if the Minister could or does, by a careful analysis of the supporting material, perceive the error on the return form. Generally, it is established when the taxpayer fails to exercise reasonable care in complying with the Act. [6] It would undermine the self-reporting nature of the tax system if taxpayers could be careless in the completion of returns while providing accurate basic data in working papers, on the chance that the Minister would not find the error but, if he did within four years, the worst consequence would be a correct reassessment at that time. [7] This latter position from the Federal Court of Appeal is decisive in the present appeal.\n[21] In a statute barred year situation, and an alternative assessment technique was used, a taxpayer can win by showing that the Minister\u2019s alternative assessment technique is fundamentally flawed. The Bousfield [8] decision also summarized the ways a taxpayer can attack an alternative assessment technique:\n(a) by showing that the taxpayer\u2019s income or revenue can be more accurately calculated using the taxpayer\u2019s own books and records;\n(b) by accepting that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister is appropriate but attacking components of the calculation in an effort to reduce the income or revenue;\n(c) if the year in question is statute barred, by showing that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister is fundamentally flawed;\n(d) by presenting a different alternative assessment technique that more accurately calculates the taxpayer\u2019s income or revenue; or\n(e) by accepting that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister was appropriate but showing that the income or revenue calculated by the technique was from a non-taxable source.\nB. Property\n[22] The evidence at the hearing supported, on the balance of probabilities, that the Appellant did not declare the disposition of the Property in filing his 2016 income tax return, and the explanation and evidence provided by the Appellant for not doing so, that his expenses have erased any possible gain, did not convince the Court. The Court is of the view that a misrepresentation was clearly made when filing the 2016 return and such was done through negligence or at least carelessness or wilful default as required under subsection 152(4) of the Act. The Minister was then allowed to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year.\n[23] Two individuals testified at the hearing: the auditor from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) having signed the audit report for the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year and the Appellant. Both were called by the Appellant and were cross-examined by the Respondent.\n[24] One important factor is that the Appellant\u2019s written submissions maintain that the Appellant should be entitled to a capital gain treatment and that gain should be reduced to $12,467 (as opposed to the Minister\u2019s determination of $72,967). The $12,467 gain, whether on income or capital account, is the gain determined by the Minister less two additional expenses that were introduced in evidence by the Appellant at the hearing. A first referral fee of $40,500 paid by the Appellant to 1728778 Alberta Ltd. (then doing business under First Point Financial and held 50-50 by the Appellant and his partner Mr. Maninder Walia) and a second referral fee of $20,000 paid by the Appellant to Mrs. Kanwaldeep Walia (Mr. Walia\u2019s spouse). According to the Appellant, both referral fees were paid in connection with the sale of the Property. The Appellant referred to several documents to support his right to the deductions including a document (Exhibit A-5) prepared by him to support the expenses incurred in selling the Property, the Statement of Adjustments and Trust Statement prepared by counsel acting on the sale, and more specifically a one-page document (Exhibit A-6) presented for each arrangement supporting the existence of the referral fee claimed and referred to in the document. The Appellant has confirmed that these arrangement documents were not submitted to the CRA as they did not request them.\n[25] In addition, the Court is not convinced that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence introduced at the hearing, including the Appellant\u2019s testimony, supports that the Appellant can claim an additional total expense of $60,500 against the gain realised on the sale of the Property. The evidential weight of the documents listed in paragraph 24 to establish the nature of the two payments made and claimed at the hearing as expenses is not sufficient. The documents are far too ambiguous, vague, unclear and unreliable as to the true nature of the payments made at closing. A clear contradiction exists between what the parties to the arrangements may have agreed on and the explanation submitted by the Appellant at the hearing. And, one of the two documents is incomplete. In both cases, it seems like if the parties were looking to achieve two opposite results, one being making a non taxable payment (a loan agreement) and another being making a taxable payment (a referral fee). Unfortunately, this duality has the opposite effect and creates uncertainty, as it cannot be both. No other witness testified to give a clear meaning to these arrangements. Only one thing is clear, the arrangements supposedly entered into the parties are not clear. And, with such ambiguity, the Court cannot rely on the sole testimony of the Appellant to conclude that the real and sole intention was to pay commissions.\n[26] The Court is not prepared to consider any other potential expenses against the sale of the Property. The Appellant did not properly address or introduce any of these other possible expenses, and at the face of the document that may support each such expense, none has showed any sufficient probative value.\n[27] In that context, the Court is forced to deny the tax treatment claimed by the Appellant. The Respondent has satisfied his burden under subsection 152(4) of the Act and the remaining evidence submitted at the hearing does not satisfy, on the balance of probabilities, a different result. The Court is satisfied that an unreported gain was realized by the Appellant and the expenses claimed as introduced cannot be allowed as the Court is not convinced of their probative value.\n[28] As to whether the gain shall be on capital or income account, the absence of any disclosure of such disposition by the Appellant in filing his 2016 income tax return forces the Court to rely only on the evidence at the hearing to determine whether the income account treatment should stand. On this point, the Appellant did not elaborate except to maintain that he wanted to rent the Property. Unfortunately, the details and the issues faced by the Appellant about the financing structure, the circumstances leading the Appellant to show an interest in the Property, his experience as a real estate agent at the time, his knowledge about the possible role of the Alberta Health Services (AHS), the probative sale rules that governed the sale of the Property, the reasons for not being able to realize, not until the sale of the Property was finalised, the status and the conditions of the Property do not convince the Court that the determination of a sudden sale came to mind.\n[29] Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the real intent of the Appellant, when showing interest in buying the Property, was at all relevant times for rental purposes only. The financial aspect of the project, the discovery in entering the house, the immediate and promptness of renovation on the main floor and in the basement, while the Appellant would have been overtaken by discouragement due to the appearance of the premises and a trip to India for family emergency, are difficult to conceive. The Court finds it hard to believe that the Appellant was faced with so many events in such a short period of time that the only option was to sell the Property quickly and make a profit of approximately $70,000, all in one-month of ownership. The Appellant\u2019s motivations in this project deserve more credit. Unfortunately, the Court believes that the probative value of the Appellant\u2019s testimony is insufficient to support a recharacterization of the gain realized on the sale of the Property. The Court is facing a lack of evidence to support, on the balance of probabilities, the Appellant\u2019s position to claim a different characterization of the gain. In other words, the evidence is not sufficient to reverse the Reassessment.\nC. Unreported Revenue\n[30] Unfortunately for the Appellant, the same conclusion should apply with respect to the Unreported Revenue and the conditions of subsection 152(4) of the Act. A misrepresentation was clearly made when filing the 2016 return and such was done through negligence, carelessness or wilful default as required under subsection 152(4) of the Act. The Minister was then allowed to reassess the Appellant\u2019s 2016 taxation year.\n[31] Before the Court reviews whether the Respondent has met the burden imposed by subsection 152(4) of the Act, it should be said that subsection 152(7) of the Act allows the Minister to assess a taxpayer using an alternative assessment technique. [9] The subsection does not establish a specific technique that must be used. [10] And, the Court does not have to be satisfied that it was necessary for the Minister to use an alternative assessment technique. The Minister can use an alternative assessment technique at any time regardless of the state of the taxpayer\u2019s records. [11]\n[32] In addition, in the Lacroix [12] decision, the Federal Court of Appeal dealing with a situation of a reassessment issued beyond the normal reassessment period and where the reassessment was based on a net worth method, confirmed that the Respondent in order to satisfy the burden under subsection 152(4) of the Act does not need to prove the source of income detected through the application of the alternative assessment technique used by the CRA. In addition, about the burden of proof under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) of the Act, the Federal Court of Appeal added:\n[32] What, then, of the burden of proof on the Minister? How does he discharge this burden? There may be circumstances where the Minister would be able to show direct evidence of the taxpayer\u2019s state of mind at the time the tax return was filed. However, in the vast majority of cases, the Minister will be limited to undermining the taxpayer\u2019s credibility by either adducing evidence or cross-examining the taxpayer. Insofar as the Tax Court of Canada is satisfied that the taxpayer earned unreported income and did not provide a credible explanation for the discrepancy between his or her reported income and his or her net worth, the Minister has discharged the burden of proof on him within the meaning of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(i) and subsection 162(3).\n[33] In the present case, the central point is about a list of deposits the Appellant made in 2016 in his main bank account with Bank of Montreal (BMO Account). The CRA conducted his BDA audit referring only to the BMO Account although the Appellant had others accounts with various financial institutions. The Appellant was asked to explain a list of deposits in the BMO Account. In the event no or unsatisfactory explanation was provided, the CRA would consider such deposits as Unreported Revenue.\n[34] The Appellant\u2019s submissions in respect of the Unreported Revenue and the CRA\u2019s BDA refer to several points that the Court would like to briefly comment on.\n[35] First, the Appellant argued that all his bank accounts were not reviewed by the CRA and exclusions from taxable deposits were missing. On this point, the Appellant was allowed to introduce all evidence and explanations about any and all situations he may perceive or believe to be relevant to support his case. This was entirely within the Appellant\u2019s discretion and the Appellant cannot rely on how the CRA conducted the audit to support his position. The Act does not force the CRA to act in a specific or particular manner when conducting au audit. The CRA has some flexibilities in this regard, although not all conducts are allowed. But, in this case, the situation was under the Appellant\u2019s control.\n[36] Second, the presence of two auditors is not, in and of itself, a reason to support the position of the Appellant. The Appellant knew that position of the CRA and had occasions to submit his explanations, including before the Court in a full day hearing. This is not the role of the Court or possible for the Appellant to direct the CRA on how to conduct an audit.\n[37] Finally, and the most relevant part of the Appellant\u2019s submissions are reference to specific cheques that the Appellant argued shall reduce the amount of unidentified Deposits and therefore the Unreported Revenue amount. The Appellant referred to Exhibits A-2, A-3 and A-4.\n[38] The Appellant\u2019s reference to Exhibits A-3 and A-4 is difficult to understand in the present case as the Unreported Revenue relies on BMO Account transfers and the Appellant relied on two cheques from 1728778 Alberta Ltd. (Exhibit A-4) to argue non-taxable deposits from the corporation. The difficulty is that these two cheques do not appear on the list of deposits the Appellant was asked to explain in Exhibit A-1 (Explanation of Final Adjustments \u2013 2016). And, the two cheques from the corporation have not been deposited into the BMO Account at least not directly but in Scotia Bank account. In any event, if it is only for that reason and the discussions that took place at the hearing about the two cheques, the Court does not believe that the shareholders loans situation is particularly relevant here.\n[39] The Appellant\u2019s reference to Exhibit A-2 is different. The Appellant thought that specific cheques listed in Exhibit A-2 justifies a reduction of the unidentified deposits listed in CRA\u2019s Explanation of Final Adjustments - 2016 in Exhibit A-1 (page 3). After a careful review of Exhibits A-1 and A-2, the Court is of the view that the circumstances support that all the cheques in Exhibit A-2 (except for one dated May 25, 2015) are in the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3). Most of the 12 cheques in Exhibit A-2 are listed individually on page 3 of Exhibit A-1 except for two sequences where one deposit is considered to have been made for two cheques. On the unidentified deposits list on page 3 of Exhibit A-1, the $17,132 deposit (dated February 11, 2016) of Exhibit A-1 is considered to be for cheques in the amount of $14,132 and $3,000 (dated February 9 and 10, 2016, respectively) of Exhibit A-2, and the deposit of $4,225 (dated June 6, 2016) of Exhibit A-1 is considered to be for cheques in the amount of $3,530 and $695 (both dated June 3, 2016) of Exhibit A-2.\n[40] 10 cheques are from the Appellant (inter-account transfers) and two are from a third party. The Respondent is of the view that the 10 personal cheques do not reflect, in and of itself, a sufficient explanation to justify to be removed from the unidentified deposits list. The reason is that the same exercise as completed with the deposits in the BMO Account should be completed with the other Appellant\u2019s account where the cheque is drawn from. Without this duplicate exercise, it would be too obvious to rely on false explanations. The Court accepts the Respondent\u2019s position in this respect. Unfortunately, the Appellant did not provide such backup, and the Respondent cannot be find responsible for that.\n[41] This evidence with respect to the 10 personal cheques is lacking as it does not explain the source of the funds that came initially from the Appellant\u2019s other personal bank accounts. The Court is unable to ascertain the nature of the funds transferred to the BMO Account. Nothing precludes such funds from being commissions or taxable income. The Court cannot therefore accept that, on the balance of probabilities, such funds shall be excluded from the variance as being not taxable while no proof exists as to the nature of the source fund itself.\n[42] With respect to the remaining cheques, the Respondent has conceded that one should be allowed and removed from the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3). The cheque is in the amount of $5,000.\n[43] As for the last cheque from 1842290 Alberta Ltd. of $14,132, the situation was discussed in the examination-in-chief of the CRA auditor. The auditor came back on his initial position that the cheque was included in the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3) to say that it was ultimeraly not. And, because it was not, it should not be backed out either. With the $5,000 cheque, the auditor confirmed it was on the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3) so it could be removed.\n[44] The review by the Court of the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3) and Exhibit A-2 allows a different conclusion. The Court, as explained in paragraph 39 above, believes that a deposit in the amount of $17,132 on February 11, 2016 includes in fact the $14,132 cheque. Considering that the Court understands from the Respondent\u2019s position that the sole reason for not excluding the cheque from 1842290 Alberta Ltd. in the amount of $14,132 from the unidentified deposits list of Exhibit A-1 (page 3) is the fact that the cheque was not originally listed, the Court is inclined to give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt and accept that an additional $14,132 should be withdrawn from the list like for the $5,000 conceded by the Respondent.\nV. Conclusion\n[45] Based on the foregoing, the appeal will be allowed, without costs, and the Reassessment is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the Appellant\u2019s Unreported Revenue shall be reduced by the amount of $19,132.00 from $60,219.00 to $41,087.00. This reduction shall be the sole adjustment.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 31st day of May 2024.\n\u201cJ M Gagnon\u201d\nGagnon J\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 81\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2022-2125(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nKABIR CHEEMA v.

Introduction\n[1] These are two appeals, heard at the same time and under common evidence, by Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger each from an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) under section 160 of the Income Tax Act [1] in respect of the dividends received by each of them, during the relevant period, from Graycove Developments Inc. (Corporation). According to each Notice of assessment dated October 18, 2017 (Assessment\/Assessments), the Corporation owed then a total debt to the Crown in an amount of no less than $245,398 for the Corporation\u2019s 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years. The amounts of alleged corporate liabilities on which the Minister has assessed Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger include interest that the Minister accrued on the Corporation\u2019s relevant assessments until October 18, 2017.\nII. Facts and Assumptions of Facts\n[2] At all relevant times, Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger were each 50% shareholders in the Corporation, and they were the only officers and directors of the Corporation.\n[3] The Corporation\u2019s financial statements for the financial years ending the last day of February of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were all finalized around September 10-13, 2013. All Corporation\u2019s corresponding income tax returns were filed in the following weeks, and were ultimately assessed on October 8, 2013 by the Minister. The Corporation\u2019s income tax return for the taxation year ending February 28, 2014, and showing a loss, was ultimately filed after January 5, 2016. The Corporation\u2019s loss of the 2014 taxation year was subsequently carried back to its 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years.\n[4] Each of Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger received annual dividends from the Corporation. During the Corporation\u2019s 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 financial years, the Corporation declared and paid to each shareholder a dividend of $107,500, $113,000, $113,250 and $65,500, respectively.\n[5] The Reply states that the Minister made the following assumptions of fact in assessing liability of the Appellants:\nA.Each Appellant is a shareholder of the Corporation, and the Appellants held the Corporation jointly;\nB.the Corporation had a February 28 year end;\nC.the Corporation paid each Appellant dividends as follows:\nEnding Taxation Year\nDividend\n2010\n$107,500\n2011\n$113,000\n2012\n$113,250\n2013\n$65,500\nD.no consideration was given by the Appellants to the Corporation in exchange for the dividends;\nE.the Corporation owed amounts under the ITA as follows:\nAssessment Date\nCorporation Tax Year\nTax\nPenalty\nInterest\nTotal\nApril 20, 2017\n2013\n$8,291.00\n$3,517.98\n$7,869.57\n$19,678.55\nApril 20, 2017\n2012\n$5,781.00\n$3,908.98\n$4,272.34\n$13,962.32\nFebruary 5, 2016\n2011\n$0.00\n$4,077.11\n$9,556.02\n$13,633.13\nOctober 28, 2014\n2010\n$114,006.62\n$20,936.01\n$63,181.55\n$198,124.18\nTOTAL\n$128,078.62\n$32,440.08\n$84,879.48\n$245,398.18\nF.the Corporation incurred a loss in its 2014 taxation year, which was carried back to reduce Part I tax in 2011 and 2012 to nil and to $5,884 in 2013. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s provincial tax liability was reduced to nil in 2011 and 2012 and to $2,407 in 2013.\nIII. Issue in Dispute\n[6] The issue under appeal is whether the Minister correctly assessed the Appellants under section 160 ITA.\nIV. Position of the Parties\n[7] The Appellants submit that they should not be held liable for the Corporation\u2019s failure to pay the income tax owed to the Minister.\n[8] The position of the Appellants is twofold. First, the underlying Corporation\u2019s reassessments are too high, that on consideration of the economic reality of the taxpayers' income in the years concerned, there ought not to have been, regardless of the reassessments, a liability for which the Appellants were liable. Second, in respect of the Assessments, the Appellants submit, recognizing the long line of authority that what the nature of consideration is, that it may be time to revisit whether or not the taxpayers were ceded dividends in the absence of the payment of any salary, was a consideration that was a gratuitous transfer.\n[9] The Respondent argues that the Minister correctly assessed the Appellants pursuant to section 160 ITA for $245,398. Each Appellant, as shareholders, received dividends from the Corporation totalling $399,250 during the relevant period. The Appellants gave no consideration to the Corporation in exchange for the dividends. At the time each annual dividend was paid, the Corporation had liability arising under the ITA in respect of the relevant period totalling at least $245,398 for its 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years. Considering the annual tax liability incurred by the Corporation in each given year in the relevant period at the time the annual dividend was paid and the amount of the corresponding dividend paid to the Appellants each such year, the Appellants are liable under section 160 for $245,398, being the lesser of the Corporation\u2019s debt and the amount of the dividends paid.\n[10] In Manna [2], Justice Lafleur discussed who bears the burden of showing that the underlying assessments are incorrect. In short, the general rule is that a taxpayer bears the onus of establishing that an assessment or reassessment is incorrect, subject to an exception where the facts concerning the underlying assessments are exclusively within the knowledge of the Minister, the onus will then be shifted to the Minister to show the correctness of the underlying assessment. She wrote:\n[30] For the following reasons, I am of the view that the Appellant bears the burden of showing that the underlying assessments were incorrect.\n\u2026\n[32] As indicated very recently by Justice D\u2019Auray in Monsell v The Queen, 2019 TCC 5, [2019] T.C.J. No. 19 (QL), the general rule is that a taxpayer \u201cbears the onus of establishing that an assessment or reassessment is incorrect\u201d (para. 22). As an exception to that general rule, where the facts concerning the underlying assessments are exclusively within the knowledge of the Minister, the onus will then be shifted to the Minister to show the correctness of the underlying assessment. Justice Paris summarized the applicable principle in Mignardi v The Queen, 2013 TCC 67, [2013] T.C.J. No. 66 (QL) (para. 41), as follows:\n[41] I return now to the proposition that appears to flow from the Gestion Yvan Drouin Inc. case that the Minister bears the onus to prove the underlying tax liability in every appeal from a derivative liability assessment under subsection 160(1) or section 227.1 of the ITA or sections 323 or 325 of the ETA. I agree with respondent\u2019s counsel that such a conclusion is inconsistent with the decisions of the Supreme Court and Federal Court of Appeal to which I have referred. It is only where the facts concerning the underlying tax debt are exclusively or peculiarly within the knowledge of the Minister that the burden will be shifted. Each case will turn on its own facts. Although there may be situations where the tax liability of the original tax debtor is something that is solely within the knowledge of the Crown, more often a taxpayer will have access to that information from the original tax debtor. It should be recalled that one of the bases on which a person is assessed under those provisions is his or her relationship with the tax debtor, either as in this case as a director of the debtor corporation or as a party not dealing at arm\u2019s length with the tax debtor. As a result of this relationship, a taxpayer may very well already have or be able to obtain the information required to verify the existence or amount of the underlying liability.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[Emphasis in original.]\n[11] The Corporation was originally assessed the tax under the ITA as filed, and subsequently reassessed following objections filed. The reasons raised by the Appellants for reconsidering the Corporation\u2019s reassessments under the ITA are closely linked to the position adopted by the Corporation itself when filing its income tax returns. Such situation is clearly not exclusively or peculiarly within the knowledge of the Minister. Therefore, the burden will remain with the Appellants to show that the underlying reassessments were, on the balance of probabilities, incorrect.\nV. Evidence\n[12] Counsel for the Appellants called Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger as witnesses. The Appellants did not call any other witness to testify or support their position. The Respondent called Ms. Zita Parry. Ms. Parry was the agent at the Appeals Division at the relevant time dealing with the Corporation\u2019s objections.\n[13] Mrs. Schonberger\u2019s testimony was short. She described her occupation as a housewife. She has no training in tax or accounting. Her involvement with the Corporation was essentially helping with the decorations and choosing the colour for the model homes, fabrics, etc. Otherwise, Mrs. Schonberger took care of the family and their home in order to enable Mr. Schonberger to devote all his time to their businesses. Mrs. Schonberger did not give the impression of someone being aware of details or even general information regarding the administration or financial aspects of the Corporation.\n[14] Mrs. Schonberger never met the Corporation\u2019s accountants or the bookkeeper, and admitted to not having much knowledge about the financial situation of the Corporation. Her knowledge about the dividends paid by the Corporation is virtually non-existent.\n[15] Her cross-examination was also short. She confirmed being a 50% shareholder in the Corporation, and agreed to having received dividends from the Corporation in 2010 through 2013 but cannot confirm with certainty the amounts received. Mrs. Schonberger confirmed to never being involved with numbers. She confirmed that the information provided by Mr. Schonberger is correct. She saw Mr. Gerry Hood, the bookkeeper at Mr. Schonberger\u2019s office but never met with him.\n[16] Mr. Schonberger\u2019s testimony was longer. He has been in the construction business for about 40 years, and built over 300 houses and other constructions. It was his own business. He has been retired for the last six or seven years. Mrs. and Mr. Schonberger have been married for over 48 years now.\n[17] Mr. Schonberger confirmed that the Corporation was in the business of developing land, building houses, and selling them. He was approving everything from financing, trading, purchasing to selling and invoicing. He was a director, the president and secretary of the Corporation. For all his affairs, he did not take business trainings:\nA. It was strictly construction. I didn't take business training. It was -- I always had a head for business, but I didn't take a course with accounting or management or anything. It was just strictly related to construction, how to build a house, trusses and other things that are related to the actual building of a house.\n[18] And for the business\u2019s bookkeeping and accounting, Mr. Schonberger added:\nI know nothing about accounting. I had a bookkeeper who did all -- using QuickBooks, did all the journal entries. He prepared all the cheques. I approved all the invoices. Once I approved the invoices he would enter them, and he would pay them as was required. He -- once I approved the invoices he would prepare the cheques, and I would sign the cheques, and my receptionist would send the cheques out. I had no idea, you know -- I don't even know how to use QuickBooks. I never used it. I relied solely on my bookkeeper.\n[19] The Corporation\u2019s bookkeeper was with Mr. Schonberger for about 10 years, but not anymore. He believes the bookkeeper might be leaving in Peterborough.\n[20] Once the bookkeeper prepared all the books and accountant entries for the Corporation\u2019s operations, Mr. Schonberger met with his accounting firm for financial statements and income tax returns:\n\u2026 and he would prepare -- he would prepare the tax receipt, the tax returns. I would go to his office and he would tell me, 'Sign here,' and I would sign -- I would sign, and he would send it.\n[21] Mr. Schonberger then went through some pages of Tab 11 of the Appellants\u2019 Book of Documents. This tab relates to the Corporation\u2019s journal entries in the General Ledger including about suppliers having charged the Corporation for services or goods. He gave some additional facts to describe each construction project mentioned in the General Ledger. But such information was high level, and as for numbers and specific accounts and entries under each project listed nothing specific was explained or confirmed. And, this part of Mr. Schonberger\u2019s testimony did not last long, just for a few questions essentially repeating the numbers requested by counsel. No explanation behind the Corporation\u2019s financial situation or accounting entries was provided except for confirming that the Corporation did not pay some suppliers. No mention about the suppliers\u2019 position was raised or addressed.\n[22] Mr. Schonberger then went on to identify a list of suppliers that he remembered as he did not remember them all. He was asked to move to Tab 12 of the Appellants\u2019 Book of Documents. It was confirmed that this document was not prepared by Mr. Schonberger. Again, no mention about the suppliers\u2019 position was raised or addressed.\n[23] The Court understands that Tab 12 contained a list of accounts payable organized under each name\u2019s project with suppliers\u2019 names under each project. Mr. Schonberger has been asked to describe the skills of each supplier. Only a few were omitted most of the time because the supplier was too small.\n[24] Details about numbers or the particular situation of each supplier were not discussed, just general reference to the fact that the accounts were not paid by the Corporation over the years. As to how these accounts were treated in the Corporation\u2019s accounting records, Mr. Schonberger said:\nThey showed up as accounts payable for years and years and years, 'til Gerry told me that by law I have to -- I can't carry it further, so, you know, after a certain period of time I have to take it into income. So again, knowing nothing about account, I said, 'Gerry, do what you have to do.' And he -- I guess he prepared it, took it into income, and he passed it on to the accountant, and the accountant filed it.\n[25] And as to whether he approved the financial statements of the Corporation, Mr. Schonberger added:\nTruth be told, I relied strictly on my bookkeeper, my accountant. I'm not well versed in accounting, and I -- you know, you're only as good as the people you have, and I had them for 40 years and never had a problem, and I relied on them, and when the accountant told me, 'This is your return,' you know, I signed it and he sent it in. I didn't -- I didn't question anything he said. I strictly -- I relied -- I've known -- I've known them for 40 years. I strictly relied on everything they told me.\n[26] Now turned to Tab 2 of the Appellants\u2019 Book of Documents dealing with financial statements of the Corporation, Mr. Schonberger confirmed that he did not know why the Corporation\u2019s 2010 financial statements were prepared more than 3 years after the Corporation\u2019s February 28, 2010 financial year.\n[27] Mr. Schonberger went through the same exercise he did with the 2010 financial statements with the financial statements as at February 28, 2011, 2012 and 2013, where the witness was asked to confirm the Notice to Reader, the date the statements were prepared, name of the accounting firm, cash, advances to related parties, numbers for liabilities, revenues, expenses, income before taxes, income taxes payable, dividends paid.\n[28] The Court notes that all answers from Mr. Schonberger were essentially to confirm the number that appears in the financial statements. In other words, the witness did not provide information supporting the reasons why these numbers were what they appeared to be. The Court understands from the witness\u2019s testimony that it was his advisors\u2019 responsibility.\n[29] Mr. Schonberger confirmed (i) the contact person for the 2014 income tax return was his bookkeeper and (ii) a few numbers in Schedule 100 numbers (Balance sheet information), in the Corporate Taxpayer Summary. Again, the witness basically only confirmed numbers on various lines without providing further explanations or background.\n[30] Mr. Schonberger finally explained how he and his spouse were ultimately paid dividends:\nI didn't take a salary. I didn't take a cheque. I would take draws as I needed money to live, and whatever I took -- whatever I took at the end of the year, I went to the accountant -- Gerry put the figure together, and the accountant would allocate it to me as a dividend, what I took in a year.\n[31] Mr. Schonberger\u2019s cross-examination confirmed the Appellants being the sole shareholders of the Corporation 50-50, and the declaration and payment of dividends from the Corporation to the Appellants in each of 2010 through 2013 taxation years. Mr. Schonberger admitted that:\nthe accounts payable were to be included in the Corporation\u2019s income and that advice can from his bookkeeper. He did not question this advice with his bookkeeper or his accountants; and\nthe Corporation did not have the assets to cover the debt owed to the Minister.\n[32] About the moment the CRA assessed the Appellants for the Corporation\u2019s unpaid debt, Mr. Schonberger answered:\nI didn't think that I was liable, because since I didn't draw a salary, to me it looked like I was being compensated for my work by the -- and he gave it to me as a dividend, so in my wildest dream I didn't think that I'd be liable for a corporation taxes. I looked at it as payment for my work.\n[33] The testimony of Ms. Parry as Appeals officer confirmed that the Minister following the objections filed by the Corporation for its 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years made adjustments on the Corporation\u2019s 2010, 2011 and 2013 taxation years to reduce the overstated debts by the amount of the two accounts receivable from Forest Trim and Trillium Masonry Group. According to her, the exercise did not require any adjustments for the 2012 taxation year. She explained making these adjustments based on the following:\nAs an appeals officer, I am to review the documentation that's set forth in front of me by the taxpayer or in this case the representative, and there was sufficient amount of material -- materiality to adjust those two amounts, those two taxes, to accounts receivable on their tax returns.\n[34] And, as for the possibility to allow any other adjustment in respect of the Corporation\u2019s accounts payable argument, Ms. Parry added \u201cNo, there was no documentation to support any other further adjustments, although it was requested.\u201d\n[35] The agent then was asked about the loss declared by the Corporation in its 2014 income tax return. The loss was recognized and carried back to the 2011 taxation year (third year prior to the 2014 taxation year) as requested by the taxpayer (confirmed by notice of reassessment dated February 5, 2016) but a delay was noticed in applying the remaining of the loss as requested to the Corporation\u2019s 2012 and 2013 taxation years (confirmed by notices of reassessment dated April 20, 2017). Tab 3 and 4 of the Respondent\u2019s Books of Documents confirmed this information.\n[36] During her cross-examination, Ms. Parry was questioned about the result of her work during the objection process and more specifically, whether she reviewed financial statements and amount of accounts payable for the taxation years under objection. In her answers, she referred to rely on filings from the Corporation and on specific amounts raised by the Appellants, and that other amounts were not under review by the Appeals Division. The Court understands from her position that it was not her role to review all information from the taxpayer and to draw conclusions, if such conclusions are not raised at the objection level by the taxpayer to begin with. Her role was not to find the treatment the taxpayer might be entitled to but to address what is specifically requested by the taxpayer at the objection level. She did not challenge the Corporation\u2019s filing returns and information except to review the specifics of the objection only. She also explained on how the Appeals Division was satisfied by the documentation supplied was sufficient to prove that there was an error from the Corporation\u2019s annual filings. She confirmed that at the Appeals Division the taxpayer has to justify on the balance of probabilities that an adjustment is needed to be made. And, that objections are only reviewed on what was requested by the taxpayer. She had a vague recollection about reviewing the Corporation\u2019s 2010, 201, 2012 and 2013 financial statements for purposes of the objection, likely she did it relating to Forest Trim and Trillium Masonry Group as requested by the Corporation and to confirm the adjustments to be made following her review.\n[37] The Appellants\u2019 counsel insisted on the fact that the final reassessments in the file are not included in the Appellants\u2019 or the Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents. The auditor disagreed. She was of the view that the information in Tab 1, Tab 2, Tab 3 and Tab 4 of the Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents reflect the content of the reassessments for 2010 being the last reassessment dated October 28, 2014, for 2011 being the last reassessment dated February 5, 2016, and for 2012 and 2013 being the last reassessments dated April 20, 2017.\nVI. Analysis\n[38] Considering the issue in dispute, the sole relevant provision is subsection 160(1) ITA:\nTax liability re property transferred not at arm\u2019s length\n(1) Where a person has, on or after May 1, 1951, transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to\n(a) the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner,\n(b) a person who was under 18 years of age, or\n(c) a person with whom the person was not dealing at arm\u2019s length,\nthe following rules apply:\n(d) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable to pay a part of the transferor\u2019s tax under this Part for each taxation year equal to the amount by which the tax for the year is greater than it would have been if it were not for the operation of sections 74.1 to 75.1 of this Act and section 74 of the Income Tax Act, chapter 148 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, in respect of any income from, or gain from the disposition of, the property so transferred or property substituted for it, and\n(e) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the property at the time it was transferred exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property, and\n(ii) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this Act (including, for greater certainty, an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this section, regardless of whether the Minister has made an assessment under subsection (2) for that amount) in or in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year,\nbut nothing in this subsection limits the liability of the transferor under any other provision of this Act or of the transferee for the interest that the transferee is liable to pay under this Act on an assessment in respect of the amount that the transferee is liable to pay because of this subsection.\n[39] And, based on the circumstances of this case and the position adopted by the Appellants, the conditions of subsection 160(1) ITA that need to be reviewed in order to dispose of the appeal are the following:\nthe Corporation has transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to a person with whom the Corporation was not dealing at arm\u2019s length.\nIf so, each Appellant and the Corporation are jointly and severally liable to pay under the ITA an amount equal to the lesser of:\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the transferred property at the time of transfer exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property by the Appellant, and\n(ii) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that the Corporation is liable to pay under the ITA (including, for greater certainty, an amount that the Corporation is liable to pay under this section, regardless of whether the Minister has made an assessment under section 160 ITA for that amount) in or in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year.\n[40] The Court does not believe that there is any dispute in this case about whether the Corporation transferred property directly to each Appellant or whether the chronological sequence of dividends is sufficient to cover, as referred to in paragraph 160(1)(e) ITA, the Corporation\u2019s tax liability in or in respect of the taxation year in which the dividend was paid or any preceding taxation year. The lawful declaration of the dividends was not raised. Dividends were declared and paid to the Appellants in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 based on entitlement between the two shareholders, which is 50-50 in this case. [3] And, whether each Appellant deals at arm\u2019s length with the Corporation is clear. Both Appellants, as husband and wife and as the sole shareholders of the Corporation, are not dealing at arm\u2019s length with the Corporation for purposes of the ITA. [4]\n[41] Therefore, the dispute among the parties is whether the Appellants can be found liable under section 160 ITA for any portion of the Corporation\u2019s tax liability for its 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years. On this specific point, the Appellants first argue that the underlying Corporation\u2019s assessments are too high. Second, the Appellants submit, recognizing the long line of authority, that what the nature of consideration is, that it may be time to revisit whether the Appellants were ceded dividends in the absence of the payment of any salary, was consideration that was a gratuitous transfer.\n[42] With respect to the Appellants\u2019 first point, the Court accepts that the Appellants are allowed to legitimately challenge the underlying Corporation\u2019s reassessments for the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years. The Corporation\u2019s action or inaction in this respect does not preclude the Appellants to do so under this appeal. [5] Counsel for the Appellants described the liability of a transferee under section 160 ITA being not the amounts on the face of the underlying assessment but for liability under the ITA. I can accept that, but it cannot be ignored that the way the liability of the transferor is to be challenged is to challenge the underlying assessment itself that reflects the basic amount of the liability under the ITA. In other words, the assessment must be challenged if a taxpayer believes the tax liability under the ITA being incorrect.\n[43] It is worth noting that the Corporation\u2019s income tax filing for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years were late. Income tax returns for all these years were filed after the financial statements for such years were prepared. The financial statements for all four years are dated September 13, 2013. Valid objections against the four initial assessments by notice dated October 8, 2013 were filed by the Corporation on or about January 6, 2014, and representations submitted with respect to the underlying notices of assessment. The Corporation\u2019s position in each notice of objection against each of these years was then that in each year the Corporation\u2019s income (as filed) was overstated by amounts of accounts payable which were included in income and which were not income received in the year.\n[44] The notices of objection were followed by discussions with the Appeals Division and written representations were sent dated September 3, 2014. The Corporation\u2019s representations were essentially referring to a mistake in filing the returns for those years. In other words, the Corporation would have erroneously included in its income accounts payable to its suppliers. These accounts were originally liabilities of the Corporation and should have remained as such for financial and income tax purposes. Note that the financial statements of the Corporation for those years, prepared on the basis of a notice to reader, appear to confirm the filing position applied by the Corporation with respect to accounts payable. More specifically, the accounts payable were considerably reduced in the 2010 financial statements, and this would be consistent with the equivalent income inclusion for that taxation year. Therefore, the incorrect situation as claimed by the Corporation then and the Appellants now originates from the Corporation\u2019s own filing.\n[45] The Corporation\u2019s representations confirmed having obtained from several suppliers a verbal confirmation of the existence of their accounts payable (the representations do not list names or amounts). However, the evidence supports that only two suppliers for a total amount of $107,044.42 confirmed in writing their accounts payable with the Corporation. No more evidence was submitted to support the Corporation\u2019s position. Although of the view that all accounts payable should be reversed, the Corporation concluded that it would be reasonable to resolve the objection by reducing the Corporation\u2019s income by $107,044.42. The Appeals Division accepted by letter dated September30, 2014 that sufficient proof supported a review on that basis. The evidence at the hearing did not support that the Appeals Division was in a position to reasonably conclude that they had been provided evidence to support a different conclusion. On October 28, 2014, the Corporation\u2019s 2010, 2011 and 2013 taxation years were reassessed to reflect the last correspondence from the Appeals Division with respect to the accounts payable accepted. A subsequent reassessment was issued for the 2011 taxation year dated February 5, 2016 to reflect the carry back loss from the 2014 taxation year. And following a subsequent request by the Appellants dated September 27, 2016 for a carry back loss from the Corporation\u2019s 2014 taxation year to the Corporation\u2019s 2012 and 2013 taxation years, the Minister corrected and reassessed these two years by notice dated April 20, 2017 to reflect the loss carried back. These most recent reassessments ended the dispute process engaged by the Corporation. The Court is satisfied that the evidence supports the foregoing.\n[46] Unfortunately, at the hearing, no sufficient tangible evidence from the Appellants was adduced that could allow this result to be changed. After having completed a thorough review of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Court is not convinced that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence introduced by the Appellants allows this Court to draw a conclusion that the underlying reassessments and more specifically the total amount that the Corporation is liable to pay under the ITA for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years, were incorrect. The Appellants referred to the Corporation\u2019s general ledger to support annual variations in accounts payable. Although some confusions appeared with respect to the details supporting the Appellants\u2019 point, the Appellants referred to the economics of the Corporation\u2019s activities to find that such activities ought not to have been taxable income on which the Corporation and the Appellants were assessed. The Court is unable to find in the Appellant\u2019s argument sufficient basis to successfully attack the Corporation\u2019s reassessments.\n[47] The arguments supporting the attack of the underlying reassessments largely rely on general statements only, and the lack of evidence, facts, circumstances, details, information, and corroboration relating to each account payable in each year is notable and significant. References to global annual amounts and impact of variations that such mentioned global amounts may have on the ultimate liability of the Corporation for its 2010-2013 taxation years are insufficient. Providing itemized internal accounting entries in the general ledger without additional evidence, drawing a conclusion from a reference to global amounts such that it would justify that an assessment be modified or considering the economic reality of the taxpayers' income in the years concerned, there ought not to have been a liability for which the taxpayer was liable, cannot in and of itself, satisfy the burden of proof on the taxpayer. As summarized in Mr. Schonberger\u2019s testimony, the substance of the information and statements provided by the sole witness on this issue was insufficient. The Court is of the view that the manner in which the Corporation\u2019s accounting and tax operations, internally and externally, by advisors were carried out, and Mr. Schonberger\u2019s complete acceptance to rely on them, is an important factor explaining how the accounts payable were processed by the Corporation. Mr. Schonberger's lack of knowledge on this issue and capabilities for him to elaborate on this issue before the Court was significant. Unfortunately, the Court has not been convinced.\n[48] It is noteworthy that the Corporation\u2019s accountants having prepared the financial statements and the Corporation\u2019s bookkeeper who was responsible for the Corporation\u2019s accounting entries did not testify. Mr. Schonberger was the only witness who tried to shed light on the circumstances and the numbers on the Corporation\u2019s books. As referred to above in Mr. Schonberger\u2019s testimony, Mr. Schonberger confirmed that he relied on his bookkeeper as to the numbers and accounting issues. He was not able to confirm any accounting entries or explain in any detail the accounting entries that could have been able to support the Appellants\u2019 position. No one testified about the accounting entries that supported the entries in the Corporation\u2019s income tax returns. These entries remain for the most part unexplained and unsupported, and same for the reasons that would support a different tax treatment under the ITA. Moreover, Mr. Schonberger appeared to rely on external advisers as to the Corporation\u2019s tax affairs. Notwithstanding the considerable impact that account payables had on the Appellants\u2019 position, the Court is of the view that no one involved in the treatment of the accounts payable of the Corporation (books, entries, process, analysis, valuation, accounting presentation, etc.) testified. And, although Mr. Schonberger admitted to still having occasional contact with the bookkeeper, and having known him for 15\/20 years, this is unfortunate that Mr. Hood was not called as a witness. The only financial statements that were introduced in evidence for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years were the ones that supported the original tax filings for these years. Restated financial statements were not filed at the hearing.\n[49] The Court considers Tab 11 and Tab 12 of the Appellants\u2019 Book of Documents as background information during Mr. Schonberger\u2019s testimony, and not to prove that additional adjustments are required in addition to what was already reflected in the Corporation\u2019s reassessments under review at the hearing. These tabs were referred to as such, and were not reviewed in detail. In other words, these tabs are not strictly admitted as proof of their content. The Court adds that even if these tabs had been admitted as proof of their content, the Court is not convinced that, on the balance of probabilities, they would support in and of itself, for the reasons described herein, that the Corporation\u2019s reassessments are incorrect and should be modified to reduce the Corporation\u2019s income tax liabilities under the ITA. This is not sufficient to reverse the Appellants\u2019 burden.\n[50] In addition, the assumptions of facts of the Respondent confirmed the Corporation\u2019s liabilities under the ITA and the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 taxation years were reassessed on October 28, 2014 (2010), February 5, 2016 (2011) and April 20, 2017 (2012 and 2013). These reassessments are the final assessments for these taxation years and the Appellants did not succeed in reversing these assumptions.\n[51] The foregoing is fatal to the Appellants\u2019 first point against the Assessments. I do not believe the Appellants, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied their burden.\n[52] As for the second and last point, the Appellants ask the Court to reconsider that the absence of a salary for services performed by them can be a consideration given for dividends for purpose of section 160 ITA. In such a case, no liability would exist to the extent the amount of the dividends declared and paid are no less than the fair market value of the services rendered to the Corporation by the Appellants.\n[53] The Appellants recognize the long line of authority about how the courts have determined that the absence of a salary for services rendered is not consideration for a dividend for purposes of section 160 ITA, and that subsection 160(1) ITA can apply to a dividend paid by a corporation to a shareholder with whom it is not dealing at arm\u2019s length. [6]\n[54] However, the Appellants believe that it might be time to revisit whether the taxpayers were ceded dividends in the absence of the payment of any salary, was consideration that was a transfer for purpose of paragraph 160(1)(e) ITA. The time period to which the Appellants refer is the period associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the reaction of governments to the consequences of the pandemic and the supportive economic measures that were then adopted.\n[55] The Appellants acknowledge that this Court, following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Neuman [7], consistently rejected that view, in Pauz\u00e9 [8], Piuze [9], in Gazaille [10], in C\u00f4te [11], and in Duchaine [12]. The Federal Court of Appeal in Gilbert and most recently in Kufsky [13] also confirmed the same approach.\n[56] In the present case, it was argued that the Appellants also relied on their accountant to determine at the end of the year what advances would be treated by dividend or by salary.\n[57] The Appellants also acknowledge that, in each of the above cases, the courts have viewed the legal nature of entitlement to a dividend and corresponding deprivation to the corporate payor as a reason for determining that there was no consideration payable in respect of the transfer. The Appellants ask this Court to consider what happened in the extraordinary circumstances following the pandemic.\n[58] The Appellants refer to publications in respect of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Business Account loans. In determining entitlement to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the Minister expressly considered what qualifies as income for the purposes of the benefit, and recognized that common-sense approach that amounts paid by a corporation to its owner manager could include non-eligible dividends. The Minister confirms that amounts received are employment or self-employment income.\n[59] The Appellants referred to the Canada Emergency Business Account loans document where they believe the government recognizes the economic reality of small businesses:\nSince its launch, the government has made modifications to CEBA to help even more small businesses, including increasing the payroll eligibility and making CEBA available to owner-operated small businesses that do not have a payroll, sole proprietors receiving business income directly, as well as family-owned corporations remuneration in the form of dividends rather than a payroll.\n[60] The Appellants added that they see in the worst possible time the Government of Canada's recognition that it is a fact that small businesses, that owner managers, remunerate themselves by way of dividend and payroll. The Appellants concluded that, where the question of the corporation's underlying tax liability is a live issue, and the punitive provisions of section 160 ITA are intentionally punitive, if there is room to believe that the economic reality in assessing whether there has been a gratuitous transfer has been recognized by the Government of Canada to be something other than a dividend for which no compensation was received, but to be in fact payment for services rendered by owner managers, should a section 160 liability survive? In the Appellants\u2019 view, it should not.\n[61] The Appellants ask the Court to find that the Government\u2019s recognition is a reason for departing from the long-established case authorities reviewed during the appeal\u2019s hearing, finding that the Neuman decision ends that enquiry.\n[62] The Court notes the Appellants\u2019 invitation. However, the Court does not believe that the reasons submitted by the Appellants are sufficient to reconsider the long-standing position on dividends for purposes of section 160 ITA. In addition, the Court must follow the stare decisis principle. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, the decision of a higher court within the same jurisdiction acts as binding authority on a lower court within that same jurisdiction.\n[63] Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the arguments submitted by the Appellants can be interpreted in such a way that recent propositions from the Government of Canada could be seen as a change of view from the reasoning exposed by the courts to subject dividends to a section 160 assessment. The Court does not see a change of position or policy that could impact the existing wording of section 160 ITA and the interpretation given to it by the courts as of this date. To conclude otherwise would be extending the scope of the words and the context in which they are embedded.\n[64] The Court concludes that, notwithstanding the circumstances that explain how dividends were declared and paid, this is what the Appellants have ultimately accepted and agreed on. A decision was made to accept to receive distribution under a specific mechanism. Different mechanisms may lead to the same final result which is to remit cash to individuals. However, each mechanism has its own legal applicable implication that varies from one to another. All mechanisms are not necessarily available under all circumstances. However, the declaration and payment of a dividend were clearly available to the Appellants as opposed to other mechanisms. This is the choice the Appellants made. The legal consequences must be applied. The decisions listed above have made it clear that dividends do not constitute remuneration and there is an absence of consideration.\n[65] Unfortunately for the Appellants, the second point must also fail.\nVII. Conclusion\n[66] Based on the foregoing, the appeals made in respect of the Notices of assessment dated October 18, 2017, are hereby dismissed, with one set of costs payable by the Appellants to the Respondent.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 31st day of May 2024.\n\u201cJ M Gagnon\u201d\nGagnon J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 82\nCOURT FILES NO.:\n2018-4865(IT)G\n2018-4866(IT)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nHELEN SCHONBERGER v.

Yuan\u201d\nYuan J.\nCitation: 2024 TCC 83\nDate: 20240606\nDocket: 2023-1297(OAS)\nBETWEEN:\nEDDIES L.K. CHAN,\nAppellant,\nand\nTHE MINISTER OF EMPLOYMENT, WORKFORCE\nDEVELOPMENT AND OFFICIAL LANGUAGES,\nRespondent.\nAMENDED REASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nYuan J.\n[1] The Appellant, Mr. Chan, appealed to the Social Security Tribunal (\u201cSST\u201d) pursuant to subsection 28(1) of the Old Age Security Act (\u201cOAS Act\u201d) from a March 2, 2022 reconsideration decision of the Minister of Employment and Social Development (predecessor to the Respondent). The reconsideration decision responds to the Appellant\u2019s request under section 27.1 of the OAS Act for the Minister to reconsider the determination reflected in a letter to the Appellant dated January 28, 2020.\n[2] The Minister\u2019s January 28, 2020 letter concerned the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to monthly guaranteed income supplement (\u201cGIS\u201d) benefits for months within three twelve-month periods \u2013 namely, July 1, 2017 to June 30 2018, July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, and July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 \u2013 having regard for the Appellant\u2019s retirement from employment with Carstar Markham on January 19, 2018. The Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision confirmed the position reflected in the Minister\u2019s January 28, 2020 letter.\n[3] Since one of the grounds (and, in fact, the only ground) of the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST was the correctness of the Minister\u2019s determination of the Appellant\u2019s income or the Appellant\u2019s sources of income for months occurring in the three periods, the SST was required by subsection 28(2) of the OAS Act to initiate a reference to this Court for a decision.\n[4] What follows are the Court\u2019s reasons for decision on the matters associated with the Appellant\u2019s appeal that subsection 28(2) of the OAS Act required the SST to refer to this Court.\nI. BACKGROUND\n[5] The GIS is a monthly non-taxable, monetary supplement that can be received by Canadian-resident individuals who receive Old Age Security pension and have low annual incomes.\n[6] Conceptually, the OAS Act targets the GIS towards low-income individuals by (i) looking at the annual income earned in a recent calendar year, (ii) expressing the income from the prior year as a monthly amount by dividing it by twelve, and (iii) then clawing back the GIS amount payable for a month by one dollar for every two or four dollars of the individual\u2019s monthly income from the prior year, depending on whether the portion of the person\u2019s GIS monthly entitlement is being computed under section 12 or 12.1 of the OAS Act.\n[7] An individual\u2019s GIS entitlement is normally income-tested using his or her income from the full calendar year that precedes the twelve-month period beginning on July 1 of a year that includes the particular month. In the OAS Act, the twelve month period that begins on July 1 of a year and ends on June 30 of the following year is defined as a \u201cpayment period\u201d and the calendar year that immediately precedes a payment period is regarded as the \u201cbase calendar year\u201d in relation that payment period. So, on this basis, an individual\u2019s GIS entitlement is normally income-tested using the person\u2019s annual income for a calendar year that ended between six and 18 months before the month for which his or her GIS entitlement is being computed.\n[8] However, once an individual reaches retirement age and ceases working or carrying on a business, the GIS regime recognizes that it would be inappropriate to have post-retirement GIS benefits income-tested using annual income that was earned in a year throughout which the individual was working. Consequently, the GIS regime has always included special rules that changed the way the claw back is computed for persons who retire, so that the income-testing is based on their reduced monthly income as a retiree. While these special rules initially contemplated only retirement scenarios, they were expanded to include situations where a person would be receiving less pension income than he or she was enjoying in prior years. These special rules are often described as the \u201coption method\u201d, even though they are not described as such in the OAS Act.\n[9] As far as the Appellant and the Minister are concerned, their appeal is about the application of the option method regime as a consequence of the Appellant\u2019s retirement from employment on January 19, 2018 and, more particularly, the extent to which the Appellant\u2019s post-retirement lump sum withdrawals from a registered retirement income fund affected his GIS entitlements for payment periods covered by the applicable option method rules in the GIS regime.\nII. THE OPTION METHOD\n[10] As mentioned earlier, the claw back to a person\u2019s monthly GIS entitlement is based on the individual\u2019s income for the relevant base calendar year. By virtue of the definition of \u201cincome of a person for a calendar year\u201d in section 2 of the OAS Act, that income is computed in accordance with the rules for calculating the income of individuals under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (\u201cITA\u201d) subject to certain express modifications.\n[11] The OAS Act contemplates that, in the usual case (i.e., situations not covered by the option method), an individual would make a new GIS application for each twelve-month payment period and such application would include a statement of the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year in relation to that period. However, as a practical matter, GIS applicants do not submit a statement of income for the base calendar year with their application because income information for the relevant base calendar year is usually available to the Minister before the start of the particular payment period through the applicant\u2019s tax filings with the Canada Revenue Agency.\n[12] Subsections 14(1) and (1.01) are the provisions of the OAS Act that establish the requirement for a GIS applicant to file a statement of income for the base calendar year and the Minister\u2019s authority to waive this requirement where the information is already available to the Minister. And, subsections 14(1.1) and (1.2) of the OAS Act allow the Minister to estimate a person\u2019s income for a base calendar year where the Minister has waived the requirement that the person make a GIS application under subsection 11(3.1) or (4).\n[13] The remaining parts of section 14 of the OAS Act, namely subsections 14(2) to (7), comprise the rules for the option method. Subsections 14(2), (3), and (5) cover situations where an individual has retired from an office or employment or ceased to carry on a business. Subsections 14(4) and (6) cover situations where an individual has stopped receiving income from a pension that was previously providing income. Subsection 14(7) ensures that a person does not receive GIS monthly benefits based on the income computed pursuant to an option method rule before the month that follows the start of retirement from employment or business or reduction of pension income, as the case may be.\n[14] Each of subsections 14(2) to (6) contemplates that the individual who wants the option method applied would provide an estimate of annual income and the Minister would pay GIS benefits for the relevant period with the claw back based on the estimated income thus calculated rather than the annual income for the base calendar year for that payment period.\n[15] There are multiple option method rules for computing estimated income for a payment period because the reduction to an individual\u2019s income due to retirement or reduction\/loss of pension income would normally not have an impact on the GIS claw back for a month until the year of retirement or reduction\/loss of pension income becomes the base calendar year for the payment period in which the month occurs. Having several estimated income formula under the option method addresses the fact that there is a lag of two or more twelve-month payment periods between (i) the year of retirement or reduction\/loss of pension income, and (ii) the start of the first payment period that uses the year of retirement or reduction\/loss of pension income as its base calendar year.\nIII. APPELLANT\u2019S RETIREMENT: ESTIMATED INCOME\n[16] The Appellant retired from employment with Carstar Markham on January 19, 2018.\n[17] The Appellant was eligible under Section 14 of the OAS Act to elect to have the Minister apply three rules under the option method by virtue of his retirement. Each rule applied to a different payment period and allowed the Appellant to provide a statement of estimated income to determine his post-retirement GIS entitlement for the period.\nSubsection 14(2) \u2013 Retirement During Payment Period\n[18] First, subsection 14(2) of the OAS Act allowed the Appellant to provide a statement of estimated income for the 2018 calendar year for use in determining his GIS entitlement for the July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 payment period in which he retired from Carstar Markham, which payment period has the 2016 calendar year as its base calendar year. (Subsection 14(7) applied to ensure that the Appellant only received monthly GIS payments based on estimated income computed in accordance with this rule for the five months in the payment period after his January 19, 2018 retirement.)\n[19] Subsection 14(2) required the Appellant\u2019s estimated income for the year to include (i) any pension income received between February 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 divided by 11 and multiplied by 12, (ii) income from any business or income from any office or employment received in 2018 other than his employment with Carstar Markham, and (iii) his income from the 2016 base calendar year but excluding all pension income, any income from a business, and any income from an office or employment.\nParagraph 14(5)(b) \u2013 Retirement in Prior Payment Period\n[20] Next, paragraph 14(5)(b) of the OAS Act allowed the Appellant to provide a statement of estimated income for the 2018 calendar year for use in determining his GIS entitlement for the July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 payment period, which is the payment period that followed the one in which he retired from Carstar Markham. The July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 payment period has the 2017 calendar year as its base calendar year.\n[21] Paragraph 14(5)(b) required the Appellant\u2019s statement of estimated income for the year to include (i) any pension income received between February 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 divided by 11 and multiplied by 12, (ii) any business income or income from an office or employment received in 2018 other than income from his employment from Carstar Markham, and (iii) his income from the 2017 base calendar year but excluding all pension income, any income from a business, and any income from an office or employment.\nParagraph 14(5)(a) \u2013 First Payment Period Starting After Year of Retirement\n[22] Finally, paragraph 14(5)(a) of the OAS Act allowed the Appellant to provide a statement of estimated income for the 2019 calendar year for use in determining his GIS entitlement for the July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 payment period, which is the payment period that began after the end of the 2018 calendar year in which he retired from Carstar Markham. The July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 payment period has the 2018 calendar year as its base calendar year which, in the Appellant\u2019s case, includes January 2018 employment earnings for the stub period prior to his January 19, 2018 retirement.\n[23] Paragraph 14(5)(a) required the Appellant\u2019s statement of estimated income for the year to include (i) any pension income received in 2019, (ii) any business income or income from an office or employment received in 2019 other than income from his employment with Carstar Markham, and (iii) his income from the 2018 base calendar year but excluding all pension income, any income from a business, and any income from an office or employment.\nPension Income\n[24] As should be evident from the above descriptions of the components for estimated income, pension income received during the relevant calendar year is to be included under each computation.\n[25] Section 14 of the Old Age Security Regulations (\u201cOAS Regulations\u201d) defines the meaning of the expression \u201cpension income\u201d when used in section 14 of the OAS Act, as follows:\nDefinition of Pension Income\n14. For the purposes of section 14 of the Act, \u201cpension income\u201d means the aggregate of amounts received as\n(a) annuity payments;\n(b) alimony and maintenance payments;\n(c) employment insurance benefits;\n(d) disability benefits deriving from a private insurance plan;\n(e) any benefit, other than a death benefit, under the Canada Pension Plan or a provincial pension plan as defined in the Canada Pension Plan;\n(f) superannuation or pension payments, other than a benefit received pursuant to the Act or any similar payment received pursuant to a law of a provincial legislature;\n(g) compensation under a federal or provincial employee\u2019s or worker\u2019s compensation law in respect of any injury, disability or death;\n(h) income assistance benefits under a formal agreement referred to in subsection 33(1) of the Department of Human Resources Development Act by reason of a permanent reduction in the work force as described in that subsection; and\n(i) income assistance benefits under the Plant Workers\u2019 Adjustment Program, the Fisheries Early Retirement Program or the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program by reason of permanent reduction of the workforce.\n[26] The foregoing language establishes an exhaustive (rather than inclusive) definition for \u201cpension income\u201d when applying the option method rules in section 14 of the OAS Act. Also, since the text of Section 14 does not use the expression \u201cor similar payment\u201d as an add-on to any of the enumerated payment types, a payment cannot be included as pension income simply because it shared some characteristics with the expressly enumerated payment types.[1]\nIV. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS\n[27] The dispute between the Appellant and the Minister concerns the treatment of discretionary amounts that the Appellant withdrew from his registered retirement income fund (RRIF) after his January 19, 2018 retirement from Carstar Markham \u2013 the Appellant made lump sum withdrawals from his RRIF of $7,200.84 in 2018 and $7,684.00 in 2019 \u2013 and whether such amounts are pension income for purposes of section 14 of the OAS Act and therefore within the scope of income that the option method rules required him to include when preparing his statements of estimated income.\n[28] The Appellant submitted statements of estimated income for the 2018 calendar year to the Minister for purposes of computing his GIS entitlement under the option method for the period February 2018 to June 2018 (within the July 2017 to June 2018 payment period) and the July 2018 to June 2019 payment period. His statements of 2018 estimated income did not include an anticipated 2018 withdrawal of the $7,200.84 lump sum amount from his RRIF as pension income. The Minister initially accepted the Appellant\u2019s statements of 2018 estimated income for purposes of computing his GIS entitlement for the two periods.\n[29] The Appellant then submitted a statement of estimated income for the 2019 calendar year to the Minister in support of using the option method for purposes of computing his monthly GIS entitlement for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period. His statement of 2019 estimated income did not include an anticipated 2019 withdrawal of the $7,684 lump sum amount from his RRIF as pension income.\n[30] At some point, the Minister learned through the Appellant\u2019s tax filings that he withdrew $7,200.84 as a lump sum from his RRIF in 2018. The Minister then made the determination that the Appellant\u2019s estimated income for 2018 should have included the $7,200.84 payment from his RRIF for purposes of determining his monthly GIS entitlement for the seventeen-month period beginning February 2018 and ending June 2019.\n[31] Based on the Appellant\u2019s representation to the Minister that no RRIF payments would be received in 2019 and to be consistent with the Minister\u2019s overall position that payments from the Appellant\u2019s RRIF are pension income for purposes of the option method rules, the Minister appears to have a made a unilateral decision to apply the option method rule under subsection 14(6) of the OAS Act \u2013 available for situations where a person has suffered a loss\/reduction of pension income from one year to the next \u2013 to make and use a statement of estimated income for the 2019 calendar year. However, after the Minister learned that the Appellant made a further $7,684.00 lump sum withdrawal from his RRIF in 2019, the Minister reversed position on the availability of the subsection 14(6) option method rule because the Minister was now aware that the Appellant\u2019s RRIF payments continued into 2019. The Respondent advised at the hearing that the Minister currently takes the position that the Appellant\u2019s GIS entitlement for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period should be based on a statement of estimated income for the 2019 calendar year computed in accordance with the rules in paragraph 14(5)(a) of the OAS Act and the Appellant was ineligible to use the option method rules under subsection 14(6).\n[32] Based on the parties\u2019 oral submissions at the hearing and materials filed with the Court, the tables below reflect their respective positions on the required components for estimated income for purposes of determining monthly GIS entitlement for payment periods under the applicable option method rules that were available to the Appellant due to his January 19, 2018 retirement from Carstar Markham.\nSubsection 14(2) \u2013 2018 Estimated Income: July 2017 to June 2018 Payment Period\nAppellant\nRespondent\ns. 14(2)(a) \u2013 any pension income received by the person in that part of that [2018] calendar year that is after the month in which the person ceases to hold that office or employment\u2026divided by the number of months in that part of the calendar year and multiplied by 12\n2018 CPP: $6,160.00\n2018 RRIF lump sum: $7,200.84\n2018 CPP: $6,160.00\ns. 14(2)(b) \u2013 the income from any office or employment or any business for that [2018] calendar year other than income from the office, employment or business that has ceased\nNil\nNil\ns. 14(2)(c) \u2013 the person\u2019s income for the [2016] base calendar year calculated as though, for that year, the person had no income from any office or employment or any business and no pension income\nNil\nNil\nTotal 2018 Estimated Income\n$6,160.00\n$13,360.84\nParagraph 14(5)(b) \u2013 2018 Estimated Income: July 2018 to June 2019 Payment Period\nAppellant\nRespondent\ns.14(5)(b)(i) \u2013 any pension income received by the person in that part of that [2018] calendar year that is after the month in which the person ceases to hold that office of employment\u2026divided by the number of months in that part of the calendar year and multiplied by 12\n2018 CPP: $6,160.00\n2018 RRIF lump sum: $7,200.84\n2018 CPP: $6,160.00\ns. 14(5)(b)(ii) \u2013 the income from any office or employment or any business for that [2018] calendar year other than income from the office, employment or business that has ceased\nNil\nNil\ns. 14(5)(b)(iii) \u2013 the person\u2019s income for the [2017] base calendar year calculated as though, for that year, the person had no income from any office or employment or any business and no pension income\n2017 interest income: $12,987.00\n2017 RRSP deduction: $(19,057.00)\n2017 interest income: $12,987.00\n2017 RRSP deduction: $(19,057.00)\nTotal 2018 Estimated Income\n$90.00\n$7,290.84\nParagraph 14(5)(a) \u2013 2019 Estimated Income: July 2019 to June 2020 Payment Period\nAppellant\nRespondent\ns. 14(5)(a)(i) \u2013 any pension income received by the person in that [2019] calendar year\n2019 CPP: $6,302.00\n2019 RRIF lump sum: $7,684.00\n2019 CPP: $6,302.00\ns. 14(5)(a)(ii) \u2013 the income from any office or employment or any business for that calendar year other than income from the office, employment or business that has ceased\nNil\nNil\ns. 14(5)(a)(iii) \u2013 the person\u2019s income for the [2018] base calendar year calculated as though, for that year, the person had no income from any office or employment or any business and no pension income\n2018 RRIF lump sum: $7,200.84\n2018 RRSP deduction: $(13,340.00)\n2018 RRSP deduction: $(13,340.00)\nTotal 2019 Estimated Income\n$162.84\n$646.00\n[33] These tables show how estimated income is impacted by the parties\u2019 respective positions on whether a lump sum withdrawal from an RRIF is pension income under the option method rules. Since the Appellant\u2019s position is that a lump sum RRIF withdrawal is not pension income, the only appearance of a lump sum RRIF withdrawal in the Appellant\u2019s computations of estimated income above is the inclusion of the 2018 withdrawal as part of the income from the 2018 base calendar year under subparagraph 14(5)(a)(iii) when computing estimated income for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period; the Respondent does not include the 2018 RRIF withdrawal among the items in subparagraph 14(5)(a)(iii) because the Minister\u2019s position is that the Appellant\u2019s lump sum RRIF withdrawal is pension income and the language in that subparagraph expressly excludes pension income from the 2018 base calendar year from the amounts to be included in 2019 estimated income.\n[34] It is also to be noted that the Respondent\u2019s positions on the amount to be included in estimated income for the 2018 calendar year pursuant to paragraph 14(2)(a) and subparagraph 14(5)(b)(i) in respect of the 2018 $2,700.84 lump sum payment do not conform with the express wording of those provisions; the words used in those two provisions clearly require that, in the Appellant\u2019s case, any pension income received in 2018 after his retirement is to be divided by 11 months and then multiplied by 12. The Minister\u2019s interpretation that the $7,200.84 lump sum payment is 2018 pension income would correspond to an income inclusion of $7,854.55 (= $7,200.84 x 12 \/ 11) in respect of that item. However, as will be discussed under the next heading, the fact that post-retirement pension income is to be pro-rated in this way under the rules in paragraph 14(2)(a) and subparagraph 14(5)(b)(i) is, in my view, instructive on the issue of whether the option method rules require a lump sum RRIF payment to be included as pension income.\nV. TREATMENT OF LUMP SUM RRIF WITHDRAWALS\n[35] There appears to have been only two prior reported decisions of this Court that have directly considered the question of whether a lump sum payment from an RRIF qualifies as \u201cpension income\u201d for purposes of the option method rules.[2]\n[36] In Ward,[3] the appellant made a discretionary lump sum withdrawal from her RRIF in 2005, which was the base calendar year for the payment period under appeal. She wanted to have access to the option method rules and provide a statement of estimated income for 2006 \u2013 and thereby exclude the 2005 lump sum RRIF payment from the income that would be used to determine the claw back to her GIS entitlement \u2013 on the basis that she suffered a loss\/reduction of pension income in 2006. The Court considered the Minister\u2019s position that, as a category, payments from an RRIF are not pension payments under paragraph (f) of the \u201cpension income\u201d definition in section 14 of the OAS Regulations and then stated, \u201c[w]hile these arguments have merit, they fall short of being compelling in my view.\u201d The Court went on to assume (and counsel for the Minister appeared to concede) that the lump sum RRIF payments were pension income but the Court ultimately dismissed the appeal on the basis that, even assuming that the 2005 lump sum RRIF payment was pension income, the appellant did not suffer a loss\/reduction of pension income in 2006 to allow her to use the option method for that year.\n[37] In L\u00e9vesque,[4] the appellant retired from his employment in September 2011 and sought to have his GIS entitlement for the first six months of the July 2012 to June 2013 payment period determined on the basis of his post-retirement income situation, rather than his income from the 2011 base calendar year, which included pre-retirement employment income. In computing his estimated income for 2012, the Minister included a lump sum withdrawal made from a life income fund (which the Court found to be an arrangement that qualified as a RRIF under the ITA) on the basis that the payment was pension income pursuant to section 14 of the OAS Regulations. In the course of considering whether the lump sum payment could be an \u201cannuity payment\u201d (caught by paragraph (a) of the \u201cpension income\u201d definition) or a \u201csuperannuation or pension payment\u201d (caught by paragraph (f) of the \u201cpension income\u201d definition), the Court stated the following [underlining added]:\n[46] I recognize in certain cases, funds from an RRIF could be considered to be pension income. However, I disagree with the Respondent\u2019s generalization. Whether or not something is a pension income within the meaning of the OAS Act is not determined by the financial vehicle; it is a question of law: do the funds in question constitute an annuity or pension payment? Section 14 of the Regulations was written in a restrictive and comprehensive manner; it was therefore Parliament\u2019s intent to fully define what constitutes pension income within the meaning of section 14 of the OAS Act. For this reason, I believe that a generalization based on the nature of the financial vehicle is risky, even wrong.\n[47] Indeed, as mentioned earlier, in order for funds to constitute an annuity or pension income for the purposes of section 14 of the Regulations, the funds must be paid on a recurring or regular basis. Therefore, if the taxpayer received $1,500 annually from an RRIF, it is my opinion that these funds would constitute an annuity or pension income within the law. However, if the same taxpayer withdrew $15,000 from the same RRIF within a particular taxation year, this withdrawal would not transform the funds into an annuity or pension within the meaning of section 14 of the Regulations, since the withdrawal is not and will never be made on a recurring or regular basis. It is therefore appropriate to consider each case as being unique rather than assuming that a specific financial vehicle will always produce an annuity or a pension.\n[38] The Court went on to conclude that, in the appellant\u2019s circumstances, the lump sum payment from his life income fund was not pension income for purposes of computing his 2012 estimated income under the option method.\n[39] In this reference, the Respondent embraces the observation in L\u00e9vesque that a regular stream of annual payments from an RRIF would cause those payments to be pension income and urges me to apply that same reasoning here to find that the Appellant\u2019s 2018 and 2019 lump sum RRIF withdrawals were both payments that constituted pension income within the meaning of section 14 of the OAS Regulations.\n[40] Factually, the Respondent\u2019s position is based on the notion that, to qualify as an RRIF under the provisions of the ITA and Income Tax Regulations,[5] the terms of an RRIF must provide for annual minimum withdrawals by the annuitant of a prescribed percentage of the fair market value of all properties held in connection with the fund at the end of the year, starting on the calendar year following the one in which the annuitant established the plan. The prescribed percentage begins at just over 5% of the value of the plan\u2019s assets at the end of the year in which he or she turns age 71 and grows each year until topping out at 20% at age 95.\n[41] At the hearing, the Appellant\u2019s representative provided a helpful chart that showed the minimum mandatory amount that the Appellant was required to withdraw under the terms of his RRIF. The chart showed that the lump sum RRIF withdrawals that the Appellant made in 2018 and 2019 correspond to the minimum amount that he was required to receive from his RRIF by statute. The chart also showed that the Appellant continued to make only the minimum mandatory withdrawal from this RRIF in each subsequent year until the present. In short, the chart showed that the Appellant\u2019s pattern of annual taxable receipts from his RRIF over the six-year period from 2018 was not totally dissimilar to what one might expect to see in a six-year window when a person is entitled to benefits under a typical employment-related pension plan.\n[42] Having regard for the purpose underlying the option method regime \u2013 which is to allow an individual\u2019s GIS entitlement to be recomputed for a year solely to take into account income reductions in that year due to retirement or a loss\/reduction of previously enjoyed pension benefits \u2013 it is arguably consistent with that purpose to include the minimum amount that the individual is required to withdraw from the RRIF in the year in accordance with the plan terms when estimating income for the year of retirement or loss\/reduction of pension income. However, for the reasons discussed below, I have concluded that the Appellant\u2019s payments from his RRIF are not pension income, as defined in section 14 of the OAS Regulations.\nDictionary and Other Meanings of the Relevant Terms\n[43] First, as this Court observed in L\u00e9vesque, the definition of \u201cpension income\u201d in section 14 of the OAS Regulations was written to be \u201crestrictive and comprehensive.\u201d As mentioned earlier, it is not enough that a payment shares common characteristics with one or more of the enumerated payment categories for the particular payment to be included in the scope of the \u201cpension income\u201d definition; rather, the payment must have all the indicia that one would expect to identify in an amount that is one of the enumerated \u201cpension income\u201d payment types.\n[44] I note that, while pensions are arrangements that one normally associates with the receipt of benefits following retirement from employment, some of the enumerated payment types in section 14 of the OAS Regulations have nothing to do with employment or retirement whatsoever, such as alimony or maintenance payments or disability benefits and, in the case of annuity payments, there is nothing about an annuity contract that makes it inherently (or even typically) an arrangement that is associated with employment or retirement. This serves to emphasize the point that, for purposes of computing estimated income in section 14 of the OAS Act, the classes of payments that are \u201cpension income\u201d for purposes of section 14 of the OAS Act are entirely a creation of statute and, the question of whether a lump sum payment has the features of a pension is only relevant for determining whether the payment is, in fact, a \u201cpension payment\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (f) of the definition of \u201cpension income\u201d.\n[45] With this framework in mind, there are only two payment categories described in section 14 of the OAS Regulations under which a lump sum withdrawal from an RRIF could possibly qualify: an annuity payment (paragraph 14(a)), and a superannuation or a pension payment (paragraph 14(f)).\n(i) Paragraph 14(a) \u2013 Annuity Payments\n[46] Starting with annuity payments, the term \u201cannuity\u201d is not defined in the OAS Regulations or the OAS Act. While \u201cannuity\u201d is among the definitions in subsection 248(1) of the ITA, the ITA does not purport to exhaustively define the term but rather ensures that its scope \u201cincludes an amount payable on a periodic basis payable at intervals longer or shorter than a year and whether payable under a contract, will or trust or otherwise.\u201d\n[47] However, a canvas of dictionary definitions for the term suggests that an annuity contemplates an arrangement under which periodic payments of a fixed amount are made to the recipient. For example, The Oxford Dictionary of English (3rd edition) defines an annuity as \u201ca fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, typically for the rest of their life. a form or insurance or investment entitling the investor to a series of annual sums.\u201d Similarly, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th edition) provides that an annuity is \u201c[a]n obligation to pay a stated sum, usu. monthly or annually, to a stated recipient\u2026A fixed sum of money payable periodically\u2026A right often acquired under a life-insurance contract, to receive fixed payments periodically for a specific duration.\u201d\n[48] While the mandatory minimum withdrawal requirement under the terms of an RRIF might ensure that the plan\u2019s owner (perhaps, ironically, a person that the ITA defines as the \u201cannuitant\u201d) will receive a stream of annual payments from the plan while there are still assets in the plan, the payment each year is not a fixed amount. Consequently, the mandatory minimum withdrawal requirements of an RRIF do not cause such arrangements to be an annuity and, accordingly, a payment from the RRIF is not within the scope of paragraph (a) of section 14 of the OAS Regulations.\n(ii) Paragraph 14(f) \u2013 Superannuation or Pension Payments\n[49] I now turn to superannuation or pension payments.\n[50] Neither the OAS Act nor the OAS Regulations contain a definition for \u201csuperannuation\u201d.\n[51] There is no definition for \u201cpension\u201d in the OAS Regulations. Section 2 of the OAS Act defines pension as \u201ca monthly pension authorized to be paid under Part I [of the OAS Act]\u201d but, since this provision was obviously included to create a short form reference for pension payable under the OAS Act rather than establishing the scope of arrangements to be considered a pension for purposes of the OAS Act, the section 2 definition is of no assistance for present purposes.\n[52] Dictionary definitions for \u201csuperannuation\u201d suggest that the expression is a synonym for \u201cpension\u201d, or that it is a type of pension. For example, the Oxford Dictionary of English (3rd edition) defines superannuation as \u201cregular payment made into a fund by an employee towards a future pension. a pension of this type paid to a retired person.\u201d\n[53] Dictionary definitions for \u201cpension\u201d are more descriptive and typically reflect the concept that pension benefits are paid upon retirement from working life and often with contributions from the government or a former employer. For example, the Oxford Dictionary of English (3rd edition) defines a pension as \u201c[a] regular payment made by the state to the people of or above the official retirement age and to some widows and disabled people. A regular payment made during a person\u2019s retirement from an investment fund to which that person or their employer has contributed during their working life.\u201d Similarly, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th edition) provides that a pension is \u201c[a] regular series of payments made to a person (or the person\u2019 representatives or beneficiaries) for past services or some type of meritorious work done; esp,. such a series of payments made by the government\u2026 [a] fixed sum paid regularly to a person (or to the person\u2019s beneficiaries), esp. by an employers as a retirement benefit.\u201d\n[54] The term \u201csuperannuation\u201d is not defined in the ITA and, as discussed below, there is an ITA definition of \u201cpension\u201d whose use is restricted to subsection 118(1) of the ITA. Interestingly, the terms \u201csuperannuation\u201d and \u201cpension\u201d appear together as part of a definition in subsection 248(1) of the ITA for \u201csuperannuation and pension benefit\u201d but, like the definition for annuity in the ITA, this definition is not an exhaustive one and is directed at ensuring that its scope include not just benefits but any amount received out of such plans.\n[55] In Abrahamson, 91 TCC 213, this Court had the opportunity to consider the scope of \u201csuperannuation or pension benefits\u201d and whether the expression included an individual\u2019s lump sum withdrawals from an individual retirement account (IRA) established under U.S. law.\n[56] The IRA was a trusteed plan in which the taxpayer and his spouse were the only beneficiaries. It was the vehicle to which the taxpayer transferred his entitlements under a pension plan relating to his former employment in the United States prior to his relocation to Canada in 1975. The taxpayer withdrew a $85,126 lump sum amount from the IRA in 1986 and took the position that the amount was a distribution of capital from an inter vivos trust and, therefore, a non-taxable receipt under the ITA. The Minister reassessed the taxpayer on the basis that the lump sum payment from the IRA was a taxable receipt by virtue of being within the scope of \u201csuperannuation or pension benefits\u201d in subparagraph 56(1)(a)(i) of the ITA.\n[57] In the course of considering the ambit of \u201csuperannuation or pension benefits\u201d, the Court canvassed the English and French dictionary definitions of both expressions and then stated the following [underlining added]:\n[23] Hence, the words \u201csuperannuation or pension benefit\u201d\u2026contemplate a payment of a fixed or determinable allowance paid at regular intervals to a person usually, but not always, as a result of termination of employment for the purpose of providing the person with a minimum means of existence; the formal program for the payment of the specified benefits, or the way the benefits are to be carried out, must be organized or promoted by a person other than the beneficiary since the beneficiary\u2019s right to receive the superannuation or pension benefits is determined by the superannuation or pension plan contemplated by subparagraph 56(1)(a)(i). In other words, the regularity and amount of the payments are made in accordance to the terms of the plan and not at the discretion or direction of the beneficiary.\n[58] The Court first rejected the Minister\u2019s argument that the lump sum payment from the IRA should be regarded as pension benefits because the source of the funds used to establish the IRA was the taxpayer\u2019s entitlements under his pension plan with his former employer. The Court then decided that the lump sum payment from the IRA was not superannuation or pension benefits, as follows [underlining added]:\n[30] The IRA was not a superannuation or pension plan as those words are used in the Act and the amounts received by Abrahamson from an IRA in 1986 were not on account of or in lieu of payment of or in satisfaction of a superannuation or pension benefit. The beneficiary of the IRA may have demanded the balance in his IRA at any time; payments out of the IRA were neither fixed, determinable nor paid at any regular intervals as are pension or superannuation benefits. For a payment to have been made out of an IRA at any particular time was the beneficiary\u2019s decision. The Act does not consider benefits from a RRSP to be superannuation benefits even when property from a pension plan was transferred to the RRSP and neither are benefits from an IRA. The Act deals with pension and superannuation benefits separately from other retirement funds such as a RRSP.\n[59] The Court thus found that an arrangement provides superannuation or pension benefits if it provides for payments that are (i) fixed or determinable, (ii) paid at regular intervals, and (iii) not at the discretion of the beneficiary.\n[60] The indicia for superannuation or pension benefits identified in Abrahamson can be applied to the payments from the Appellant\u2019s RRIF. While the Appellant\u2019s RRIF terms may provide for periodic payments in the form of minimum mandatory withdrawals, the terms do not contemplate payments that are fixed or determinable and, moreover, the Appellant always retained the right to demand payment of the value of the assets under the plan. Consequently, according to the criteria from Abrahamson, the Appellant\u2019s lump sum withdrawals from his RRIF cannot be treated as superannuation or pension benefits under subparagraph 56(1)(a)(i) of the ITA and, similarly, are not superannuation or pension payments under paragraph 14(f) of the OAS Regulations.\nRRIF is a Discrete Income Category in ITA\n[61] Second, having regard for (i) the relationship between the provisions of the OAS Act governing the option method and section 14 of the OAS Regulations, and (ii) the fact that the OAS Act expressly applies the rules under the ITA when computing the claw back of an individual\u2019s GIS entitlement, some meaning should be attached to the fact that, when computing income under the ITA, payments from an RRIF are included pursuant to a specific ITA provision (i.e., paragraph 56(1)(t)), covering those types of payments and that each of the described categories of payments in section 14 of the OAS Regulations have their own ITA provision that clearly applies to that type of payment.\n[62] This was among the arguments that counsel for the Minister advanced in Ward[6] (discussed earlier) that the Court found to have merit but fell short of being compelling. However, as discussed below, my view is that the relationship between the GIS claw back regime and the income computation rules under the ITA makes for a compelling argument against including RRIF payments as a superannuation or pension payment under paragraph 14(f) of the OAS Regulations or any other paragraph of that section.\n[63] The preamble to section 14 of the OAS Regulations restricts the use of that definition to the option method rules in section 14 of the OAS Act. Since implementation of the GIS, the OAS Act has used the rules under the ITA as the basis for measuring an individual\u2019s income when computing the claw back to monthly GIS benefits. Each of the enumerated payment types in section 14 of the OAS Regulation has a clear corresponding ITA provision that requires its inclusion in the computation of income for income tax purposes, as follows\nSection 14 (OAS Regulations) Payment Category\nCorresponding ITA Income Inclusion\n(a) annuity payment\ns. 56(1)(d) or (d.2)\n(b) alimony and maintenance\ns. 56(1)(b)\n(c) employment insurance benefits\ns. 56(1)(v)\n(d) disability benefits deriving from a private insurance plan\ns. 6(1)(f)(iii) if pursuant to employer-paid disability insurance plan, but otherwise non-taxable\n(e) any benefit (other than death benefit) under the Canada Pension Plan\ns. 56(1)(a)(i)(B)\n(f) superannuation or pension payments\ns. 56(1)(a)(i)\n(g) compensation under worker\u2019s compensation law in respect of any injury, disability, or death\ns. 56(1)(v)\n(h) income assistance under a formal agreement referred to in s. 33(1) of the Department of Human Resources Development Act by reason of permanent reduction in the work force\ns. 56(1)(r)(iv)\n(i) income assistance benefits under the Plant Workers\u2019 Adjustment Program, the Fisheries Early Retirement Program or the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program by reason of permanent establishment of the workforce\ns. 56(1)(r)(iv)\n[64] It seems inconceivable that the persons who drafted the pension income definition would not have carefully considered each of the payment types that the ITA enumerates and expressly brings into an individual\u2019s income and then simply selected the types that should be treated as pension income under the option method to suit the objectives of those rules. With that in mind, it speaks volumes that RRIF payments were not expressly included as part of the pension income definition in section 14 of the OAS Regulations, given that paragraph 56(1)(t) is a discrete ITA provision that specifically identifies payments from an RRIF as an amount to be included in computing an individual\u2019s income under the ITA.\n[65] It is also instructive for present purposes to see that the ITA contains a definition of \u201cpension income\u201d in subsection 118(7) for use that is limited to subsection 118(1). That definition is relevant for identifying the categories of taxable receipts that are eligible for the pension credit for individuals under subsection 118(3) and for pension income-splitting between spouses under section 60.03 of the ITA. Under that definition, a payment from a superannuation or pension plan is included under subparagraph (a)(i) whereas payments from an RRIF are a standalone category of receipts that are included under subparagraph (a)(iii) of the definition of \u201cpension income\u201d in subsection 118(7) of the ITA. Consequently, when Parliament wanted to include RRIF payments within the scope of provisions that were designed for sources of income that were treated as pensions under the ITA, it enacted an extended definition to expressly include payments from an RRIF.\n[66] In my view, the foregoing is part of a compelling case for excluding payments from an RRIF from pension income under section 14 of the OAS Regulations on the basis of structure in the ITA, which treats an RRIF as a separate source of income from a pension.\nImplications for Option Method Rules if Lump Sum RRIF Payments are Treated as Pension Income\n[67] Third, the nature of an individual\u2019s rights under his or her RRIF are not very compatible with how the option method rules are intended to operate with respect to pension income, both in regards to (i) the computation of the appropriate amount of pension income to include when computing estimated income, and (ii) evaluating whether the individual has suffered a loss or reduction of pension income.\n[68] With respect to the computation of pension income under the option method rules, some of the scenarios under the option method rules require estimated income to include pension income received during part of a year to be first divided by the number of months in that part of the year and then multiplied by twelve months to produce a notional annual receipt for that source of pension income; paragraph 14(2)(a) and subparagraph 14(5)(b)(i) of the OAS Act identified above are two examples of such a provision. Obviously, the underlying assumption with this type of adjustment is that the pension income received during the relevant period from that source was proportional to the individual\u2019s annual entitlement. However, in the case of an RRIF, the owner has discretion to withdraw as much or as frequently as he or she likes anytime while the RRIF continues to exist. To include a lump sum amount that an owner might withdraw from the RRIF in the relevant period and annualizing it in this manner creates the prospect of distorting the amount of the income that is appropriate to include in computing estimated income, depending on how many months there are in the relevant part\u2011year period. As noted earlier, this is exactly what would happen in the Appellant\u2019s situation if the 2018 lump sum payment was treated as pension income for purposes of the option method rules in subsection 14(2) and paragraph 14(5)(b): the $7,200.84 2018 lump sum payment would have to be annualized to $7,854.55.\n[69] With respect to determining whether an individual has suffered a loss or reduction of pension income, one of the main reasons that specific payment types have been enumerated in the definition of \u201cpension income\u201d in section 14 of the OAS Regulations is to give individuals access to the option method rules in the event that the individual suffers a reduction of income from sources that fit the definition of income under section 14 of the OAS Regulations. The Regulatory Analysis Impact Statement that accompanied the amendments to the OAS Regulations that added paragraphs (h) and (i) to the definition of \u201cpension income\u201d clearly make this point, as those notes indicate that the two categories were added solely to give persons who were receiving income-replacement benefits under certain government programs access to the option method rules when benefits under the programs came to an end.[7]\n[70] As noted earlier, in the case of an RRIF, the owner of the plan has discretion to determine the amount and timing of withdrawals. Consequently, even though there are minimum withdrawal requirements under the terms of the plan, the individual would still have the ability to dictate whether he or she has a reduction of income from that income source from one year to the next. It is contrary to the intentions of the option method rules that an individual would have the ability to dictate whether they have access to the option method rules based on decisions that are within their own discretion. This problem with including RRIF arrangements as a source of pension income for purposes of the option method rules was on full display in the course of the Appellant\u2019s dealings with the Minister on his GIS entitlement for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period, as the Minister initially allowed the Appellant to use the option method rule under subsection 14(6) of the OAS Act but then changed position when the Minister saw that the Appellant would not be suffering a reduction in RRIF income in 2019 compared to 2018 by virtue of receiving a $7,684.00 lump sum from his RRIF in 2019 compared to the $7,200.84 lump sum amount that he received in 2018.[8]\nConclusion on Treatment of Lump Sum RRIF Payments\n[71] For all the reasons outlined above, I have concluded that the 2018 and 2019 lump sum withdrawals from the Appellant\u2019s RRIF are not pension income for purposes of section 14 of the OAS Act and are not to be included when computing the Appellant\u2019s estimated income (i) for the payment period July 2017 to June 2018 (pursuant to subsection 14(2)), (ii) for the payment period July 2018 to June 2019 (pursuant to paragraph 14(5)(b)), and (iii) for the payment period July 2019 to June 2020 (pursuant to paragraph 14(5)(a)). Consequently, the correct amounts for estimated income are the amounts that were computed by the Appellant, as shown in the tables above: 2018 estimated income of $6,160.00 (pursuant to subsection 14(2)), 2018 estimated income of $90.00 (pursuant to paragraph 14(5)(b)), and 2019 estimated income of $164.84 (pursuant to paragraph 14(5)(a)).\nVI. SCOPE OF A SUBSECTION 28(2) REFERENCE TO THE TAX COURT OF CANADA\n[72] The sole issue that the parties addressed in their written and oral submissions for the reference in this Court was the treatment the Appellant\u2019s lump sum RRIF withdrawals when computing the Appellant\u2019s estimated income under the three option method rules the Appellant was eligible to have the Minister apply. As discussed at length above, I have found that the Appellant\u2019s position on that issue was the correct one.\n[73] However, it is not clear to me that my decision on that issue disposes of the income-related matters associated with the Appellant\u2019s appeal that subsection 28(2) of the OAS Act requires this Court to address.\n[74] The context and scope of the reference to this Court as part of the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST is established by the combined effect of sections 27.1 and 28 of the OAS Act, the relevant portions of which provide the following [underlining added]:\n27.1 (1) Request for Reconsideration by Minister \u2013 A person who is dissatisfied with a decision or determination made under this Act that no benefit may be paid to the person, or respecting the amount of a benefit that may be paid to the person may, within ninety days after the day on which the person is notified in writing of the decision or determination, or within any longer period that the Minister may, either before or after the expiration of those ninety days allow, make a request to the Minister in the prescribed form and manner for a reconsideration of that decision or redetermination.\n* * * *\n(2) Decision of Minister \u2013 The Minister shall, without delay after receiving a request referred to in subsection (1)\u2026reconsider the decision or redetermination, as the case may be, and may confirm or vary it and may approve the amount of a benefit or determine that no benefit is payable, and shall without delay notify, in writing, the person who made the request of the Minister\u2019s decision and of the reasons for it.\n28. (1) Appeal \u2013 benefits \u2013 A person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Minister made under section 27.1\u2026may appeal the decision to the Social Security Tribunal\u2026\n(2) Reference as to income \u2013 If, on appeal to the Social Security Tribunal, it is a ground of the appeal that the decision made by the Minister as to the income or income from a particular source or sources of an applicant\u2026was incorrectly made, the appeal on that ground must, in accordance with the regulations, be referred for decision to the Tax Court of Canada, whose decision, subject only to variation by that Court in accordance with any appeal under the Tax Court of Canada Act relevant to he appeal in the Social Security Tribunal, is final and binding for all purposes of the appeal to the Social Security Tribunal except in accordance with the Federal Court Act.\n(3) Stay of benefits pending judicial review \u2013 If a decision is made by the Social Security Tribunal in respect of a benefit, the Minister may stay payment of the benefit under the later of\n(a) the expiration of the period allowed for making an application under the Federal Courts Act for judicial review of the decision, and\n(b) where Her Majesty has made an application under the Federal Courts Act for judicial review of the decision, the month in which all proceedings in relation to the judicial review have been completed.\n[75] A preliminary observation is that an appeal to the SST under section 28 is from a Ministerial decision or determination that no benefit may be paid or concerning the amount of the benefit that may be paid. Also, while the provisions include the Minister\u2019s right under subsection 28(3) to stay the payment of benefits under the OAS Act to permit the Minister to seek judicial review of an unfavourable SST decision, section 28 does not contemplate the suspension of the Minister\u2019s right to recover an overpayment in the event that an individual seeks judicial review of an SST decision that confirms the Minister\u2019s decision or determination establishing an overpayment; this could suggest that an appeal under that section was not intended to deal with disputes concerning the Minister\u2019s determination that there was an overpayment of benefits.\n[76] If it is true that appeals under section 27.1 and 28 of the OAS Act are only available for disputes concerning benefits under the OAS Act that have yet to be paid, then there is the prospect of a jurisdictional issue if an individual seeks to use section 28 of the OAS Act to appeal the Minister\u2019s decision or determination that concerns the computation or recovery of an overpayment of GIS benefits. However, there are many instances of this Court hearing GIS-related references under the OAS Act where the SST accepted jurisdiction to hear an appeal involving a Ministerial decision or determination that created an overpayment.[9] Consequently, for purposes of the reference to this Court as part of the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST, I simply raise this as an issue for the SST but will nonetheless carry on to consider the nature of the income-related questions that are engaged by the Appellant\u2019s appeal.\nNature of the Income-Related Matters in the Appellant\u2019s Appeal to the SST\n[77] The subject of the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST is the Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision dated March 2, 2022.\n[78] The reconsideration decision reflected the Minister\u2019s determination that, for the period February 2018 to June 2019, there was an overpayment to the Appellant of his monthly GIS benefits on the basis of the difference between (i) the amount of GIS benefits that was paid to Appellant based on his statements of estimated income for 2018 which did not anticipate or include a 2018 lump sum withdrawal from the Appellant\u2019s RRIF, and (ii) the Minister\u2019s computation of the Appellant\u2019s GIS benefits for that period under the applicable option method rule based on estimated income for 2108 that included the 2018 lump sum RRIF withdrawal.\n[79] The reconsideration decision also reflected the Minister\u2019s determination that, for the period January 2019 to June 2020, an adjustment to the monthly GIS benefit in favour of the Appellant should be made to allow him to benefit from the option method rules under subsection 14(4) and paragraph 14(6)(b) for the reduction or loss of pension income in 2019.[10] However, even though the Minister knew at the time of issuing the reconsideration decision that the Appellant had made a lump sum withdrawal from his RRIF in 2019, it does not seem that the reconsideration decision reflected any corresponding change in position on the GIS benefits for that period. It is clear though that the Minister later decided the Appellant did not suffer a reduction or loss of pension income in 2019 and, therefore, the Appellant was not entitled to have subsection 14(4) or paragraph 14(6)(b) apply to adjust his monthly GIS benefits for that period. To the extent that the Minister\u2019s change in position would result in a reduction of GIS benefits or the creation of an overpayment for the January 2019 to June 2020 period compared to the amount of GIS benefits for that period allowed under the Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision, this may raise a procedural issue as to whether the Minister would be essentially appealing the Minister\u2019s own determination of any overpayment in respect of the January 2019 to June 2020 period. However, it seems that this is a procedural question for the SST to consider and would not affect this Court\u2019s obligation to come to conclusions on the income-related questions associated with the Minister\u2019s determination or decision on GIS benefits for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period.\n[80] Focusing then on the Minister\u2019s determination that the Appellant received an overpayment, it would appear that there are three income-related questions that are possibly engaged by the Appellant\u2019s appeal of the Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision. One question is the computation of the Appellant\u2019s estimated income under each of the option method rules that the Appellant was entitled the have applied under section 14 of the OAS Act as a consequence of his January 18, 2018 retirement from Carstar Markham. Another question is the Appellant\u2019s income for the base calendar year for purposes of computing his entitlement for monthly GIS benefits under of sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act. Finally, there are income-related questions inherent in the Minister\u2019s determination that the Appellant has received an overpayment of GIS benefits for months in the payment periods involved in his appeal.\nHistory and Interaction of Sections 12 & 12.1, 14, and 18 of the OAS Act\n[81] Before considering the income-related questions engaged by the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST, I will discuss the history and interaction of the sections that have been used in the OAS Act to implement income-testing under the GIS regime to take into account a reduction of income from retirement or from the loss\/reduction of pension income. Those OAS Act provisions are (i) sections 12 and 12.1, which determine the amount of an individual\u2019s monthly GIS benefit including the amount, if any, of the income-based claw back, (ii) subsections 14(2) to (7), which provide a set of rules that allow an individual to make an estimate of income that reflects the loss of employment or business income due to retirement or the loss\/reduction of pension income and should cause the claw back for GIS benefits to be based on sources of income used to make the estimate, and (iii) section 18 of the OAS Act, which creates an adjustment mechanism where the individual\u2019s ultimate GIS entitlement for the period is more or less than the GIS benefits that were previously paid on the basis of the estimate.\n[82] If one accepts that part of the purpose and function of sections 12, 12.1, 14 and 18 of the OAS Act are as described in the preceding paragraph, then how those sections interact with one another should be some version of the following: (i) if an individual is in a situation that allows for GIS benefits to be paid under section 14 on the basis of an estimate, the Minister would pay his or her GIS benefits using the estimate made by the individual, (ii) the sources of income that are required by statute to be included in making the estimate would become the sources of income that would determine the amount of GIS benefits that the individual was ultimately entitled to receive for the period covered by the estimate, and (iii) once the amount of income actually received from the sources used to make the estimate are known, the adjustment mechanism is available to the Minister to ensure that the amount of GIS benefits that the individual received for the period covered by the estimate reflected the actual income earned from the sources that were included in making the estimate.\n[83] Sections 12, 12.1, 14 and 18 (and their predecessor provisions) of the OAS Act have mostly interacted with one another in this way since the start of the GIS regime. However, as will be discussed below, section 14 of the OAS Act was amended in 2007 such that an individual\u2019s request to have the Minister compute and pay GIS benefits on the basis of an estimate no longer affected the annual income that was being used to compute the individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS benefits (under sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act) for the period covered by the estimate.\n[84] Sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act together establish the aggregate amount of an individual\u2019s entitlement to monthly GIS benefits. Both sections set the maximum amount that an individual can receive under that section as GIS benefits for a month and then apply a claw back particular to each individual based on his or her income for the base calendar year in relation to the month for which the benefit is being computed. In the case of section 12, the claw back is based on the individual\u2019s \u201cmonthly base income\u201d which is defined in subsection 12(6) as one-twelfth of the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year. Section 12.1 does not use the concept of monthly base income but nonetheless reduces an individual\u2019s entitlement to additional GIS benefits that are payable under that section by implementing a claw back in the formula in subsection 12.1(1) which uses the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year. Accordingly, in the case of both section 12 and 12.1, the individual\u2019s income for a base calendar year is used to determine the extent of the individual\u2019s claw back from the maximum GIS benefit that is payable to the individual under each of the two sections.\n[85] One would expect that the claw back under sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act would be computed differently when an individual elected for one of the option method rules in section 14 and, indeed, this was the case until section 14 was amended in 2007. Previously, subsections 14(2) and (4), and paragraphs 14(5)(b), and (6)(b) each expressly modified how the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year was to be calculated, and subsection 14(3), and paragraphs 14(5)(a) and (6)(a) of the OAS Act each deemed the individual\u2019s income computed in accordance with the applicable option method rule to be the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year. This version of the option method rules was enacted in 1998[11] and replaced a version of section 14 that deemed the estimated income to be the \u201cincome for the base calendar year\u201d under every scenario in which an individual was permitted to provide an estimate of income under that section. If one looks through the history of amendments to section 14 and its predecessor provisions, it can be seen that the deeming of the individual\u2019s estimated income to be income from the base calendar year or the deeming of the income from a source used to make the estimate to be the amount of income from that source when computing income for the base calendar year can be traced back to the start of the GIS regime when it was introduced in 1966.[12]\n[86] As previously noted, section 14 of the OAS Act was amended in 2007 (with effect from July 1, 2008) for the purpose of simplifying the computation of an individual\u2019s estimated income under the option method rules.[13] But the package of amendments to the option method rules also removed the language in prior versions of subsections 14(2) to (6) that connected the computation of income under those rules to the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year in relation to the payment period for which the estimate was being applied. Accordingly, it would seem that post-amendment, even where an individual opted to provide an estimate of income under one of the option method rules in section 14, the amount of an individual\u2019s GIS entitlement under sections 12 and 12.1 for the payment period covered by the estimate would continue to be computed on the basis of the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year in relation to the payment periods covered by the estimate. In other words, the election to have an option method rule apply no longer automatically adjusted the individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS benefits for the payment period that was supposed to be governed by the estimate.\n[87] Parliament\u2019s motivations for removing the link between estimated income and income from the base calendar year in section 14 are unclear. The change could have been directed at addressing a concern that deeming estimated income to be income from the base calendar year or otherwise dictating how income from a base calendar year would be computed would, as a matter of statutory construction, preclude the Minister from recovering an overpayment under section 18, since it could be argued that estimated income would always be equal to actual income (i.e., income from the relevant base calendar year). However, the 2007 amendment also implemented a change to the nature of the operative language for the option method rules from earlier versions; previously, subsections 14(2) to (6) each identified the circumstances that would allow an individual to provide a statement of estimated income and the balance of the text was directed at determining how income from the base calendar year would be computed in light of the individual\u2019s election to use an estimate of income. Following the 2007 amendments, there are no longer any references to \u201cincome for the base calendar year\u201d in subsections 14(2) to (6). Currently, the text in those provisions mostly cover how estimated income should be computed. To me, what this suggests is that, in the course of considering how section 14 might be revised to simplify the concept of estimated income for purposes of the option method rules, the persons responsible for drafting the amendments lost sight of the fact that a key role played by the pre-2007 version of subsections 14(2) to (6) was to replace what would otherwise be the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar year for the relevant payment period with an income computation that reflected the individual\u2019s reduction in income due to retirement or reduction\/loss of pension income. Whatever Parliament\u2019s reasons for making those amendments, the changes to the operative language and the removal of references to income for the base calendar year were done repeatedly (i.e., in each of the option method rules) and one can only assume deliberately, even if the impact of those changes was not fully appreciated at the time.\n[88] As mentioned earlier, section 18 of the OAS Act contains the adjustment mechanism for determining whether the GIS benefits that were previously paid to an individual exceed his or her ultimate entitlement for a particular month.\n[89] Currently, section 18 of the OAS Act provides, as follows [underlining added]:\n18. Adjustment of payments of supplements \u2013 Where it is determined that the income for a base calendar year (in this section referred to as the \u201cactual income\u201d) of an applicant for a supplement does not accord with the income of the applicant (in this section referred to as \u201cshown income\u201d) calculated on the basis of a statement or an estimate made under section 14, the following adjustments shall be made:\n(a) if the actual income exceeds the shown income, any amount by which the supplement paid to the applicant for months in the payment period exceeds the supplement that would have been paid to the applicant for those months if the shown income had been equal to the actual income shall be deducted and retained out of any subsequent payments of supplement or pension made to the applicant, in any manner that may be prescribed; and\n(b) if the shown income exceeds the actual income, there shall be paid to the applicant the amount by which the supplement that would have been paid to the applicant for the months in the payment period if the actual income had been equal to the shown income exceeds the supplement paid to the applicant in those months.\n[90] The nature of section 18 is the following: if the preamble requirement of \u201cactual income\u201d being different from \u201cshown income\u201d \u2013 which is the income or estimated income on which GIS benefits were previously paid \u2013 is met, then there is to be a retroactive adjustment to an applicant\u2019s GIS entitlements for the prior periods under either paragraph 18(a) or (b), depending on whether there was an overpayment or a shortfall.\n[91] I will be discussing the current version of section 18 of the OAS Act in greater detail later in these reasons (in the context of the determinations that this Court is required to make as part of this reference). However, it will be useful at this point to look at a previous version of the preamble to section 18 because it underscores the idea that the option method rules, the adjustment mechanism, and the entitlement sections were intended to work together.\n[92] Previously, \u201cactual income\u201d in the section 18 preamble meant \u201cincome from a base calendar year, calculated as required by this Part [II \u2013 Monthly Guaranteed Income Supplement]\u201d, as follows [underlining added]:[14]\n18. Adjustment of payments of supplements \u2013 Where is determined that the income for a base calendar year, calculated as required by this Part (in this section referred to as the \u201cactual income\u201d), of an applicant for a supplement does not accord with the income of the applicant (in this section referred to as the \u201cshown income\u201d) calculated as required by this Part on the basis of a statement or an estimate made under section 14, the following adjustments shall be made:\n[93] Even this earlier version of the section 18 preamble does not make an express link between actual income and any rules in section 14 relating to income from a base calendar year. But, this version of the preamble clearly acknowledges that income from the base calendar year may be subject to adjustment under provisions within the part of the OAS Act that deals with the GIS, such as pre-2007 versions of subsections 14(2) to (6) when they were still law. This type of language in the preamble to section 18 can be traced back to the predecessor provision that was enacted as section 15 of the OAS Act at the start of the GIS regime when it was introduced in 1966.[15]\n[94] I have taken the time to go over the interaction and relevant legislative history of the OAS Act sections that have traditionally been part of the implementation of the GIS option method to show how I came to the unavoidable conclusion that, as a consequence of the 2007 amendments to subsection 14(2) to (6) of the OAS Act, the relevant sections of the OAS Act have ceased to work properly, at least from a technical statutory construction perspective, for delivering the intended benefit of causing an individual\u2019s ultimate GIS entitlement to be determined on the basis of the timing and sources of income that were used to make the estimate under subsections 14(2) to (6) of the OAS Act.\n[95] I will now carry on to discuss the income-related questions that are engaged by the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST, having regard for the fact that the words used in the OAS Act for implementing the option method do not, on their face, seem to adjust an individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS benefits where he or she made an estimate of income pursuant to subsections 14(2) to (6).\nIncome-Related Question \u2013 Section 14 of the OAS Act\n[96] The first income-related question is the one the parties identified themselves and that has been the subject of the dispute between the Minister and the Appellant from the outset: the amount of the Appellant\u2019s estimated income in accordance with subsection 14(2), paragraphs 14(5)(a), and 14(5)(b) of the OAS Act.\n[97] As discussed earlier, the finding of this Court is that the Appellant\u2019s estimated incomes under subsection 14(2) for the July 2017 to June 2018 payment period, paragraph 14(5)(b) for the July 2018 to June 2019 payment period, and paragraph 14(5)(a) for the July 2019 to June 2020 payment period are $6,160.00 for 2018, $90.00 for 2018, and $162.84 for 2019, respectively.\n[98] However, I pause here to observe that, where GIS benefits have already been paid on the basis of a statement of estimated income furnished by the individual and the Ministerial determination under appeal concerns an overpayment arising under section 18, it seems to me that the correctness of the computation of estimated income at the time the GIS benefits were previously paid should be largely irrelevant to the Minister\u2019s determination under that section. This is because the amount of the upward or downward adjustment under paragraphs 18(a) and (b) simply starts with the amount of GIS benefits that were previously paid, irrespective of how estimated income was computed at that time, and compares that amount with what the GIS benefits would have been if the individual\u2019s income was the amount of \u201cactual income\u201d, which is defined as income of a base calendar year in relation to the previously paid GIS and, as discussed earlier, the language currently used in the OAS Act does not reflect a relationship between (i) estimated income computed in accordance with an option method rule in section 14, and (ii) income from a base calendar year under sections 12, 12.1 or 18.\n[99] My closing thought on this topic is that, when the pre-2007 versions of section 14 were still in force, the option method provisions in that section would have been clearly relevant to the determination of actual income under section 18 because actual income is simply income from the base calendar year and the pre\u20112007 text contained language that specifically directed how income from a base calendar year would be computed in circumstances where section 14 allowed estimated income to be used.\nIncome-Related Question \u2013 Subsections 12(6) and 12.1(1) of the OAS Act\n[100] If the nature of the Minister\u2019s determination under appeal by the Appellant is the individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS benefits from the payment periods covered by the determination, sections 12 and 12.1 seem to be the only OAS Act provisions that fix the amount of GIS benefits that an individual is entitled to receive for a month in a payment period.\n[101] As discussed earlier, there are income-related questions that arise under sections 12 and 12.1 in connection with the claw back mechanism used to implement income-testing for the GIS. The claw back in each section uses \u201cincome from the base calendar\u201d in relation to a payment period; as previously noted, the concept of \u201cestimated income\u201d is nowhere to be found in those two sections.\n[102] This issue concerning an individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS benefits under section 12 for a payment period for which the individual has elected to use the option method was raised by this Court in Moskal, 2010 TCC 5, as follows:\n[18] The respondent suggest that paragraph 14(6)(a) permits an alternative method for computing income for purposes of section 12. On its face, paragraph 14(6)(a) does not clearly override the requirement to use income for the base calendar year, but the respondent\u2019s position is favourable to Mr. Moskal and therefore I will accept it.\n[103] Moskal involved the current version of paragraph 14(6)(a) of the OAS Act. The Court did contrast the language used in the current and pre-2007 amendment versions of paragraph 14(6)(a) with respect to how income was computed under each version but did not attach any significance to the removal of references to income from the base calendar year from post-2007 version of that provision. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to consider this to be a case which held that an election to provide an estimate under one of the option method rules under the current version of section 14 displaces the requirement to use income for the base calendar year under section 12 of the OAS Act.\n[104] At the hearing of this reference, the parties agreed that, for purposes of the OAS Act, the Appellant\u2019s incomes for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 calendar years computed in accordance with section 2 of the OAS Act were, as follows:\n2016\n2017\n2018\nCPP - $5,813.00\nEmployment - $51,096.00\nCPP - $6,069.00\nInterest - $12,987.00\nEmployment - $42,395.00\nRRSP deduction \u2013 $(19,057.00)\nCPP - $6,160.00\nRRIF - $7,200.84\nEmployment - $4,097.00\nRRSP deduction - $(13,340.00)\n$56,909.00\n$42,394.00\n$4,117.84\n[105] Based on the parties\u2019 agreement, this Court finds, for purposes of determining the amount of GIS benefits that may be paid to the Appellant pursuant to sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act for the periods covered by the Minister\u2019s March 2, 2020 reconsideration decision, as follows: (i) for months in the payment period June 2017 to July 2018, income for the base calendar year is the $56,909.00 income for the 2016 calendar year, (ii) for months in the payment period June 2018 to July 2019, income for the base calendar year is the $42,394.00 income for the 2017 calendar year, and (iii) for months in the payment period July 2019 to June 2020, income for the base calendar year is the $4,117.84 income for the 2018 calendar year.\n[106] My findings on the question under this heading obviously run counter to the clear and obvious purpose for making the option method rules available to individuals in the situations covered by subsections 14(2) to (6) of the OAS Act. But, I am unable to come to a different conclusion in light of the fact that the 2007 amendments intentionally and systematically deleted the many instances of language in former section 14 that would have applied to avoid this result. Moreover, as I have previously noted, it is not clear to me that the amount of an individual\u2019s ultimate entitlement to GIS for a period under sections 12 and 12.1 are actually relevant in the context of the Appellant\u2019s appeal to the SST, since the Minister has already paid GIS benefits to the Appellant for the payment periods contemplated by the Minister\u2019s determination under appeal and the reconsideration decision under appeal in section 28 of the OAS Act is supposed to be from a Ministerial decision or determination about the \u201camount of a benefit that may be paid to the person.\u201d\nIncome-Related Question \u2013 Section 18 of the OAS Act\n[107] The most likely characterization of the Appellant\u2019s section 28 appeal to the SST is as an appeal of the Minister\u2019s determination under section 18 of the OAS Act that an overpayment of GIS benefits arose as a consequence of the Appellant\u2019s actual income not according with the Appellant\u2019s shown income.\n[108] There are two income-related questions under section 18: First, what is the applicant\u2019s actual income? Second, what is the applicant\u2019s shown income?\n(i) Shown Income\n[109] In the present context, the preamble of section 18 defines \u201cshown income\u201d as the Appellant\u2019s income calculated on the basis of an estimate made under section 14 of the OAS Act.\n[110] With respect to the GIS benefits that were paid for the period February 2018 to June 30, 2019, shown income would be the estimate of income the Appellant made in accordance with subsection 14(2) and paragraph 14(5)(b) and that the Minister initially accepted and used to compute the GIS benefits paid to the Appellant for months in that period. Those estimates of income are $6,160.00 for the GIS benefits paid for February 2018 to June 2018 and $90.00 for July 2018 to June 2019.\n[111] For the period July 2019 to June 2020, the situation is more complex, as the Minister issued the original January 28, 2020 determination partway through that period. At that time, I presume that seven months of GIS benefits would have already been paid on the basis of the estimate of income submitted by the Appellant in accordance with paragraph 14(5)(a) and, through the January 28, 2020 determination, the Minister advised the Appellant that the GIS benefits were being adjusted for that payment period to reflect a revised estimate of income that took into account the loss\/reduction of pension income which, now, the Minister considers to have not occurred. The Minister\u2019s March 2, 2022 reconsideration decision letter seems to suggest that the net impact of the Minister\u2019s adjustments and computations for that payment period was as a result of treating $232.00 as the Appellant\u2019s estimate of income for that period, such that this amount would be his shown income in respect of the GIS benefits that were paid in that payment period.\n(ii) Actual Income\n[112] \u201cActual income\u201d is defined in the preamble of the current version of section 18 of the OAS Act to mean \u201cthe income for a base calendar year\u2026for a supplement.\u201d In the case of a supplement that has already been paid on the basis of an estimate of income made under section 14, I interpret this to mean the income for a base calendar year for the payment period in which one finds the month for which the supplement was previously paid. As discussed previously, there is nothing in section 18 to suggest that, in determining actual income, the computation of income for a base calendar year would be modified or adjusted by the making of an estimate of income under section 14.\n[113] The fact that the election to use estimated income under section 14 has no impact on how one calculates the income for the relevant base calendar year \u2013- and, by implication, actual income for purposes of section 18 \u2013- is, of course, problematic for fulfilling the well-established purpose of the option regime in section 14, since the determination of whether there has been an overpayment is being made by comparing the benefits that were paid to the benefits computed using the individual\u2019s income for the base calendar, as computed under section 2 of the OAS Act, rather than the income from the sources used to make the estimate under section 14.\n[114] In L\u00e9vesque (discussed earlier)[16], the Court identified and resolved this very problem inherent with the application of section 18 in the context of the option method rules, on the following basis:\n[24] In the Minister\u2019s opinion, the appellant\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d within the meaning of this provision, would be appellant\u2019s true income based on his statement of income computed in accordance with subsection 14(5) of the OAS Act, while the \u201cshown income\u201d would be the income that the appellant had expected to receive in his initial application, also in accordance with subsection 14(5) of the OAS Act.\n* * * *\n[26] With respect, even though this interpretation has been used by the Minister for some time, it is not clear, on a prima facie basis, that this is allowed under the OAS Act.\n[27] Indeed, the Act does not give the concept of \u201cactual income\u201d the same meaning given the Minister. According to section 18 of the OAS Act, what is in fact defined as actual income is the appellant\u2019s income for the base calendar year, rather than his true income calculated under subsection 14(5) of the OAS after the production of his statement of income. In my opinion, this is indeed made clear by the following words: \u201cthe income for a base calendar year (in this section referred to as the \u201cactual income\u201d) of an applicant for a supplement\u201d.\n[28] The term \u201cbase calendar year\u201d is defined in section 10 of the OAS Act as \u201cthe last calendar year ending before the current payment period\u2026.\n[29[ In light of the foregoing and based on a literal interpretation, the Minister should have calculated the overpayment by comparing the [income for the base calendar year] to the amount of $5,583.96 and not the amount based on the appellant\u2019s true income, as was done by the Minister.\n[30] However, even though I consider this interpretation to be appropriate to the letter of the law, it is my opinion that the Minister\u2019s interpretation must prevail.\n* * * *\n[34] This therefore raises the following question: from this point of view, why would Parliament have enacted subsection 14(2) to (7) of the OAS Act? Why adopt provisions which seek to account for any declines in income if those provisions will inevitably create an overpayment that the Minister must ask to have reimbursed?\n[35] In this context, I think it is appropriate here to reiterate the principle of statutory interpretation known as the rule of effectivity. According to author Pierre-Andr\u00e9 C\u00f4t\u00e9, this rule holds that \u201can interpretation that gives legislation some effect is preferable to one that does not, because the legislature is presumed not to intervene gratuitously\u201d.\n[36] It is my opinion that this rule applies in this case. Indeed, recognizing a literal interpretation of subsections 2 to 7 of section 14 of the OAS Act would be tantamount to denying their fundamental purpose and even their existence, which seems contrary to Parliament\u2019s intention.\n[37] In any event, in this case, the Minister\u2019s interpretation is more advantageous for the appellant than the literal one. Indeed, according to the literal interpretation, the overpayment should be calculated based on the difference between the base calendar year\u2026and the income declared by the appellant in accordance with subsection 14(5) of the OAS Act\u2026However, in this case, the Minister calculated the overpayment by using the appellant\u2019s true income for the 2012 taxation year in accordance with subsection 14(5) of the OAS Act\u2026thereby reducing the overpayment.\n[38] In light of this information, I therefore believe that there is justification for confirming the Minister\u2019s interpretation of section 18 of the OAS Act in terms of the calculation method to be used.\n[115] The Court thus held that the Minister\u2019s long-standing interpretation \u2013 i.e., where an estimate was made under section 14, actual income in section 18 is the individual\u2019s true income computed in accordance with the rules in subsection 14(5) \u2013 would prevail in that case even though it was not supported by a literal reading of the text in that section.\n[116] It bears mentioning that the Minister\u2019s position on the interpretation of \u201cactual income\u201d for purposes of section 18 in L\u00e9vesque aligns with the literal interpretation of the relevant provisions prior to the section 14 amendments discussed earlier; language that dealt with the calculation of income for a base calendar year was a component of the pre-2007 version of the option method rules in Section 14. L\u00e9vesque involved paragraph 14(5)(a) of the OAS Act and, prior to the 2007 amendments, the text of that paragraph[17] provided the following [underlining added]:\n(5) Where, in the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b), a person who is an applicant\u2026ceases to hold an office or employment or ceases to carry on a business, the person may\u2026,\n(a) where the person ceases to hold that office or employment or to carry on that business in the last calendar year ending before the payment period, file a statement of the person\u2019s estimated income for the calendar year ending in the current payment period, in which case the person\u2019s income for that calendar year is deemed to be the person\u2019s income for the base calendar year;...\n[117] As previously discussed, the 2007 amendments to the option method rules removed the language under each of the scenarios that was directed at changing the meaning of income for the base calendar year for the period covered by the estimate. The fact that, prior to the 2007 amendments, the option method rules in section 14 traditionally had language that caused the income of the base calendar year to correspond with income computed in accordance with section 14 may explain why the Minister described the position taken in L\u00e9vesque as a long-standing government interpretation of how section 18 would apply to recover an overpayment where GIS benefits were previously paid on the basis of an estimate made under section 14.\n[118] As noted in the excerpt above from L\u00e9vesque, the Court relied on the \u201crule of effectivity\u201d to accept the Minister\u2019s interpretation and avoid what would otherwise been an absurd result. However, the effect of the Minister\u2019s interpretation is to restore language to section 14 of the OAS Act that makes a link between estimated income and income from a base calendar year that was intentionally removed under the 2007 amendments to that section. In light of the history and the fact that the 2007 amendments to section 14 of the OAS Act were part of an extensive package of amendment that I presume to have been carefully considered, I do not feel that this an appropriate circumstance to adopt an interpretation that departs from the language used in section 18 (and subsections 14(2) to (6)) solely on the basis that a literal interpretation would produce an absurd result. The Supreme Court of Canada cautioned against such an approach in R. v. McIntosh,[18] stating (per Lamer C.J. for the unanimous Court):\n[34] I am the view that the Crown\u2019s argument linking absurdity to ambiguity cannot succeed. I would adopt the following proposition; where, by the use of clear and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by the legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be (Maxell on the Interpretation of Statues, supra, at p. 29). The fact that a provision gives rise to absurd results is not, in my opinion, sufficient to declare it ambiguous and then embark upon a broad ranging interpretation.\n* * * *\n[36] Thus, only where a statutory provision is ambiguous, and therefore reasonably open to two interpretations, will absurd results flowing form one of the available interpretations justify rejecting it in favour of the other. Absurdity is a factor to consider in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, but there is not distinct \u201cabsurdity approach\u201d.\n[119] Consequently, for purposes of this reference, I will not interpret actual income in section 18 to mean estimated income computed in accordance with an applicable option method rule in section 14.\n[120] However, the Federal Court of Appeal had the opportunity to interpret the meaning of \u201cactual income\u201d in section 18 in Grenier[19]. The Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation is binding on this Court and I believe it can be applied in a way that avoids an absurd result in the context of the Appellant\u2019s appeal of the Minister\u2019s determination.\n[121] Grenier was an appeal from a Tax Court decision involving the Minister\u2019s determination of a GIS overpayment arising as a consequence of a difference between (i) the estimate of income of $11,892 he made for 2005, which was the year after his 2004 retirement from employment, and (ii) his 2005 income of $16,722, which was known after his 2005 income tax return was filed and assessed. The individual had elected the option method for a payment period following his retirement to have his monthly GIS benefits computed using his $11,892 estimate of 2005 income instead of his $20,627 income for 2004, the base calendar year in relation to the payment period. His 2004 income included $7,065 of employment income and he anticipated having nil employment income in 2005.\n[122] The Minister made a determination under section 18 of the OAS Act to recover an overpayment based on the difference between the (i) GIS benefits paid based on Mr. Grenier\u2019s $16,722 estimate of income for 2005, and (ii) the amount of GIS benefits that would have been payable for the period based on his $16,722 actual income for the 2005 calendar year. The Tax Court confirmed the Minister\u2019s determination that there was an overpayment under section 18.\n[123] In dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, the Court stated [underlining in original]:\n[4] The Department Minister invoked section 18 of the Act, which reads as follows:\n18. Where is it determined that the income for a base calendar year (in this section referred to as the \u201cactual income\u201d) of an applicant for a supplement does not accord with the income of the applicant (in this section referred to as the \u201cshown income\u201d) calculated on the basis of a statement or an estimate made under section 14, the following adjustments shall be made:\n(a) if the actual income exceeds the shown income, any amount by which the supplement paid to the applicant for months in the payment period exceeds the supplement that would have been paid to the applicant for these months if the shown income had been equal to the actual income shall be deducted and retained our of any subsequent payments or pension made to the applicant, in any manner that may be prescribed; and\n(b) if the shown income exceeds the actual income, there shall be paid to the applicant any amount by which the supplement that would have been paid to the applicant to the applicant for months in the payment period if the actual income had been equal to the shown income exceeds the supplement paid to the applicant for those months.\n[5] Because there was a difference between \u201cactual income\u201d ($16,722) earned in 2005, the reference year chosen by Mr. Grenier under section 14 of the Act, and the \u201cshown income\u201d for Mr. Grenier ($11,892), an adjustment had to be made under section 18 of the Act. As a result, an overpayment of $110 was calculated as having been made to Mr. Grenier.\n[124] In the excerpt above, the Federal Court of Appeal found that \u201cactual income\u201d for purposes of section 18 was Mr. Grenier\u2019s income for the year that he elected to use for computing his GIS benefits pursuant to section 14 of the Act, as reported in the tax filings he made after the benefits had been paid. While I recognize that Grenier would have involved a version of subsection 14 that pre-dated the 2007 amendments and that the option method rule in section 14 Mr. Grenier elected to use would have included language to deem Mr. Grenier\u2019s 2005 income to be his income for the base calendar year, neither the Federal Court of Appeal nor the Tax Court referred to this language in section 14 in their respective reasons for decision.\n[125] Accordingly, on the basis of Grenier, I will interpret \u201cactual income\u201d under section 18 for purposes of this reference to be the Appellant\u2019s income for the calendar year in respect of which an estimate was made under section 14. Under subsection 14(2), paragraph 14(5)(a) and paragraph 14(5)(b), the Appellant provided an estimate of income for the 2018 calendar year, 2019 calendar year, and the 2018 calendar year, respectively. The parties agreed that the Appellant\u2019s income for the 2018 calendar year for GIS purposes is $4,117.84 and I find that the Appellant\u2019s income for the 2019 calendar year for GIS purposes is $3.00, as determined by the Minister and shown in the table on the first page of the Minister\u2019s March 2, 2022 reconsideration decision letter.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS ON INCOME-RELATED QUESTIONS RELEVANT TO MINISTER\u2019S DETERMINATION UNDER APPEAL TO THE SST\n[126] The conclusions that I have made above concerning the income-related matters that I considered to be relevant to the Appellant\u2019s section 28 appeal of the Minister\u2019s March 2, 2022 reconsideration decision are summarized below.\n[127] First, for purposes of section 14 of the OAS Act, I find that, in the context of the Appellant\u2019s circumstances, he was not required to include or anticipate his 2018 or 2019 lump sum withdrawals from his RRIF in computing his estimated income under subsection 14(2), or paragraphs 14(5)(a) and (b), of the OAS Act and that his estimated income under those provisions are $6,160.00 of 2018 estimated income under subsection 14(2), $90.00 of 2018 estimated income under paragraph 14(5)(b), and $162.84 of 2019 estimated income under paragraph 14(5)(a).\n[128] Second, for purposes of sections 12 and 12.1 of the OAS Act, I find that the Appellant\u2019s incomes for the base calendar years are, as follows: (i) for months in the payment period June 2017 to July 2018, income for the base calendar year is the $56,909.00 income for the 2016 calendar year, (ii) for months in the payment period June 2018 to July 2019, income for the base calendar year is the $42,394.00 income for the 2017 calendar year, and (iii) for months in the payment period July 2019 to June 2020, income for the base calendar year is the $4,117.84 income for the 2018 calendar year.\n[129] Third, for purposes of section 18 of the OAS Act, I find that the Appellant\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d is, as follows: (i) in relation to the GIS benefits paid pursuant to an estimate of income for the 2018 calendar year under subsection 14(2), actual income is $4,117.84 income for the 2018 calendar year, (ii) in relation to the GIS benefits paid pursuant to an estimate of income for the 2018 calendar year made under paragraph 14(5)(b), actual income is $4,117.84 income for the 2018 calendar year, and (iii) in relation to the GIS benefits paid pursuant to an estimate of income for the 2019 calendar year made under paragraph 14(5)(a), actual income is $3.00 income for the 2019 calendar year. I decline to make formal findings with respect to \u201cshown income\u201d for purposes of section 18, since these are income amounts on which GIS benefits have already been paid to the Appellant and should not be in dispute.\n[130] In accordance with Section 45 of the OAS Regulations, there will be no award as to costs.\nThese Amended Reasons for Judgment are issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated June 6, 2024 in order to revise the words underscored in paragraphs 18, 21, 22, 27, 32, and 80 from \u201cCanstar Markham\u201d to \u201cCarstar Markham\u201d, and paragraphs 7, 69, and 124, and Page 1 of the Appendix hereof to correct typographical errors.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario, this 17th day of June 2024.\n\u201cJohn C.

This is something that we call options. It is a complicated provision at the moment, which we are trying to simplify. The legislation currently allows seniors who retire or who suffer a loss of earnings or a reduction in pension in a given year to provide an estimate of their current income in order to qualify for the low-income benefits. Applicants are required right now to estimate income from all sources, whether it\u2019s employment, interest from investments, or pension income. This process can be very cumbersome because it is difficult to accurately predict all of your income from all sources.\nThe proposed legislation would limit the estimated income to pension and employment income only, which is much easier to predict on an annual basis and predict accurately.\nIt will also extend the time for seniors to submit an estimate of their income, because the current deadlines can be very tight. This change, we think, will be very welcomed by low income seniors, because it will mean fewer adjustments, and it will simplify the administration by greatly reducing the complexity of this provision.\n[14] S.C. 1995, c. 33, s. 9(1).\n[15] See section 15 under the original amendments to the OAS Act to implement the GIS regime, enacted by S.C. 1966, c. 65, s. 2 and reproduced in the Appendix.\n[16] Supra, note 4.\n[17] S.C. 1998, c. 21, s. 110(2).\n[18] [1995] S.C.R. 686.\n[19] Supra, note 7.\n",

Introduction\/Overview\n[1] From 2004 to 2008, the appellants promoted and distributed Mr. Porisky\u2019s views on taxation under the name Paradigm Education Group to interested members of the public. The Paradigm system was based on the view that the tax legislation can be interpreted in such a way as to allow one to opt out of paying income tax or collecting GST.\n[2] The appellants hosted Paradigm seminars led by Mr. Porisky, and sold tickets to attend. They sold Paradigm books, training manuals, and videos as well as created a cascading fee arrangement whereby they would receive a share of fees collected by educators who taught Paradigm\u2019s views to paying students.\n[3] Over the five years under appeal, the appellants received gross revenues totalling over $1.4M while reporting no income, paying no income tax, and remitting no GST. They were convicted of criminal tax offences and served their sentences. The present appeals deal with the assessment side of their Paradigm activities.\nII. Issues\n[4] The issues are as follows:\nWith respect to Mr. Porisky:\nWhether he earned unreported income totalling $569,277 in the 2004 to 2008 taxation years, being half of the net revenue received through Paradigm Education Group during that period;[1]\nWhether the Minister of National Revenue properly assessed penalties under section 162 of the Income Tax Act for failure to file his 2004 to 2008 returns;[2] and\nWhether the Minister properly assessed gross negligence penalties with respect to 2004.\nWith respect to Ms. Gould:\nWhether she earned unreported income totalling $569,277 in the 2004 to 2008 taxation years, being half of the net revenue received through Paradigm Education Group during that period;[3] and\nWhether the Minister of National Revenue properly assessed penalties under section 162 of the Income Tax Act for failure to file her 2004 to 2008 returns.[4]\nWith respect to Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould:\nWhether as a partnership, they failed to collect and remit net GST totalling $67,165.17 for the period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008;[5]\nWhether as a partnership, they failed to file GST returns for the same period and were liable for penalties under section 280.1 of the Excise Tax Act;[6]\nWhether the Minister properly assessed them as a partnership for gross negligence penalties under section 285 of the Excise Tax Act for the same period;[7] and\nWhether as members of the partnership, they were jointly and severally liable under subsection 272.1(5) of the Excise Tax Act, for the partnership\u2019s failure to pay\/remit net GST, penalties, and interest totalling $98,632.09.[8]\nIII. Preliminary matters\n[5] At the commencement of the hearing, the respondent advised the Court that they were conceding Ms. Gould\u2019s appeal numbered 2012-3780(IT)G. The respondent also brought a corresponding preliminary motion to quash Mr. Porisky\u2019s appeal numbered 2012-3782(IT)G because he purported to appeal this assessment of Ms. Gould.\n[6] The motion to quash was granted because Ms. Gould is the proper appellant with respect to her assessment numbered 2012-3780(IT)G, which has now been conceded by the respondent in any event.\n[7] The summary of issues at paragraph 2 of these reasons does not include these two matters and the remaining five appeals were heard on common evidence.\n[8] At the close of evidence during the hearing, the appellants asked to make their submissions in writing rather than orally. I granted their request and heard only oral argument from the respondent, after which the appellant\u2019s written submissions and the respondent\u2019s written answer were received in January 2023.\nIV. Factual background\n[9] Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould have been living together as common-law spouses since about 1998 and they have seven children in their blended family. Back in 2004, their children ranged in age from about 10 years old to young adults.\n[10] Ms. Gould stated that people began to show interest in Mr. Porisky\u2019s views on income tax in about 2000. Her friend organized a well-attended seminar which inspired them to share his views more regularly and broadly.\n[11] In 2001, Mr. Porisky founded the Paradigm Education Group, which presented seminars about the Canadian income tax system to paying participants.[9] He is presently working as a handyman and before starting Paradigm, he worked in the construction industry.\n[12] Mr. Porisky explained that through extensive reading of\/about the Income Tax Act and Excise Tax Act since about 1993, he observed there to be a duality with respect to taxpayers. He noted that these statutes described individuals to be natural persons and concluded that there must be situations in which people are not subject to taxes. He stated that he started Paradigm because it was his duty to share this information and that people wanted to hear what he had to say. He explained that in his view, income tax was actually a labour tax resulting in a form of slavery which in turn was a crime against humanity.\n[13] Mr. Porisky stated that one of the distinctions put forth by Paradigm was that of the natural versus artificial person. He explained that based on his interpretation of the definitions of \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201ccommercial activity\u201d, a person not pursuing profit would not be required to pay income tax, and the tax becomes a tax on labour.\n[14] He testified that he felt obliged to share this information at Paradigm seminars. He also engaged other people to help disseminate this information and referred to them as \u201ceducators\u201d. He mentored the educators who would in turn share the information with students; the students would then in turn decide whether to become educators and help others.\n[15] He stated that interest in Paradigm grew and by 2004, he did not have a sense of how many students and educators there were. However, he did acknowledge in cross-examination that Paradigm had educated about 800 students in total.\n[16] In Mr. Porisky\u2019s view, Paradigm was not a business or a commercial endeavour but instead arose from a passion-driven duty. He stated that Paradigm had no employees and only Ms. Gould helped from time to time. He recalled that at the time, at least three children were being homeschooled and Ms. Gould also ran the household. He would work on Paradigm for many hours in a back room of their house while she took care of the family.\n[17] Ms. Gould helped him at seminars, as well as packaged and shipped orders for materials purchased by educators and students. Telephone calls coming to their home for Paradigm initially went to Mr. Porisky but if they related to merchandise orders, he returned the caller to her.\n[18] Orders were made by telephone, email, or in person at seminars. Ms. Gould stated that they only accepted payment in cheque or cash, as Mr. Porisky was not set up for credit card purchases. In handling the orders, Ms. Gould made payment arrangements, filled order forms, created invoices, and shipped the orders. The product invoices prepared and signed by Ms. Gould listed the items sold, the sale prices, and the total due without GST. There was a note printed on each invoice stating that GST was non-applicable, per paragraph 240(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act.[10] She explained that Mr. Porisky had determined through his research that since there was no business, there was no obligation to collect GST.\n[19] In addition to books and videos, he created labour reimbursement contracts to further distinguish between income tax versus labour tax, the latter of which he stated was not permitted. Students attended three or four presentations a year on different topics and were tested on the subject matter, for which he had also created study manuals. The books, videos, study manuals, and contracts were all available for the educators and students to purchase.\n[20] Mr. Porisky testified that Paradigm also held seminars and charged a fee to those wishing to attend. He was the speaker at most of these events because educators and students lacked the necessary depth of knowledge. He stated that wherever there was an educator willing to put the event together, he would attend to speak. He recalled speaking at seminars in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.\n[21] Ms. Gould stated that she used what she learned from her friend\u2019s organization of the first seminar, to organize Paradigm\u2019s seminars going forward. The educator would typically identify an out-of-town venue and make the initial booking, the cost of which Paradigm paid later. Ms. Gould stated that she handled the administrative arrangements and attended the events to ensure things went smoothly. She also typically signed the venue contract and took care of payment.[11]\n[22] Copies of venue and catering contracts show that Ms. Gould was listed as the Paradigm contact and signed the agreements.[12] Posters advertising the seminars showed the contact names to be either Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould together, or Ms. Gould alone.[13] She stated that by 2004, she attended most of the out-of-town seminars and sometimes took their children, who sat with her at the welcome table.\n[23] Participants purchased seminar tickets either from an educator in advance or from Ms. Gould at the door. In addition to greeting people at the door, she sometimes made the video-recording for future DVD distribution although that task was more regularly done by the educators. She and the children then watched Mr. Porisky\u2019s completed videos to catch technical glitches.\n[24] The print jobs of Paradigm\u2019s books and study manuals were a joint effort in that Mr. Porisky sent the order to the printer and they would attend at the printer together so that he could load the materials into the truck while she wrote a cheque in payment.\n[25] They both acknowledged that most or all of the funds received for Paradigm\u2019s activities were deposited into their joint bank account. Ms. Gould stated that she handled Paradigm\u2019s mail as part of the household\u2019s mail. Cheques for Paradigm came to their home address, she deposited them into their joint account, and maintained a deposit book. She stated that the bank gave her the deposit book for tracking because she was regularly bringing large volumes of cheques for deposit. She was also responsible for writing cheques to pay Paradigm\u2019s costs. She stated that all of their household expenses were paid out of the same joint account.\n[26] Paradigm had a cascading compensation system for educators in which educators leading a study group would receive most of the fees paid by attending students, while Paradigm and the educator\u2019s mentor (Mr. Porisky) would receive the balance.[14] In submitting their compensation invoices to Paradigm, educators sometimes wrote accompanying explanations directed to Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould together.[15]\n[27] Educators paid for Mr. Porisky\u2019s mentorship either by paying in full or in installments. Ms. Gould maintained a record of the payment arrangements which seemed to typically total $2,500 per educator.[16] She also signed each form setting out the due dates and amounts of each payment in the particular arrangement.[17]\n[28] Mr. Porisky stated that he filed a return for 2004 in March 2006 because he received a request from Canada Revenue Agency to do so. Otherwise, he did not file any returns as in his view, he was not required to report the amounts he received. In his 2004 return, he reported no income and no taxes payable.[18]\n[29] Ms. Gould did not file any returns for 2004 to 2008. She stated that she did not believe she was working outside the home, did not earn any taxable income, and did not want any income tax benefits. She stated that she decided to wait for the Minister to send a request to file before filing a return but never received one.\n[30] In cross-examination, Mr. Porisky stated that he did not dispute the assessed amounts because they were based on concepts that did not apply to his situation. He explained that in his view, Paradigm was not a business so it was not an income source for tax purposes; accordingly, there would be no need to deduct business expenses or collect GST. He testified that Paradigm was personal because he was Paradigm, so monies coming in or going out were on personal account. They both asserted that Ms. Gould she was a volunteer and carried out the Paradigm tasks for her own enjoyment.\n[31] The amounts assessed against the appellants break down as follows (not including penalties and interest):[19]\nAmounts Assessed Against Appellants Break Down\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\nTotal\nGross revenue\n$174,195.14\n$317,419.08\n$384,118.30\n$328,271.04\n$222,492.01\n$1,426,495.50\nAllowable expenses\n$88,422.03\n$66,172.69\n$40,343.46\n$49,837.67\n$43,166.78\n$287,942.63\nNet business income\n$85,773.11\n$251,246.39\n$343,774.84\n$278,433.38\n$179,325.23\n$1,138,552.90\n50% partnership share\n$42,886.55\n$125,623.20\n$171,887.42\n$139,216.69\n$89,662.62\n$569,276.45\nGST payable on net business income\n$5,611.32\n$16,436.68\n$20,817.49\n$15,760.38\n$8,539.30\n$67,165.17\n[32] Gross revenue was based on cheques made payable to Mr. Porisky, Ms. Gould, and Paradigm.[20] Disallowed expenses included such items as a time share in Las Vegas in 2006, 2007, and 2008, $33,307 in gold purchased in 2005, a family trip to Disneyland in 2006, a Chilliwack townhouse purchased for $112,540 in 2005, and a Chilliwack house purchased for $316,250 in 2007.[21] The townhouse and house were registered in Ms. Gould\u2019s name. Different rates for the GST were applied depending on the year.[22]\n[33] Mr. Porisky did the occasional building job from 2004 to 2008, but acknowledged that he provided for his family through his Paradigm activities. Ms. Gould was a dental assistant until about 1995 or 1996, after which she worked in a garden centre until late 1999 or early 2000.\n[34] Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould were ultimately convicted by a jury of income tax evasion under section 239 of the Income Tax Act. In addition, Mr. Porisky was convicted of counselling fraud under section 464 of the Criminal Code and GST evasion under section 327 of the Excise Tax Act. Mr. Porisky was sentenced to 5\u00bd years\u2019 imprisonment and fined a total of $259,482.33 for income tax and GST evasion, while Ms. Gould was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment and fined $38,241.72 for income tax evasion. An apportionment of 80-20 was applied to their income, based on a finding that Ms. Gould\u2019s participation in the tax evasion scheme was 20% while Mr. Porisky\u2019s was 80%.[23]\nV. Legal framework \u2013 Business source of income (income tax)\n[35] It is well established that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, there must be an income source in order for there to be income in a taxation year.[24] Where the income source is a business, then a taxpayer\u2019s income for a particular tax year is their profit from the business in that year.[25]\n[36] The litmus test for whether there is an income source continues to be the two-step approach set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Stewart[26], i.e.:\nIs the activity in question undertaken in pursuit of profit, or is it a personal endeavour?[27]\nIn other words, does the taxpayer intend to carry on the activity for profit and is there objective evidence to support that subjective intention?[28] The taxpayer must show that their predominant intention is to make a profit from the activity and that the activity has been conducted so as to be consistent with objective standards of business-like behaviour.[29]\nIf it is not a personal endeavour, is the source of the income a business or property?[30]\n[37] Where the activity: (a) appears to be clearly commercial, (b) contains no personal or hobby element, and (c) the evidence is consistent with the view that the activity is conducted for profit, then a source of income exists for the purposes of the Act.[31] However, where the activity could be considered a personal pursuit, then one must ask if the activity is being carried on in a sufficiently commercial manner so as to be a source of income.[32]\nVI. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Business source of income (income tax)\nA. Was the activity in question undertaken in pursuit of profit, or was it a personal endeavour? [38] In addition to using Mr. Porisky\u2019s views on taxation to guide their own tax decisions, the appellants sold the information to interested purchasers in the form of seminars, videos, books, and study manuals. They created a pyramid-like, cascading system of compensation which gave them a percentage share of monies received by educators even when the appellants were not directly involved with a particular group of students.\n[39] Over the five-year period under appeal, they earned gross revenue totalling over $1.4M from these activities and other than some occasional building work done by Mr. Porisky, they had no other revenue source. During this time, they used these earnings to pay for every aspect of their lives including the purchase of (among other things) a Las Vegas time share, a townhouse, a second house, gold, and a family vacation to Disneyland.\n[40] The seminar organized by Ms. Gould\u2019s friend in about 2000 to gauge interest in Mr. Porisky\u2019s views on taxation might be considered the start-up phase. Once the appellants realized there was significant interest, they marketed the information and created a system by which to earn revenue from it.\n[41] It is clear that by 2004, Paradigm was a profit-making activity conducted in a manner consistent with objective standards of business-like behaviour. For example, the appellants advertised seminars directly or through Paradigm educators, they sold tickets for these seminars, they booked and paid for venues in which to hold these seminars, they marketed and sold training materials by mail order and telephone order, and they created a cascading system of compensation which ensured that they received the lion\u2019s share of profits.\n[42] The appellants offer a convoluted and head-spinning interpretation of the tax legislation that relies on semantics to say that the Income Tax Act and Excise Tax Act do not apply to their situation. However, their assertion that Mr. Porisky was Paradigm only means that Paradigm was unincorporated.\n[43] Therefore, Paradigm was an income source for the appellants.\nB. If it is not a personal endeavour, is the source of income a business or property? [44] Paradigm\u2019s income was generated from the sale of Mr. Porisky\u2019s ideas by way of a system created by the appellants to facilitate the promotion and distribution of those ideas for money. Considering Mr. Porisky\u2019s passionate views on the subject matter, I would characterize Paradigm as a \u201ccalling\u201d or an \u201cundertaking of any kind whatever\u201d within the definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d.[33]\n[45] With respect to quantum, the appellants did not present any evidence to contradict the amounts assessed so the Minister\u2019s assumptions in this regard have not been rebutted.\nVII. Legal framework \u2013 Partnership (income tax)\n[46] The B.C. Partnership Act states that a partnership is \u201cthe relation which subsists between persons carrying on business in common with a view of profit.\u201d[34] In addition, a person\u2019s receipt of a share of the profits of a business is proof in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the person is a partner in the business.[35]\n[47] In order for there to be a partnership for tax purposes, the provincial definition of \u201cpartnership\u201d must be satisfied.[36] The same three ingredients are considered essential across the common law jurisdictions: (a) a business, (b) carried on in common, and (c) with a view to profit.[37]\n[48] With respect to apportionment, the starting point is that partners hold equal interests, subject to any express or implied agreement.[38] In addition, allocating partnership interest based on business-related criteria (e.g. work performed, capital invested) makes sense where close family members representing one economic unit are involved such as a spouse or children, and tax planning appeared to be a key factor in the allocations.[39]\nVIII. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Partnership (income tax)\n[49] I have already affirmatively addressed elements (a) and (c) in my above discussion with respect to a business source of income.\n[50] With respect to whether the business was carried on in common, it was clear from the evidence that the views on taxation (as marketed by Paradigm) originated from Mr. Porisky. However, it was also clear that Ms. Gould was primarily responsible for all administrative aspects of the operation.\n[51] With respect to the seminars, she was the contact name for the venues for both the booking and catering contracts. She attended most of the out-of-town seminars and greeted participants at the welcome desk, while also accepting their payments for tickets. She received, processed, and shipped merchandise orders. She kept records of the installment payments owed by educators for Mr. Porisky\u2019s mentorship, and wrote cheques to pay Paradigm\u2019s expenses. Finally, all monies coming in or going out with respect to Paradigm went through the appellants\u2019 joint bank account and she did all of the banking.\n[52] The appellants\u2019 division of labour shows that they carried on the business in common. Therefore, they were partners in Paradigm.\n[53] The criminal sentences imposed on the appellants applied an 80-20 apportionment as between Mr. Porisky and Ms. Gould; however it was based on their criminal culpability in that the views on taxation (leading to evasion) originated from Mr. Porisky.\n[54] For tax purposes, the considerations are business-related when determining partnership interest. The appellants are spouses representing one economic unit.[40] All revenue from Paradigm was deposited into their joint account but the townhouse and house were purchased in Ms. Gould\u2019s name only. The appellants testified that the monies used to purchase these properties in 2005 and 2007 came from Paradigm\u2019s activities but were Mr. Porisky\u2019s gift to Ms. Gould.\n[55] On a balance, it appears that while the appellants were avoiding their tax obligations by relying on their flawed reading of the tax legislation, they were also trying to engage in tax planning by putting the townhouse and house in Ms. Gould\u2019s name and characterizing the purchase monies as a gift. While Mr. Porisky originated his views on taxation and believed in them first, it was clear from Ms. Gould\u2019s testimony that she came to believe in them equally.\n[56] There was no evidence to suggest that this Court should deviate from the starting point of an equal partnership. Therefore, the appellants were 50-50 partners in Paradigm and the income amounts were attributed appropriately as between them.\nIX. Legal framework \u2013 Gross negligence (income tax)\n[57] Subsection 163(2) of the Income Tax Act states that:\n163. (2) False statements or omissions \u2013 Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty\u2026\n[58] Gross negligence involves greater neglect than a failure to use reasonable care. It is a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting and an indifference to whether the law is complied with or not.[41]\nX. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Gross negligence (income tax)\n[59] Mr. Porisky reported no income and no tax payable in his 2004 return while knowing that: (a) he and Ms. Gould received gross revenue of $174,195 from their Paradigm activities that year, (b) he had negligible or no income from any other source, and (c) his and his family\u2019s lifestyle was funded by the Paradigm revenue.\n[60] His views on taxation led him to conclude that Paradigm\u2019s activities fell outside the Income Tax Act. Regardless of whether he genuinely believed so or not, his decision not to report the Paradigm income was a false statement or omission. He either demonstrated an indifference as to whether the law was complied with or not, or a deliberate preference not to comply. It is at the heart of gross negligence.\nXI. Legal framework \u2013 Failure-to-file penalties (income tax)\n[61] Subsection 162(1) of the Income Tax Act says that every person who fails to file a return of income for a tax year as and when required is liable to a penalty. Depending on the particular circumstances (i.e. a late return versus no return), this penalty is referred to as a late-filing penalty or a failure-to-file penalty. Regardless, it is the same penalty.\n[62] The repeated-failure-to-file penalty under subsection 162(2) has more prerequisites in order to be imposed, specifically: (a) the person fails to file a return of income for a tax year as and when required, (b) the Minister has sent the person a demand to file the return, and (c) a failure-to-file penalty under subsection 162(1) was assessed for any of the three preceding years.\nXII. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Failure-to-file penalties (income tax)\n[63] The appellants\u2019 evidence was clear that the only return filed was by Mr. Porisky in 2006 with respect to the 2004 taxation year, after receiving a demand from the Minister. Mr. Porisky acknowledged in cross-examination that he did not file returns for the 2005 to 2008 years. Ms. Gould testified that she intended to only file a return if she received a demand from the Minister; she did not receive any demands so she filed no returns for the 2004 to 2008 years.\n[64] The respondent\u2019s pleadings[42] and submissions refer to failure-to-file penalties under both subsections 162(1) and (2), while not distinguishing between the failure to file (or late-file) and a repeated failure to do so. Other than the demand for Mr. Porisky to file his 2004 return, there was no mention of or reference to the prerequisites required to impose a repeated-failure-to-file penalty anywhere. While I did not address it with counsel during the hearing, it is clear that the penalties were assessed under subsection 162(1) and the requirements have been met.\nXIII. Legal framework \u2013 Unremitted GST\n[65] Every taxable supply made in Canada is subject to the GST.[43] Subject to certain exceptions which do not apply in this appeal, a \u201csupply\u201d is defined as the provision of property or a service in any manner including sale, transfer, barter, exchange, gift, or disposition.[44] I have only listed the most relevant examples of inclusions. A \u201ctaxable supply\u201d is in turn defined as a supply made in the course of a commercial activity.[45]\n[66] For the purposes of this appeal, a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d means as a business, or an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.[46] A \u201cbusiness\u201d includes:\na profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatever, whether the activity or undertaking is engaged in for profit, and any activity engaged in on a regular or continuous basis that involves the supply of property by way of lease, licence or similar arrangement, but does not include an office or employment[47]\nThe definition is more comprehensive than its counterpart in the Income Tax Act and is unconcerned with whether the activity is profit-motivated.\n[67] For the reasons already given with respect to business source of income, the appellants\u2019 Paradigm operation was both a business and a commercial activity under the Excise Tax Act. They supplied services which consisted primarily of seminars and mentorship, as well as goods including training manuals, books, and videos.\n[68] Neither the goods nor the services were exempt or zero-rated under schedules V and VI of the Act, respectively. Therefore, they were supplies taxable at the prescribed rate for the periods under appeal, and the appellants were obliged to collect and remit the resulting GST.\n[69] For the reasons already given with respect to partnership for income tax purposes, the appellants operated Paradigm as an equal partnership for GST purposes as well. Since the supplies exceeded the small-supplier threshold of $30,000[48] per year (i.e. four quarters) and a partnership is a \u201cperson\u201d under the Act[49], the appellants were required to register their partnership for GST purposes.\n[70] With respect to quantum, the appellants did not present any evidence to contradict the amounts assessed so the Minister\u2019s assumptions in this regard have not been rebutted.\nXIV. Legal framework \u2013 Failure-to-file penalties (GST)\n[71] Section 280.1 of the Excise Tax Act says that every person who fails to file a return for a reporting period as and when required is liable to a penalty. Depending on the particular circumstances (i.e. a late return versus no return), this penalty is referred to as a late-filing penalty or a failure-to-file penalty. Regardless, it is the same penalty.\n[72] The appellants did not file GST returns because they were of the view that the obligations under the Act did not apply to their Paradigm activities. For the reasons already given with respect to unremitted GST, they were required to file returns as a partnership making taxable supplies in the course of their commercial activity. Since they did not do so, the requirements of section 280.1 are met.\nXV. Legal framework \u2013 Gross negligence (GST)\n[73] Section 285 of the Excise Tax Act states that:\n285. [Gross negligence penalty for] False statements or omissions \u2013 Every person who knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, makes or participates in, assents to or acquiesces in the making of a false statement or omission in a return, application, form, certificate, statement, invoice or answer (each of which is in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) made in respect of a reporting period or transaction is liable to a penalty\u2026\n[74] Other than a change in tense and the use of terminology specific to the GST, the wording of the provision is identical to the gross negligence provision under the Income Tax Act. Therefore, the principles and thresholds applied are the same.\n[75] As with income tax, gross negligence involves greater neglect than a failure to use reasonable care. It is a high degree of negligence tantamount to intentional acting and an indifference to whether the law is complied with or not.[50]\nXVI. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Gross negligence (GST)\n[76] Through their Paradigm activity, the appellants made supplies of goods and services and received payment from their recipients in turn. From 2004 to 2008, they received gross revenues ranging from $174,195 in 2004 to $384,118 in 2006, and totalling over $1.4M over the five-year period. They had negligible income from any other sources and their family\u2019s lifestyle was funded by the Paradigm revenue.\n[77] GST-exempt situations are few and the obligation to collect and remit GST is the default under the Act. The appellants relied on Mr. Porisky\u2019s views on taxation to conclude that Paradigm\u2019s activities fell outside the Excise Tax Act. The nature of those views is sufficiently illogical and unreasonable so as to make their decision not to register for, collect, remit, or report GST culpable omissions. They demonstrated an indifference as to whether the law was complied with or not, or a deliberate preference not to comply. In fact, their product invoices stated that GST was not applicable per paragraph 240(1)(a), which is the registration provision.\n[78] Therefore, the appellants as a partnership were grossly negligent for GST purposes.\nXVII. Legal framework \u2013 Joint and several liability of partners (GST)\n[79] Subsection 272.1(5) of the Excise Tax Act says that a partnership and each member (past and present) are jointly and severally liable for the payment or remittance of all amounts owed by the partnership as well as all other obligations arising while the members were in the partnership.[51]\nXVIII. Analysis and discussion \u2013 Joint and several liability of partners (GST)\n[80] Since I have found that the appellants were a partnership during the years under appeal, it follows that they are jointly and severally liable for the amounts owed by the partnership in that period.\nXIX. Other \u2013 New issues raised in the appellants\u2019 written submissions\n[81] The appellants\u2019 written submissions sought to introduce a Charter argument and present copies of correspondence not tendered at the hearing.\n[82] I must decline to consider either because: (a) with respect to constitutional questions, there is a protocol which includes notice requirements, all of which precede the hearing of the appeals[52], and (b) with respect to the correspondence, it is fresh evidence which cannot be introduced after the hearing is concluded.\nXX. Conclusion\n[83] Ms. Gould\u2019s appeal numbered 2012-3780(IT)G is allowed, as conceded by the respondent.\n[84] Mr. Porisky\u2019s appeal numbered 2012-3782(IT)G is quashed.\n[85] The remaining appeals, being 2012-3460(IT)G, 2012-3462(GST)G, 2012-3459(IT)G, 2012-3461(GST)G, and 2012-3463(GST)G are dismissed.\n[86] Given the substantial success of the respondents, the respondent is entitled to costs.\n[87] The parties shall have until October 1, 2024 to reach an agreement as to costs, failing which the respondent shall file written submissions by November 1, 2024 and the appellants shall file a written response by December 2, 2024. Any such submissions shall not exceed ten pages in length.\n[88] If the parties do not advise the Court that they have reached an agreement and no submissions are received by these dates, then one set of costs shall be awarded to the respondent in accordance with Tariff B.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 7th day of June 2024.\n\u201cSusan Wong\u201d\nWong J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 84\nCOURT FILE NOS.:\n2012-3460(IT)G, 2012-3462(GST)G, 2012-3782(IT)G, 2012-3459(IT)G, 2012-3461(GST)G, 2012-3780(IT)G and 2012-3463(GST)G\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRUSSELL ANTHONY PORISKY ET AL.

INTRODUCTION [1] These appeals concern, Osaka Sushi (\u201cOsaka\u201d) a sushi restaurant located in North York, Ontario. The corporate Appellant, who operated Osaka, was 2467769 Ontario Inc. The other Appellant in this appeal, Coco Qi (\u201cMs. Qi\u201d), is the sole shareholder of 2467769 Ontario Inc.\n[2] After CRA\u2019s completion of an audit of Osaka, the Minister reassessed 2467769 Ontario Inc. and Ms. Qi\u2019s tax liabilities to include unreported business income or unreported shareholder benefits, as applicable. Unremitted GST\/HST was reassessed to 2467769 Ontario Inc. The Minister also imposed penalties pursuant to subsection 163(2) and 163(3) (only for 2467769 Ontario Inc.) of the Income Tax Act, RSC 1985 c1 (5th Supp) (\u201cITA\u201d); and section 285 and 285.01 (2) (only for 2467769 Ontario Inc.) of Excise Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-15 (\u201cETA\u201d).\n[3] The overall conclusion of the audit was that Osaka did not report a percentage of cash sales for each year. The Minister determined that Osaka employed some sort of device to suppress cash sales in their books and records. The Minister further concluded that these unreported cash sales were obtained by Ms. Qi as a shareholder benefit.\n[4] The issues in these appeals are:\nA. Whether 2467769 Ontario Inc. failed to report income arising from its operation of Osaka in the amounts of $221,953.40, $262,200.83, and $22,689.91 for the taxation years ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, respectively; B. Whether Ms. Qi received unreported benefits from 2467769 Ontario Inc. in the amounts of $167,204.90, $283,387.08, and $116,985.38 in her 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years, respectively and therefore was properly assessed under ss.15(1) of the Act; C. Whether 2467769 Ontario Inc. failed to collect and remit Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax due to unreported income in the amounts of $28,853.94, $35,476.11 and $2,949.69 for the reporting periods ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, respectively; D. Whether the Minister was entitled to reassess Ms. Qi for the 2015 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period; E. Whether Ms. Qi and 2467769 Ontario Inc. are liable for gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) of ITA and section 285 (only for 2467769 Ontario Inc.) of the ETA; F. Whether 2467769 Ontario Inc. is liable for electronic sales suppression penalties for the reporting period ending April 30, 2018 under subsection 163.3(2) of the ITA and subsection 285.01 (2) of the ETA; and, G. Whether Ms. Qi is entitled to GST\/HST credits for the periods at issue, pursuant to Part IX of the ETA. This appeared to have been plead by Ms. Qi in error. No evidence was lead or arguments made on this issue by either party. Therefore this component of the appeal will be denied without further mention; and, H. Whether this Court has the jurisdiction to determine Ms. Qi\u2019s eligibility for the Ontario Trillium Benefit (\u201cOTB\u201d). No evidence was led or arguments made on this issue by either party. The Tax Court does not have jurisdiction on this matter pursuant to subsection 103.2 of the Ontario Taxation Act, 2007, S.O. 2007, c.11. Sched. A (the \u201cOTA\u201d). Therefore this component of the appeal will be denied without further mention. II. FACTS [5] Despite the reassessments being for the fairly large amounts described in the above paragraphs, 2467769 Ontario Inc., chose to proceed by way of the informal rules.\n[6] Ms. Qi represented both herself and the corporation. While Ms. Qi made it clear in her testimony that she believed the various reassessments to be wrong, and stated that Osaka simply was not as successful as the Minister concluded, she failed to adduce any evidence concerning particular issues identified in the pleadings.\n[7] Ms. Qi incorporated 2467769 Ontario Inc. on May 25, 2015. 247769 Ontario Inc. purchased Osaka, a Japanese restaurant located in North York, in the summer of 2015.\n[8] Osaka was a full-service sushi restaurant and buffet serving alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and offered take-out and delivery through third-party applications such as Uber Eats, Just Eats, and Skip the Dishes.\n[9] During 2015, 2016, and 2017, Osaka underwent some changes under the direction of Ms. Qi, who was the new onsite manager. Ms. Qi had previously worked as a waitress and a kitchen helper in a restaurant and was familiar with how restaurants operate.\n[10] In 2015, 2016, and 2017, Osaka ran numerous promotions to attract new customers, based on a discount in return for a cash payment.\n[11] Ms. Qi\u2019s reported personal income for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxations years was as follows:\nTaxation Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\nMs. Qi Reported\nIncome\n$10,630 $9,333 $29,900\n$10,630 $9,333 $29,900\n[12] In 2015, 2016 and 2017, Ms. Qi paid for a mortgage, property taxes and various personal expenses.\n[13] Three witness testified at trial. Ms Qi testified on behalf of herself and 2467769 Ontario Inc. Two employees from CRA also testified. They were Ms. Melissa Singh (\u201cMs. Singh\u201d), an Income Tax auditor with CRA and Ms. Laura Craig (\u201cMs. Craig\u201d) a CRA Computer Audit Specialist, both of whom worked on the audit.\n[14] Ms. Craig and Ms. Singh walked the Court through the various steps they took in the audit of Osaka and Ms. Qi, the information they obtained, and the conclusions they drew from this information. I found their testimony to be very thorough and informative. They also performed corroborating steps, such as a net worth of Ms. Qi, to support their conclusions.\n(1) POS System [15] Osaka recorded sales electronically using a point of sale system and software called QuickPos (\u201cPOS\u201d). The POS tracks and records sales and other various data. The cash registers were closed at the end of each day and daily registry tapes were generated. POS tracked all sales entered in the system on a specific date by creating a unique transaction identification.\n[16] There was very little evidence on this point, but it appeared that most staff members had access to the POS system and could operate the POS machines, enter orders, and print bills.\n(2) The Audit Process Generally [17] I can do no better job in describing the audit steps taken then reproducing the description provided in the Respondent\u2019s written submission, which accurately reflected the mostly unchallenged evidence at trial. Many of these same facts are found in the assumption paragraphs in the Respondent\u2019s reply. In my decision I have therefore reproduced much of the description of the audit and the conclusions drawn from the Respondent\u2019s written submissions, as well as from the assumptions made by the Minister. I have made some additions specific to the evidence lead at trial.\n[18] Ms. Singh and Ms. Craig (\u201cthe Auditors\u201d), visited Osaka on a few occasions both separately and jointly, to obtain copies of the books and records of Osaka and to observe its daily operations.\n[19] They received a copies of Osaka\u2019s books and records and its Point of Sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) data as presented by Ms. Qi.\n[20] During the on-site observation days, the Auditors noted the number of employees who were present at the restaurant.\n[21] They also recorded all the transactions made at the restaurant on those days. Ms. Singh calculated the percentage of Osaka\u2019s cash sales during the observation days.\n[22] They determined that Osaka\u2019s books and records could not be relied upon to verify its reported income. This determination was reached on the following basis:\na)The POS data obtained from Osaka had anomalies that suggested that they were using sales suppression software to delete a percentage of cash sales;\nb)The CRA could not reconcile the number of Osaka\u2019s employees present at the restaurant with the wages and salaries reported by the restaurant; and\nc)Osaka\u2019s accountant did not have access to the source documents. The Appellants created an excel spreadsheet that they shared with their accountant to file their taxes.\n[23] As a result, the CRA resorted to the cash tender analysis to determine Osaka\u2019s income for each of the years at issue.\n[24] A cash tender analysis is an indirect verification method that assumes that the ratio of cash to non-cash sales of a business is constant. As such, if one can determine this ratio and the true amount of non-cash sales, then one can calculate the true amount of cash sales.\n[25] After conducting a cash tender analysis on Osaka\u2019s revenue, the CRA determined that it had failed to report all of its income in the taxation years at issue. The CRA also concluded that Osaka had conferred this unreported income to its sole shareholder, Ms. Qi.\n[26] Put in simplest terms, in their filings with the Minister for April 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, Osaka recorded 6% of all sales as being cash sales. The Minister determined that the correct figure was 24% of all sales in this time period as being in cash.\n(3) Osaka Sushi\u2019s Unreliable Books and Records [27] As previously stated, Osaka recorded its sales electronically using a POS system called QuickPOS. The POS tracked all sales entered in the system on a specific date by creating a unique transaction identification.\n[28] The Auditors conducted an unannounced site visit to the restaurant on May 10, 2018.\n[29] They chose May 10 as Osaka\u2019s taxation year and its GST\/HST yearly reporting period ended on April 30. The Auditors wanted to start the audit on a date close in time to 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s corporate year end and the end of its GST\/HST reporting period to preserve the POS data from potential manipulation.\n[30] During the initial visit, Ms. Craig copied the restaurant\u2019s POS system data for transactions from July 1, 2015 to May 9, 2018 from Osaka\u2019s server to its computer desktop, and then copied the original POS system data from the restaurant desktop. This is called the \u201cOriginal POS system data\u201d.\n[31] On May 17, 2018, Ms. Craig copied the closing reports from POS data to its desktop and then copied the data onto her USB. The closing reports were only available from February 1, 2016 going forward.\n[32] On September 7, 2018, Ms. Craig collected Osaka\u2019s POS system data for transactions from July 1, 2015 to September 6, 2018. This is called the \u201cRefresh POS system data.\u201d\n[33] Ms. Craig analyzed the point of sale databases and determined whether the data could be relied upon to determine Osaka\u2019s true income.\n(4) TXNIDs [34] The POS typically consists of a number of relationship databases or files that record information relevant to a restaurant\u2019s sales. This information can include: 1) the price of a transaction; 2) the payment method; 3) a customer profile; 4) any special orders (such as \u201cno added salt\u201d); 5) any voided transactions; 6) any transactions where a bill is being split; 7) orders that are being combined; and 8) any transactions where the table at which the clients are sitting is changing.\n[35] The POS system assigns a unique transaction ID (\u201cTXNID\u201d) for each transaction (including open, closed, voided and no sale transactions) in a sequential +1 algorithm (e.g. 1, 2, 3\u2026). Each TXNID is unique and cannot be duplicated.\n[36] Ms. Craig analysed the POS System Data obtained from Osaka and determined that 1) Osaka used this data to prepare its returns of income 2) the data could not be relied upon.\n[37] Ms. Craig found significant anomalies in the POS sales data and concluded it was likely to have been manipulated. Depending on the type of analysis, an anomaly can be:\na)A gap in the TXNIDs;\nb)A transaction with a TXNID that is improperly assigned;\nc)Discrepancies between the closing reports and POS data;\nd)A significant increase in cash sales after the audit started while no significant increase was identified in other sales trends; and,\ne)Printing the audit reports in large batches prior to the audit.\n(5) Gaps And Misassigned TXNIDs [38] When the TXNIDs were sorted by date, the TXNIDs in the POS system data were not sequential. For example:\nI. The TXNID \u201c10109\u201d was assigned to November 29, 2015;\nII. The TXNID \u201c10110\u201d was assigned to January 30, 2016;\nIII. The TXNID \u201c10814\u201d was assigned to February 11, 2016; and\nIV. The TXNID \u201c101815\u201d was assigned to December 13, 2015.\n[39] There were no TXNIDs for the dates from November 30, 2015 to December 12, 2015. Ms. Qi testified that this occurred because her internet was down for this period. Ms. Craig testified that the system does not run on the internet, so Ms. Qi\u2019s internet being down would not have caused this anomaly.\n(6) Discrepancies Between the Closing Reports and POS Data [40] At times in the Original POS system data, the data in the closing report for a particular date did not reconcile with the POS sales data for the same date \u2013 specifically, there were more sales on the closing reports than in the POS sales data.\n[41] Osaka periodically printed closing reports in batches.\n(7) Improper Records of Bank Deposits Were Maintained [42] Osaka did not maintain proper records of the disposition of the proceeds from its sales.\n[43] Osaka\u2019s sales were paid by either cash, debit card, or credit card (the debit card and credit card sales are hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cnon-cash sales\u201d).\n[44] All non-cash sales, as recorded on the POS system, were directly deposited into the Osaka\u2019s business bank account.\n[45] Cash generated from sales was deposited in their respective tills. At the end of each day, Ms. Qi or one of her employees closed the cash register by counting the amount of cash and putting cash sales in a box located at the restaurant.\n[46] Then Ms. Qi counted the amount of cash sales and used the cash to pay daily tips and remuneration to her employees and\/or to pay for Osaka\u2019s supplies. No records of the cash tips deposited into the box were maintained.\n[47] Next the remaining cash and the purchase invoices for expenses paid in cash were deposited in a safe located at the restaurant. On a rare occurrence the amount of cash in the box could exceed $20,000 or $30,000 and at such time Ms. Qi would deposit some cash in the bank since she did not feel safe keeping such high amounts of cash at the restaurant.\n[48] However, when asked during cross-examination to identify any instances of cash deposits in the bank records of 2467769 Ontario Inc., Ms. Qi was only able to point out one cash deposit made during the years before the court.\n[49] As an onsite manager, Ms. Qi had unlimited access to the cash box. The CRA determined that she used that money to pay for her personal expenses.\n[50] For the purpose of reporting Osaka\u2019s income and her personal income, Ms. Qi provided a manipulated version of Osaka\u2019s books and records to Turner Moore LLP, chartered accountants.\n[51] As such, the CRA concluded that it was not possible to audit the accuracy of any reported sales using Osaka\u2019s books and records.\n[52] Based on the observation days and during the observation months, Ms. Craig determined what percentage of sales were cash sales (the \u201cCash Percentage\u201d) for Osaka.\n[53] Ms. Craig\u2019s calculation of the Cash Percentage was significantly greater than the average derived from Osaka\u2019s books and records during the audit period.\n[54] Ms. Craig determined that there was a significant increase in cash sales from June 1, 2017 to September 6, 2018 in the POS system data, while there was no significant increase in sales from other means of payment, such as debit or credit.\n[55] It is the Minister\u2019s theory that the cash sales increased in this period because 2467769 Ontario Inc. did not yet have an opportunity to apply the suppression software to reduce the sales amounts in the books and records.\n[56] The auditors observed that before June 1, 2017, the average monthly cash sales were 6% based on the POS system date, while between June 1, 2017 and September 6, 2018, the average monthly cash sales was between 24% to 26% based on the POS system data.\n[57] Based upon their analysis of the other sales, and making the assumption that cash sales will remain a consistent percentage of the other sales, the Minister determined that Osaka had cash sales of 24% of overall sales for each of the years in question.\n[58] In order to determine the amount of HST\/GST that Osaka had failed to report, the amount of unreported income was added to Osaka\u2019s sales, as filed on its GST\/HST returns as income, in proportion to the percentage of sales in that reporting period.\n[59] This was in line with the percentage of cash sales calculated by Ms. Singh during the observation days and her review of tape collections.\n[60] Evidence was lead by the CRA to corroborate their findings. These were additional audit steps that did not form part of the reassessment, but instead were done in order to provide some peace of mind that the cash tender analyses reached a reasonable conclusion.\n[61] This was mainly by way of a net worth concerning Ms. Qi, which in broad terms, supported the assessment.\nIII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES (i) The Appellants [62] Ms. Qi\u2019s evidence was very limited. While she did testify, the focus of her testimony was that the POS was accurate, and to her knowledge, never altered. Furthermore, when questioned at to whether cash sales were under reported, she testified that this was not the case.\n[63] Ms. Qi also provided some testimony that she received loans from her family. She used these funds to pay for her lifestyle despite her lack of income. No particulars or details were provided as to who provided the funds, when they were provided, or in what amounts.\n[64] Concerning the missing sales transactions in the November 30 to December 12, 2015 time period, Ms. Qi testified that this occurred because her internet was not working. She provided no corroboration for this.\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s position on various issues (a) Unreported Sales [65] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the POS records for Osaka were manipulated to delete cash sales in the years before the court.\n[66] The Respondent submits that where the facts suggest a manipulation in POS data, the Minister is entitled to reassess the taxpayer using an arbitrary method under subsection 152(7).\n[67] The Respondent submits that reassessing 2467769 Ontario Inc. based on cash tender analysis is the appropriate methodology. The CRA also conducted separate analyses to provide verification that their audit methodology reached a reasonable sales figure.\n[68] A byproduct of this underreporting of income is that GST\/HST was under remitted in the amounts of $28,853.94, $35,476.11 and $2,949.69 for the reporting periods ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, respectively.\n(b) Shareholder Benefits [69] Ms. Qi was reassessed shareholder benefits on the basis of the 2467769 Ontario Inc. reassessment. The Respondent\u2019s position is that, based on the unreported income of Osaka, the lack of cash deposits into the corporate bank by the restaurant, the lack of any explanation as to where these funds went, and the net worth performed on Ms. Qi, it is appropriate to infer that Ms. Qi appropriated the funds from the cash sales.\n(c) Penalties [70] The Respondent submits that the manipulation of the POS data was done at the direction of Ms. Qi to delete cash sales. As such, 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s income tax returns filed for 2016, 2017 and 2018 contained false statements under reporting sales. Furthermore, Ms. Qi knowingly underreported her income in her filings for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years. Penalties pursuant to both the ITA and the ETA for Ms. Qi, and 2467769 Ontario Inc. were therefore correctly assessed.\n[71] Furthermore, the Respondent submits that sufficient evidence exists to support the conclusion that electronic sales suppression software was used to delete cash sales from Osaka\u2019s records. Therefore additional penalties were properly assessed in this regard.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Unreported income of 2467769 Ontario Inc. and unremitted GST\/HST\n[72] Under subsection 152(7) of the ITA, the Minister is not bound by a return or information supplied by a taxpayer and may assess the taxpayer using any method that is appropriate in the circumstances. Subsection 152(8) of the ITA sets out that these assessments are deemed to be valid. The onus is therefore upon the taxpayer to disprove the assumptions of the Minister by making out a prima facie case. Once the Minister's assumptions have been \u201cdemolished\u201d, the onus shifts to the Minister to rebut the prima facie case made out by the taxpayer and to prove the assumptions.[1]\n[73] As was stated by Justice Bocock[2] of this Court, no better a statement on the issue of burden and onus concerning arbitrary assessments has been made since President Thorson of the Exchequer Court in the case of Dezura v. Minister of National Revenue (1947), [1948] Ex. C.R. 10 (Can. Ex. Ct.) stated:\nThe object of an assessment is the ascertainment of the amount of the taxpayer's taxable income and the fixation of his liability in accordance with the provisions of the Act. If the taxpayer makes no return or gives incorrect information either in his return or otherwise he can have no just cause for complaint on the ground that the Minister has determined the amount of tax he ought to pay provided he has a right of appeal therefrom and is given an opportunity of showing that the amount determined by the Minister is incorrect in fact. [...] Ordinarily, the taxpayer knows better than anyone else the amount of his taxable income and should be able to prove it to the satisfaction of the Court. [...] If, on the other hand, he fails to show that the amount determined by the Minister is erroneous, he cannot justly complain if the amount stands.\n[74] In Bousfield v. The King,[3] the Tax Court of Canada explained in detail how a taxpayer can rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption in a case such as this:\n\u201cWhen the Minister determines a taxpayer\u2019s income or revenue using an alternative assessment technique, the taxpayer can win:\na) by showing that the taxpayer\u2019s income or revenue can be more accurately calculated using the taxpayer\u2019s own books and records;\nb) by accepting that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister is appropriate by attacking components of the calculation in an effort to reduce the income or revenue;\nc) if the year in question is statute-barred, by showing that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister is fundamentally flawed;\nd) by presenting a different alternative assessment technique that more accurately calculates the taxpayer\u2019s income or revenue; or\ne) by accepting that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister was appropriate but showing that the income or revenue calculated by the technique was from a non-taxable source.\u201d\n[75] As such, Ms. Qi would have been able to undermine the Minister\u2019s reassessment by employing any of the options above. While she did provide some financial records she prepared herself, these records had no corroboration. I do not accept them to be an accurate reflection of Osaka\u2019s business.\n[76] As noted above, the Minister did not simply rely upon the assumptions made. They called two CRA employees with knowledge of the audit and the conclusions made to explain: (i) why Osaka was audited; (ii) the various audit steps, and (iii) the conclusions reached. Based on this uncontradicted evidence, I accept that 2467760 Ontario Inc. used software to suppress cash sales (the reasons for my conclusion regarding the use of suppression software is expanded upon further in the decision) and under report overall income in their corporate tax filings. Cash sales were 24% of all of Osaka\u2019s sales, not the 6% reported in tax filings.\n[77] I therefore conclude that the ITA assessment concerning 2467769 Ontario Inc. is correct. The assumptions as made stand. I accept that 2467769 Ontario Inc. failed to report income arising from its operation of Osaka in the amounts of $221,953.40, $262,200.83, and $22,689.91 for the taxation years ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, respectively.\n[78] Given that I have found that the above income tax reassessments to be correct concerning 2467769 Ontario Inc., I also find that 2467769 Ontario Inc. failed to collect and remit Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax due to unreported sales in the amounts of $28,853.94, $35,476.11 and $2,949.69 for the reporting periods ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018. The reporting period covered by the GST\/HST audit does match the reporting period covered by ITA audit. All adjustments to the GST\/HST filing were consequential to the adjustments on the ITA audit.\nB. Statue barred 2015 year for Ms. Qi\n[79] Concerning the 2015 taxation year, the year was statue barred at the time of Ms. Qi\u2019s reassessment. Ms. Qi was reassessed for receiving shareholder benefits of $167,204.90 in 2015.\n[80] In this instance the Respondent has the burden of proving that Ms. Qi had unreported income or revenue. In doing so, the Minister must establish Ms. Qi made misrepresentations in her filings attributable to neglect, carelessness, or wilful default, justifying reassessments made after the normal reassessment period as set out at s. 152(4)(a)(i) of ITA.\n[81] In this particular circumstance, if I were to find that the alternative assessment technique used by the Minister was fundamentally flawed in 2015, then the Respondent would not meet their burden. I have not made such a finding.\n[82] In the 2015 taxation year, Ms. Qi reported personal income of $10,620. She did not present evidence as to how she lived on such minimal income while she paid her mortgage, property tax, and numerous other life expenses. During the course of trial, Ms. Qi did testify that, in 2015, 2016 and 2017 she received loans from family and friends. However, this evidence was vague and totally lacking in detail. This evidence only confirmed for me that Ms. Qi had unreported income in 2015 and did not provide a credible explanation as to its source.\n[83] Furthermore the Minister has presented reliable evidence to show that 2467769 Ontario Inc. under reported its income in 2015.\n[84] Ms. Qi is the sole shareholder of 2467769 Ontario Inc. The evidence indicated that she provided what I accept was altered sales information to 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s accountant for tax filing purposes in all the years before the Court and that she used the under reported cash sales for her own benefit. She knew in 2015 that she was under reporting her income in her tax filings. I therefore accept that, in filing her 2015 taxation return, Ms. Qi wilfully made misrepresentations in understating her income. I find that the Minister has satisfied his onus in order to reopen the 2015 taxation year to reassess Ms. Qi.[4]\nC. Ms. Qi appropriated the Company\u2019s unreported revenue and unreported income\n[85] The Minister\u2019s assumptions include the following:\n(i) The Company conferred benefits on the Appellant in her capacity as a shareholder of the Company in the aggregate amount of no less than the appropriated unreported income and unreported GST\/HST collected of the company; (ii) The Appellant received benefits of not less than the appropriated unreported income and unreported GST\/HST collected of the Company; and (iii) The Appellant failed to include the Shareholder Benefits conferred in computing her income for the relevant years. [86] As noted the Minister also performed a net worth on the Appellant, not as part of a conclusion for the reassessment, but instead as a form of corroboration for the above assumptions.\n[87] The overall results of the net worth was consistent with the reassessment. In response, as already referenced, Ms. Qi provided oral evidence that she received money from family and friends in the years under audit. No further details or evidence was provided.\n[88] The unreported income not finding its way to 2467769 Ontario Inc. implies strongly that the controlling party of 2467769 Ontario Inc., namely Ms. Qi, received it.\n[89] The Minister\u2019s assumptions were not challenged by Ms. Qi. The Appellants offered no evidence (other than as described in paragraph 75 of this decision) that the assessed unreported income was incorrect or that the cash sales income in issue was not received by her. As such, the Court has no factual basis before it to conclude the Minister's assumptions are incorrect. The shareholder benefits assessment must stand.\n[90] Furthermore, even without referring to the assumptions, the Respondent lead compelling evidence for each of the 2015, 2016, and 2017 taxation years that Ms. Qi had unreported income in the amounts assessed. This evidence includes the net worth as well as the evidence that substantial cash sales were unreported, and the cash was never deposited into the corporate bank account. In these circumstances, without any contradictory evidence from M. Qi, it is a reasonable conclusion that she appropriated the cash sales for her own benefit. I therefore must deny Ms. Qi\u2019s appeal concerning unreported income for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years.\nD. Penalties\n[91] A taxpayer is liable for a penalty under subsection 163(2) of the ITA where the taxpayer has knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, made or participated in, assented to, or acquiesced in, the making of a false statement or omission in an income tax return (the same test applies under 285 of the ETA). The Respondent bears the onus of establishing that the conditions under subsection 163(2) of the ITA and 285 of the ETA are met.\n[92] The Respondent relies upon the FCA decision of Lacroix[5], wherein the court sets out the process of considering gross negligence penalties when it comes to alternative assessment techniques:\n29. \u201c\u2026In the case at bar, the Minister found undeclared income and asked the taxpayer to justify it. The taxpayer provided an explanation that neither the Minister nor the Tax Court of Canada found to be credible. Accordingly, there is no viable and reasonable hypothesis that could lead the decision-maker to give the taxpayer the benefit of the doubt. The only hypothesis offered was deemed not to be credible.\n30. The facts in evidence in this case are such that the taxpayer\u2019s tax return made a misrepresentation of facts, and the only explanation offered by the taxpayer was found not to be credible. Clearly, there must be some other explanation for this income. It must therefore be concluded that the taxpayer had an unreported source of income, was aware of this source and refused to disclose it, since the explanations he gave were found not to be credible. In my view, given such circumstances, one must come to the inevitable conclusion that the false tax return was filed knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence. This justifies not only a penalty, but also a reassessment beyond the statutory period.\u201d\n[93] While this analysis is helpful and applicable, in relying upon Lacroix I must also consider the more recent FCA decision in Deyab[6] in which Justice Webb stated at paragraph 65:\n65. Simply finding that an unreported amount is taxable does not inevitably lead to a conclusion that a gross negligence penalty is justified. The Tax Court Judge effectively equated the test for determining whether a gross negligence penalty should be assessed with the test for determining whether the amounts were taxable. \u2026\n66. The right to reassess a statute-barred year and the right to assess a gross negligence penalty are both premised on a taxpayer having unreported income for a particular taxation year. Once it has been established that a taxpayer had unreported income, the circumstances related to the failure to report the income must be examined to determine if such failure was attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful default or fraud (to reassess a statute-barred year) or gross negligence (to justify the assessment of the gross negligence penalty).\n\u2026\n74. In Lacroix, at paragraph 28, this Court quoted the following passage from the decision of Justice Bowman in Farm Business Consultants Inc. v. R., [1994] 2 C.T.C. 2450, 95 D.T.C. 200 (T.C.C.) :\n27 A court must be extremely cautious in sanctioning the imposition of penalties under subsection 163(2). Conduct that warrants reopening a statute-barred year does not automatically justify a penalty and the routine imposition of penalties by the Minister is to be discouraged.... Moreover, where a penalty is imposed under subsection 163(2) although a civil standard of proof is required, if a taxpayer's conduct is consistent with two viable and reasonable hypotheses, one justifying the penalty and one not, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the taxpayer and the penalty must be deleted...\n[94] With these cases in mind, as well as the analysis provided in Wood v. the Queen (2020) CCI 87, I do find that the gross negligence penalties were properly assessed.\n[95] The factors I have considered in upholding the penalty assessments are that Ms. Qi played an active role in understating Osaka\u2019s sales. This includes providing 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s accountant with incorrect sales information. I also have concluded that she appropriated the understated cash sales from Osaka, for her own benefit, yet never declared these amounts in her Income Tax filings. On this basis, I find the 163(2) penalty assessment against Ms. Qi is correctly assessed.\n[96] I also rely upon the fact that there is evidence of data manipulation, which suppressed the cash sales of Osaka. Ms. Qi, who had full control of the POS system and is certainly the person responsible for this manipulation, did this in her capacity as sole shareholder of 2467769 Ontario Inc. This lead to the suppression of income and the filing of understated T2 returns and improper GST\/HST remittances by 2467769 Ontario Inc. On this basis I uphold the ss. 163(2) (of the ITA) and s. 285 (of the ETA) penalties assessed to 2467769 Ontario Inc.\nE. Zapper penalties\n[97] 2467769 Ontario Inc. has been assessed penalties under section 163.2(2) of the ITA and s. 285.01 of the ETA, for the use of electronic suppression of sales device. By assessing penalties under both the ITA and the ETA, this in effect doubles the penalty from $5000 to $10,000. Both the ITA and the ETA rely upon basically the same wording:\n163.2 Penalty \u2014 use\n(2) Every person that uses, or that knowingly, or under circumstances attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default, participates in, assents to or acquiesces in the use of, an electronic suppression of sales device or a similar device or software in relation to records that are required to be kept by any person under section 230 is liable to a penalty of\n(a) unless paragraph (b) applies, $5,000; or\n(b) $50,000 if the action of the person occurs after the Minister has assessed a penalty payable by the person under this section or section 285.01 of the Excise Tax Act.\n[98] The onus is on the Respondent to support this penalty. Once again, a civil standard of proof, the balance of probabilities, applies. Additionally, the due diligence defence is not available to a taxpayer subject to those penalties, as per 285.01(6) of the ETA and 163.3(7) of the ITA.\n[99] There is no legal precedent on point.[7]\n[100] When asked how they intended to prove that a suppression of sales device was used, the following exchange occurred with the Respondent:\nJUSTICE: You did. I'm \u2011- I'm just wondering, does this phantom software or these other methodologies to manipulate data, do they leave a fingerprint of some sort where you can tell it's happened?\nA I would say that the anomalies found in this transaction ID analysis are exactly that fingerprint.[8]\n[101] The anomalies in the system, for which much evidence was called by the Respondent, were as follows:\na)Gaps in the TXNIDs; and,\nb)A transaction with a TXNID that is improperly assigned; and,\nc)Discrepancies between the closing reports and POS data; and,\nd)A significant increase in cash sales after the audit started while no significant increase was identified in other sales trends; and,\ne)Printing the audit reports in large batches prior to the audit; and,\nf)No transactions between November 30th and December 12th, 2015.\n[102] For me, the most pertinent of these examples are the TXNID being out of sequence, and the missing sales data for transactions between November 30th and December 12th, 2015. The other examples provided by the Respondent also supported their case that suppression software was used.\n[103] There was no response from the Appellant to either challenge or explain these anomalies.\n[104] I do therefore find that the Respondent has shown, on the balance of probabilities that the corporate Appellant, 2467769 Ontario Inc. has knowingly, or under circumstances attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default, participates in, assents to or acquiesces in the use of, an electronic suppression of sales device.\nV. CONCLUSION [105] Based on all the foregoing:\nA. 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s appeal of the reassessment that it failed to report income arising from its operation of Osaka in the amounts of $221,953.40, $262,200.83, and $22,689.91 for the taxation years ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, is denied; and, B. Ms. Qi\u2019s appeal of the assessment that she received unreported benefits from 2467769 Ontario Inc. in the amounts of $167,204.90, $283,387.08, and $116,985.38 in her 2015, 2016 and 2017 taxation years, respectively and therefore was properly reassessed under ss.15(1) of the ITA is denied; and, C. 2467769 Ontario Inc.\u2019s appeal of the reassessment that it failed to collect and remit Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax due to unreported income in the amounts of $28,853.94, $35,476.11 and $2,949.69 for the reporting periods ending April 30, 2016, April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, is denied; and, D. The Minister was entitled to reassess Ms. Qi for the 2015 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period; and, E. Ms. Qi and 2467769 Ontario Inc. are liable for gross negligence penalties under subsection 163(2) of the ITA and section 285 (only for 2467769 Ontario Inc.) of the ETA; and, F. 2467769 Ontario Inc. is liable for electronic sales suppression penalties for the reporting period ending April 30, 2018 under subsection 163.3(2) of the ITA and subsection 285.01 (2) of the ETA; and, G. Ms. Qi\u2019s appeal that she is entitled to GST\/HST credits for the periods at issue, pursuant to Part IX of the ETA is denied; and, H. This Court does not have the jurisdiction to determine Ms. Qi\u2019s eligibility for the Ontario Trillium Benefit (\u201cOTB\u201d) pursuant to subsection 103.2 of the Ontario Taxation Act, 2007, S.O. 2007, c.11. Sched. A (the \u201cOTA\u201d); and, I. One set of costs is rewarded to the Respondent in respect of the trial and the various disbursements incurred.

Facts in Brief\n[1] The Appellant, Active Asset Management Inc. (\u201cAAM\u201d), was reassessed under subsection 160(1) of the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d) on April 5, 2018 identified as control # 47123 (the \u201cs.160 Assessment\u201d).\n[2] As of December 31, 2004, Bakorp Inc. (\u201cBakorp\u201d), the principal taxpayer, owed $11,983,406.55 taxes and penalties (the \u201ctax liability\u201d).\nDeemed dividends\n[3] The shareholder of Bakorp resolved on December 1, 2004, to increase the stated capital of its Class A shares by $30,041,400.07 resulting in a deemed dividend of $30,041,400.07 to AAM (the \u201cClass A deemed dividend\u201d). As well, Bakorp resolved December 1, 2004, to increase the stated capital of its Class B shares by $34,958,599.92, resulting in a deemed dividend of $34,958,599.92 to AAM (the \u201cClass B deemed dividend\u201d) (collectively the \u201cdeemed dividends\u201d).\nDeclared dividends\n[4] By director\u2019s resolution dated December 1, 2004, Bakorp declared a dividend of $29,194.58 per share on the issued and outstanding Class A shares in its capital, resulting in a declaration of aggregate dividends of $35,850,944.67 to AAM (the \u201cClass A declared dividends\u201d). As well, Bakorp resolved December 1, 2004, to declare a dividend of $29,194.58 per share on the issued and outstanding Class B shares, resulting in a declaration of aggregate dividends of $41,719,055.32 to the Appellant (the \u201cClass B declared dividends\u201d) (collectively the \u201cdeclared dividends\u201d.\nPromissory notes\n[5] On December 1, 2004, Bakorp issued a promissory note, due upon demand, to AAM in the amount of $35,850,944.67 in respect of the Class A declared dividends (the \u201cClass A promissory note\u201d).\n[6] On December 1, 2004, Bakorp issued a promissory note, due upon demand, to AAM in the amount of $41,719,055.32 in respect of the Class B Declared Dividends (the \u201cClass B promissory note\u201d).\n[7] Bakorp has neither paid, nor has AAM ever demanded payment of the amounts owing under the Class A promissory note or the Class B promissory note (collectively the \u201cpromissory notes\u201d).\nTax returns reflect dividends\n[8] In filing its T2 Corporation Income Tax Return for the taxation year ending October 31, 2005, AAM reported the amount of $142,570,000 (representing the cumulative total of the Class A deemed dividend, the Class B deemed dividend, the Class A declared dividends and the Class B declared dividends) on line 250 of its return.\nAssessment raised\n[9] By issuing the s.160 Assessment, the Minister assessed AAM for its joint liability under subsection 160(1) of the ITA in the amount of $20,304,746.00.\n[10] As referenced in the s.160 Assessment, \u201c[t]he liability under subsection 160(1) of the Income Tax Act, in the amount of $20,304,746.00, is in respect of a transfer on or about December 31, 2004 from [Bakorp] to [AAM] of assets in the form of dividends.\u201d\nAssessment reduced after objection\n[11] After objection by AAM, the s.160 Assessment, dated April 15, 2018, was reduced. AAM\u2019s liability under subsection 160(1) of the ITA became $11,983,407.00. The s.160 Reassessment (the \u201cs.160 Reassessment\u201d). provided that \u201c[t]his reassessment provides for a decrease to the liability of the previously issued assessment bearing control #41920 issued on March 24, 2006.\u201d\n[12] The.160 Reassessment was objected to and successfully confirmed. It is the operative s.160 Reassessment before the Court and the subject of this appeal.\nII. Issues\nThe issues are clear and succinct\n[13] There are two issues before the Court. Does either:\n(1) The increase to Bakorp\u2019s stated capital which yielded the deemed dividends; and\/or,\n(2) the declaration of the declared dividends and\/or the issuance of the promissory notes;\nconstitute a transfer of property, such that subsection 160(1) of the ITA is engaged and thereby makes AAM liable for Bakorp\u2019s tax liability?\nIII. Section 160 Itself\n[14] Subsection 160(1) is triggered when a person transfers property to a non-arm\u2019s length person (for which there is no consideration tendered) where the transferor is a tax debtor at the time of the transfer.[1] Subsection 160(1) applies whether or not the transferor or the transferee were aware of the tax liability at the time of the transfer.[2]\n160 (0.1) In this section \u2026 a transaction includes an arrangement or event.\nTax liability re property transferred not at arm\u2019s length\nWhere a person has\u2026 transferred property either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to\n\u2026\n(c) a person with whom the person was not dealing at arm\u2019s length,\nthe following rules apply\n\u2026\n(e) the transferee and transferor are \u2026 liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of:\n(i) the amount\u2026 by which the fair market value of the property \u2026 exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property, and\n(ii) the total of all amounts \u2026 the transferor is liable to pay under this Act \u2026 in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year.\n[15] The components of s.160 jurisprudence provide that the following four cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in order to engage subsection 160(1) and thereby impose a transferor\u2019s outstanding tax liability onto a transferee:\n(1) The transferor must be liable to pay a tax under the ITA at the time of transfer;\n(2) There must be a transfer of property;\n(3) The transferee must be a person with whom the transferor was not dealing at arm\u2019s length or to an otherwise designated transferee; and,\n(4) The fair market value of the property transferred must exceed the fair market value of the consideration given by the transferee for the property.[3]\n[16] The only component at issue before the Court in this appeal is whether subparagraph (2) above: a transfer of property has occurred. For there to be a transfer of property for the purpose of subsection 160(1) \u201cit is essential that the transferor be divested of his ownership and that the property [vests] in the transferee.\u201d[4]\nDividends generally\n[17] Generally, dividends, when declared and paid, are amounts paid to shareholders as a recognition of a return on their investment in a corporation proportionate to their shareholdings.[5] This Court in Gosselin[6] outlined the consequential effect of declaring a dividend:\n\u201cThe declaration of a dividend is essentially the allocation of a company's undistributed profits to its shareholders in proportion to the shares held by them and in accordance with the rights attached to those shares. Payment of the dividend is the act by which the dividends so allocated by the directors in their discretion, and in compliance with the principles of company law and the specific rules laid down in this regard, distribute to the shareholders the dividend allocated to each class of shares.\u201d\nDeemed dividends specifically\n[18] Contrastingly, a deemed dividend can occur when there is not a declaration and\/or a direct payment or transfer from a corporation to a shareholder. Subsection 84(1) of the ITA outlines the definition and operation of deemed dividends:\nDeemed Dividend\n84(1) Where a corporation resident in Canada has \u2026 increased the paid-up capital in respect of the shares of any particular class of its capital stock, otherwise than by\n\u2026 [not applicable]\nthe corporation shall be deemed to have paid at that time a dividend on the issued shares of the particular class equal to the amount, if any, by which the amount of the increase in the paid-up capital exceeds the total of\n(d) the amount, if any, of the increase referred to in subparagraph 84(1)(b)(i) or the decrease referred to in subparagraph 84(1)(b)(ii), as the case may be,\n(e) the amount, if any, of the reduction referred to in paragraph 84(1)(c), and\n(f) the amount, if any, of the increase in the paid-up capital that resulted from a conversion referred to in paragraph 84(1)(c.1), (c.2) or (c.3),\nand a dividend shall be deemed to have been received at that time by each person who held any of the issued shares of the particular class immediately after that time equal to that proportion of the dividend so deemed to have been paid by the corporation that the number of the shares of the particular class held by the person immediately after that time is of the number of the issued shares of that class outstanding immediately after that time. [my emphasis]\n[19] For the purposes of income inclusion under the ITA, if a corporation increases the paid-up capital of a particular class of shares, the corporation will be deemed to have paid the shareholders of that particular class of shares a dividend. Correspondingly, the shareholders of that particular class of shares will be deemed to have received a dividend from the corporation.\n[20] This Court in McClarty Family Trust[7] outlined the purpose of deemed dividends pursuant to section 84 of the ITA:\n\u201cThe purpose of section 84 of the ITA, in general terms, is to deem certain events that are not payments of dividends in corporate law to be payments of dividends for tax purposes\u201d[8]\n[21] Subsection 84(1) operates to render the tax treatment of dividends and deemed dividends identically. Provided the conditions under subsection 84(1) are met, namely an increase in the paid-up capital of a class of shares, a corporation will be deemed to have paid, and a shareholder will be deemed to have received a dividend for tax purposes.\n[22] A dividend which is declared and paid constitutes an actual transfer of property from a corporation to a shareholder in recognition of the shareholder\u2019s contribution to the corporation and ownership of shares, whereas a deemed dividend is a recognition of an increase in value of a shareholder\u2019s ownership of shares. However, subsection 84(1) operates to impose the same income and tax treatment on these otherwise distinct factual situations.\nIV. Analysis\n[23] Both counsel agree that the sole issue before the Court is whether there was a transfer of property from Bakorp to AAM. This pre-condition of transfer will determine whether s.160 applies to either of the deemed dividends or the declared dividends.\n(a) The deemed dividends [24] For a transfer of property to have occurred within the ambit of s.160, the parties also agree an enrichment need be conferred on the recipient and a concordant impoverishment settled upon the grantor.[9]\n[25] In submissions, the Court asked Respondent\u2019s counsel to identify the enrichment and impoverishment in the context of the deemed dividends. Respondent\u2019s counsel contends that AAM\u2019s (qua shareholder\u2019s) receipt of the appreciation of its stated capital value ascribable to the deemed dividends in an enrichment. Bakorp was impoverished because \u201cfunds\u201d reflecting such enrichment were no longer available to Bakorp for other purposes.\n[26] The Court disagrees. The deemed dividends burdened no impoverishment. Bakorp paid no funds whatsoever, it incurred no liability and it reflected no transfer. It simply took its recorded retained earnings and re-characterized them as appreciated stated capital to the lawful owner: the shareholder of record.\n[27] Regarding enrichment, the Court finds the change as non-tangible as it did the impoverishment. AAM has the same number of shares, it simply has a revised stated (or recorded) value. Notionally, AAM can now say its shares reflect a different stated value, but not a penny has been received by it as a consequence of the deemed dividend.\n[28] As importantly, the mischief targeted by s.160 , avoidance of payment of a tax debt to the Crown, has also not occurred. The \u201cfunds\u201d available to Bakorp have not changed in the slightest. Its bank account, working capital, other assets and reserves have not been depleted in any way by the increase to stated capital or declaration of the deemed dividend.\n[29] For these reasons, s.160 does not apply to the deemed dividends because their accrual to AAM is not a transfer of property under s.160 of the ITA.\n(b) The declared dividends [30] The Respondent asserts that the payment of declared dividends is a transfer of property \u201cbased upon the authorities\u201d. It is easily envisaged that a corporation may use declared dividends to divest its assets and avoid paying its tax otherwise owing.[10] Because there is no consideration tendered by AAM for such declared dividends, receipt of the declared dividends may attract applicability of s.160.[11]\n[31] Further, the Respondent, distinctly from the deemed dividends submissions, identifies further evidence of transfer of property. Counsel identifies three circumstantial hallmarks of a transfer:\n(i) the delivery of the promissory notes payable on demand which demand may be asserted on the date of making; (ii) the recording of the declared dividend as taxable and payment of the tax by AAM; and, (iii) the assumption by Bakorp of the obligation reflected by the promissory notes. [32] When pressed, counsel said the promissory notes, together with the recordal and assumption of the debt by Bakorp evidenced by the promissory notes, constitute a transfer of property because AAM was enriched and Bakorp was impoverished by virtue of these \u201ccircumstances\u201d.\n[33] Logic demolishes these notions of a transfer of property. The promissory notes are evidence of debt. Their very existence belies that any payment of cash or transfer of assets in kind (securities, bonds or even shares) occurred. Subsequent payments, once made, factually denote transfers of property. The fact that the promissory notes exist is emblematic that no such payment or transfer of property has been made. Similarly, the promissory note is not payable until demand is made. Demand has not been made. Even then, upon such demand and presentment being made, no transfer would occur until payment, in cash or in kind, actually occurs.\n[34] The accrual and payment of the declared dividend for tax purposes is just that, a requirement under the ITA to record and include the dividend in income, irrespective and despite no corresponding, but anticipated, transfer of property (payment) having been made.\n[35] Lastly, no funds, resources or assets of Bakorp concerning the declared dividends or promissory notes enriched AAM or were foreborn by Bakorp to impoverish it. It has recorded a contingent liability, becoming due and payable upon demand. This final point goes to the heart of the s.160 targeted mischief. Where and how has Bakorp transferred, dissipated or surrendered control of its assets, funds or property to circumvent the payment of its tax liability.[12] It has not in any way done so. No assets or funds of Bakorp, consequentially arising from the declaration of the declared dividends or making of the promissory notes, reside with AAM.\n[36] At some point in the future perhaps, and upon demand by AAM under the promissory notes and payment to it, a transfer of property may occur. Speculatively, such an event would, factually at least, constitute a transfer of property. At best, and until then, the Minister\u2019s assessment of AAM under s.160 is premature.\nV. Conclusions\n[37] The appeal is allowed. All section consequential 160 assessments and reassessments against AAM are vacated.\n[38] Costs are awarded to AAM subject to further rights of submissions contained in the actual signed judgment. The Appellant shall provide its written submissions within 30 days, not to exceed 10 pages. The Respondent shall have a further 30 days for any responding submissions.\nSigned at Ottawa, Ontario, this 14th day of June 2024.\n\u201cR. S.

Introduction [1] Maria Csak (the \u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals an assessment in the amount of $1,200,000 made by the Minister of National Revenue (the \u201cMinister\u201d) under section 160 of the Income Tax Act[1] (the \u201cITA\u201d) by notice dated August 14, 2012 (the \u201cAssessment\u201d).\n[2] The basis of the Assessment is that the Appellant\u2019s deceased spouse, Charles Csak (\u201cCC\u201d), transferred a property to the Appellant having a fair market value of $1,200,000 at a time when CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 through 1991 taxation years totalled $536,625 plus accrued interest.[2] The Appellant married CC in October 1992, the transfer of property occurred on January 8, 1993 and CC passed away on March 9, 2002.\nII. The Facts A. The Minister\u2019s Assumptions of Fact [3] In determining the Appellant\u2019s liability pursuant to subsection 160(1) of the ITA, the Minister made the following assumptions of fact:\na) On January 8, 1993, Charles Csak transferred [a property located at 7286 Tenth Line, Mississauga, Ontario (the \u201cProperty\u201d)] [3] to the Appellant;\nb) The Appellant and Charles Csak were married as at [January 8, 1993];\nc) No consideration passed from the Appellant to Charles Csak in connection with the transfer of the Property as the transfer was for \u201cnatural love and affection\u201d;\nd) The fair market value of the Property as at [January 8, 1993] was $1,200,000;\ne) Charles Csak died on or about March 9, 2002;\nf) After the death of Charles Csak, the Appellant was executrix and\/or trustee of his estate;\ng) As at August 14, 2012, the Estate of the Late Charles Csak\u2019s unpaid tax liability under the [Income Tax Act], Income Tax Act (Ontario), including interest, in respect of taxation years prior to [January 8, 1993], was as follows;[4]\nThe Underlying Assessments\nh) Charles Csak was reassessed for the 1988, 1989, 1990 taxation years on April 21, 1994; and reassessed for the 1991 taxation year on August 15, 1994 (the \u201cUnderlying Assessments\u201d);\ni) The Underlying Assessments concerned partnership losses claimed by Charles Csak which were disallowed by the Minister;\nj) In 1996, Charles Csak, along with other persons involved in the same partnership(s), filed an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada from the Underlying Assessments;\nk) The Appellant as executrix and\/or trustee of Charles Csak\u2019s estate pursued and directed the appeal to the Tax Court of Canada following his death;\nl) [Withdrawn by counsel for the Respondent at the hearing of the appeal];\nm) The Appellant was a beneficiary of the Estate of the Late Charles Csak;\nn) On July 13, 2006, Chief Justice Bowman of [sic] Tax Court of Canada issued judgment dismissing the Estate of the Late Charles Csak\u2019s appeal of the Underlying Assessments;\no) The tax liability of the Estate of the Late Charles Csak of $4,876,825 remains outstanding;\nThe Waivers\np) Charles Csak executed a waiver of the normal reassessment period for the 1988 taxation year on September 10, 1992, which was mailed to the Minister on September 11, 1992, and received on September 14, 1992; and\nq) Charles Csak executed a waiver of the normal reassessment period for the 1989 taxation year on May 27, 1993, which was mailed to the Minister on May 27, 1993, and received on May 31, 1993.[5]\nB. Facts Admitted in the Pleadings [4] In paragraph 1 of the Amended Reply, the Respondent admits the facts stated in paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Notice of Appeal, which state:\n14. Charles was originally assessed for the 1988 to 1991 tax years on the following dates:\n(a) September 20, 1989 (Re: 1988).\n(b) May 30, 1990 (Re: 1989).\n(c) November 8, 1991 (Re: 1990).\n(d) October 9, 1992 (Re: 1991).\n15. The CRA reassessed Charles for the years 1988 to 1991 on the following dates (collectively, the \u201cUnderlying Transferor Reassessments\u201d):\n(a) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1988) (the \u201c1988 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(b) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1989) (the \u201c1989 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(c) April 21, 1994 (Re: 1990) (the \u201c1990 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n(d) August 15, 1994 (Re: 1991) (the \u201c1991 Transferor Reassessment\u201d).\n[5] In paragraph 3 of the Amended Reply, the Respondent admits that CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years were reassessed by the 1988 Transferor Reassessment and the 1989 Transferor Reassessment after the normal reassessment period for those taxation years. I will refer to the 1988 Transferor Reassessment and the 1989 Transferor Reassessment, collectively, as the \u201cDisputed CC Reassessments\u201d.\nC. The Partial Agreed Statement of Facts [6] The parties submitted a partial agreed statement of facts (the \u201cPASF\u201d) together with the documents referred to in the PASF (the \u201cJoint Book\u201d). A copy of the PASF is attached to these reasons as Appendix A.\n[7] The parties agree that the fair market value of the Property at the time of the transfer of the Property on January 8, 1993 was $950,000. The parties also agree that the normal reassessment periods for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years expired on September 20, 1992 and May 30, 1993, respectively.\nD. The Evidence of the Witnesses [8] The Appellant testified on her own behalf.\n[9] The Respondent called two witnesses:\nA. Mr. Azharul Hassan, currently a team leader in revenue collections at the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d) and formerly a collections officer at the CRA; and\nB. Mr. John Hussey, currently the Assistant Director of Administration for the Greater Toronto Area at the CRA.\n[10] I found all of the witnesses to be credible.\n[11] The Appellant testified that she disagreed with the assumptions of fact stated in paragraphs 11(c), (k) and (m) of the Amended Reply.\n[12] With respect to paragraph 11(c) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant testified that she had given consideration for the Property consisting of her agreement to marry CC and her agreement to care for CC. The Appellant described her agreement to marry CC as the more serious consideration for her.\n[13] Regarding the agreement to marry, the Appellant explained that she had planned to marry CC in 1988 or 1989, but that CC had married another woman (the \u201cFormer CC Spouse\u201d) in July 1989 without the Appellant\u2019s knowledge.\n[14] The Former CC Spouse left CC after a couple of days and moved to Europe. This turn of events soured the Appellant\u2019s relationship with CC for a few months, but the relationship resumed in late 1989.\n[15] CC obtained a divorce from the Former CC Spouse around 1991. However, the Appellant had lingering concerns that CC might \u201cdouble cross\u201d her again and that the Former CC Spouse would return and make a claim over CC\u2019s home (i.e., the Property). The Appellant advised CC that she would not marry him unless he transferred his home to her.\n[16] The Appellant and CC were married in October 1992 and the Property was transferred to the Appellant on January 8, 1993. In cross-examination, the Appellant stated that she and CC had not entered into a written agreement regarding the Property other than the documents required to transfer the Property from CC to the Appellant.\n[17] Regarding the agreement to care for CC, the Appellant testified that CC, who was close to 80 years old when they married, had several serious ailments and that caring for CC was a 24\/7 undertaking.\n[18] In cross-examination, the Appellant conceded that she had continued to work during her marriage to CC\u2014noting that she had flexible work hours\u2014and that she had no education or training relevant to the personal care of an individual. The Appellant had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: Okay. So what I understand from you, and you can just answer yes or no, is that it was only after the fact when you looked back on all of what you had done that you realized how much time and energy you had put into the caregiving services that you provided. Is that accurate?\nMS. CSAK: Yes, because you don\u2019t know what the future can bring, yeah.[6]\n[19] Counsel for the Respondent took the Appellant through a copy of an Affidavit of Residence and Value of Consideration (the \u201cAffidavit\u201d) and a Transfer\/Deed of Land (the \u201cDeed\u201d) respecting the Property, both of which are included in tab 3 of the Joint Book.\n[20] The Appellant conceded that she had signed the Affidavit, that it stated in section 4 that the total consideration for the Property was nil and that it stated in section 7 that:\nThis is a transfer for natural love and affection from husband to wife and there is no consideration therefore no land transfer tax is exigible.\n[21] The Appellant identified the signatures in sections 8 and 9 of the Deed as those of CC and herself, respectively.\n[22] With respect to paragraph 11(m) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant testified in chief that she had received nothing from the estate of CC. In cross\u2011examination, the Appellant acknowledged that she was the executrix and a beneficiary of CC\u2019s estate but reiterated that she had received nothing from CC\u2019s estate.\n[23] The Appellant also acknowledged that she had a duty to act in the best interests of the estate, stating that she had tried to do that by, among other things, paying $382,000 to the CRA.\n[24] With respect to paragraph 11(k) of the Amended Reply, the Appellant had the following exchange with her counsel:\nMR. BUOTE: \u2026 Do you agree that you pursued and directed the appeal to the Tax Court of Canada following Charlie\u2019s death?\nMS. CSAK: Absolutely not. I only signed the cheque and I didn\u2019t understand the case and I left everything for lawyers.[7]\n[25] In cross-examination, the Appellant had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: And you were aware of the tax appeal before Charlie passed away.\nMS. CSAK: Not -- not really.\nMS. MAHADEO: No.\nMS. CSAK: Not really. I only knew something was -- something is going on, but then only said don\u2019t worry, everything -- we only ask it was why we are even need a lawyer, the first one. And that one only said don\u2019t worry, everything was prepared by law and only once did -- after the meeting we ask this -- this lawyer why we are here. There was something wrong prepare it? And the lawyer said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be straightening up\u201d. That\u2019s it.\nAnd that only said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything was prepared by law\u201d.\nThis what we knew it. There was -- it was last year before he was alive. This what we already knew it. But we even didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.[8]\n[26] When counsel asked about the meeting mentioned in this exchange, the Appellant stated:\nThere was a few people because I know that was some parts of this, you know. There was a list of the names of the part of this, you know. And he was one of the name.\nCharlie or me, we didn\u2019t know this -- these people. We didn\u2019t know who is who. Only we knew the name and there was like (inaudible) defence lawyer and there was very briefly. And after the meeting, we only ask why we are here, why we need a lawyer.[9]\n[27] The Appellant testified that after CC passed away, she would deliver cheques to an accountant who was an appellant in the same group appeal. The accountant told her that the lawyer could not meet with all the members of the group, and the Appellant testified that she did not meet with the lawyer or receive updates from the lawyer at any time.\n[28] Counsel for the Appellant acknowledged that the Appellant had been subject to written examination for discovery in CC\u2019s appeal and that CC had not raised the statute-barred issue in his appeal. The Appellant then had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: You also did not raise the validity of the underlying assessments in Charlie\u2019s tax appeal; correct?\nMS. CSAK: I was not involved anything. I just make the cheque. I don\u2019t understand the whole ---[10]\n[29] With respect to the waivers for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years (collectively, the \u201cWaivers\u201d and, individually, the \u201c1988 Waiver\u201d and the \u201c1989 Waiver\u201d), the Appellant testified that she was 80% certain that the signature on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s signature and that she was 80% certain that the signature on the 1989 Waiver was CC\u2019s signature. The Appellant stated that she had witnessed CC signing cheques quite often over the years.\n[30] The Appellant made two comments regarding the handwritten address on the 1988 Waiver. First, CC came to Canada from Hungary when he was in his fifties and he did not have a sufficient command of the English language to handwrite his address. Second, the person who made the handwritten correction crossed out CC\u2019s correct address and added the wrong address. In contrast, CC\u2019s address on the 1989 Waiver is typed and is correct.\n[31] The copies of the Waivers submitted by the Appellant[11] each had a stamp stating \u201cDISCLOSED PURSUANT TO THE PA\u201d.\n[32] The Appellant did not know who prepared the Waivers. The copy of the 1988 Waiver submitted by the Appellant was not stamped by Revenue Canada.[12] The copy of the 1989 Waiver submitted by the Appellant has a stamp in the area reserved for departmental use stating that it was delivered by hand and was received by the Revenue Canada mailroom on May 31, 1993.[13]\n[33] The Respondent submitted a copy of the 1988 Waiver together with a copy of a letter from Barry Witkin, C.A., C.B.V., of BDO Dunwoody Ward Mallette addressed to Mr. Derek Potopsingh at the Mississauga District Office of Revenue Canada.[14] The copy of the 1988 Waiver included with exhibit R-1 is identical to the copy included in exhibit A-1 except that it does not have the Privacy Act stamp. The Respondent did not submit a copy of the 1989 Waiver without the Privacy Act stamp but instead relied on exhibit A-2.\n[34] The letter included in exhibit R-1 is dated September 11, 1992 and has a stamp stating that it was received by Revenue Canada Taxation in Mississauga on September 14, 1992. The letter does not have any indication of an enclosure with the letter (i.e., there is no \u201cEncl.\u201d or \u201cEnc.\u201d under the signature line; only the initials \u201c:ag\u201d). The letter states:\nRe: Charles Csak & Howard Deverett\nAt the request of John Campbell of Miller Thomson, I have arranged for the waivers for the above named clients to be signed so that the discussion with Mr. Campbell and yourself regarding the matter of Claridge Holdings # 1 can continue. I trust this is what you require.\nIf you have any questions concerning the above, please contact the writer.\nPlease note the change of address of each client.\n[35] Mr. Hassan testified that he found the letter and the 1988 Waiver in CC\u2019s physical file when, as a collections officer, he was assigned the file in 2019. In cross-examination, Mr. Hassan acknowledged that there was no indication on exhibit R-1 that the letter and the waiver had been stapled together.\n[36] Counsel for the Respondent took Mr. Hassan to exhibit A-2, which is a copy of the 1989 Waiver with a Privacy Act stamp. Mr. Hassan then had the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent:\nMS. MAHADEO: Have you seen this document before?\nMR. HASSAN: I believe I did.\nMS. MAHADEO: And where do you believe you saw this document?\nMR. HASSAN: It would also have been in the physical document.\n\u2026\nMS. MAHADEO: And you said you believe you saw this in the file. So the -- was the waiver in the file when you assumed carriage of it?\nMR. HASSAN: This waiver?\nMS. MAHADEO: Yes.\nMR. HASSAN: I believe so.[15]\n[37] With respect to the Revenue Canada \u201creceived\u201d stamp on the letter, Mr. Hussey testified that it was CRA mailroom policy to stamp only the first page of a multi-page document. In cross-examination, Mr. Hussey was asked why, given the importance of the date of a waiver, the CRA would not stamp a waiver when it is accompanied by a letter. Mr. Hussey responded:\nMR. HUSSEY: I didn\u2019t write the policy, but my speculation would be that the people who work for me in the mail room are not tax auditors. They wouldn\u2019t know if the first page was more important than the last page, so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why our policy says to stamp the first page.\nAnd again, we could have a -- we could have a document this thick.\nWe receive 1,000 pieces of mail a day. We don\u2019t have time to go through it. So stamp the first one, move on to the next one.\nAgain, primarily I think it\u2019s because the guys wouldn\u2019t know if -- what that waiver is.[16]\n[38] With respect to the 1989 Waiver, in cross-examination, Mr. Hussey testified that if the 1989 Waiver had been mailed to Revenue Canada through Canada Post, then it \u201cshould not\u201d have ended up with a delivered-by-hand stamp.[17] Mr. Hussey also confirmed that the CRA\u2019s mailroom practices were consistent across Canada.\nE. Judicial Notice of Facts That Are a Matter of Public Record [39] The judgment and reasons for judgment of Bowman C.J. in CC\u2019s appeal were issued on July 12, 2006 under the citation Makuz v. R.[18] The style of cause names 16 appellants including CC, but does not name the estate of CC. The Court file numbers indicate that the appeals of the 16 appellants (collectively, the \u201cGroup\u201d) were filed in 1996 and 1997. The Court file number for CC\u2019s appeal indicates that it was filed in 1996, which the Minister assumes as a fact.\n[40] In paragraph 4 of his reasons, Bowman C.J. describes the issue in the appeals by the Group (the \u201cGroup Appeals\u201d) as follows:\nThe issue in all of the appeals is the same for all of the appellants. It is whether a loss in a partnership, in which the appellants claimed to have an interest, is deductible by the appellants in computing their income in the years 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991. \u2026\n[41] In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his reasons, Bowman C.J. states:\nThe facts are complicated and they include a multiplicity of transactions. A number of corporations and three partnerships are involved. \u2026\n\u2026\nIn a nutshell, here is the problem. Partnership A had a fiscal period ending December 31, 1987. Partnership B had a fiscal period ending March 31, 1988. Partnership B acquired a partnership interest in Partnership A on December 31, 1987. Partnership A sustained a loss before the end of its fiscal period that ended on December 31, 1987. Therefore, Partnership B\u2019s share of that loss should enter into the computation of its income or loss for the period ending March 31, 1988. The appellants\u2019 position is that they acquired partnership interests in Partnership B before March 31, 1988. Therefore they claimed their proportionate share of the loss of Partnership B.\n[42] I recognize that Bowman C.J.\u2019s statements are hearsay if entered for their truth. However, I am referring to them solely as an indication of Bowman C.J.\u2019s impressions regarding the Group Appeals.\n[43] Bowman C.J.\u2019s reasons comprise 76 paragraphs, and attached to the reasons as schedules A and B are a 33-paragraph agreement of certain facts and 15 slides describing the relevant transactions.\nIII. The Submissions of the Parties A. The Appellant [44] The Appellant submits that she has a right to challenge the reassessments of CC\u2019s 1988 through 1991 taxation years on which the Appellant\u2019s liability under section 160 is based: Joanne M. Gaucher v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2000 D.T.C. 6678 (FCA) (\u201cGaucher\u201d) at paragraphs 7 and 9.\n[45] The Respondent has conceded that the Disputed CC Reassessments were issued by the Minister after the expiration of the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years. The issue is whether, for each of those taxation years, the condition in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) was satisfied prior to the expiry of the normal reassessment period for the year.\n[46] The 1988 Waiver did not have a date stamp, and there is no evidence to establish that the letter included in exhibit R-1 was ever attached to the 1988 Waiver or included in an envelope with the 1988 Waiver.\n[47] The evidence of the Appellant is that the signature on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s signature, that the handwriting on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s handwriting and that the address for CC that was handwritten on the 1988 Waiver was not CC\u2019s address. The Appellant opined that CC would not sign the 1988 Waiver with the wrong address.[19]\n[48] The Minister initially assessed CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year on May 30, 1990. The stamp on the 1989 Waiver states that it was delivered by hand to Revenue Canada on May 31, 1993. This date is after the three-year normal reassessment period fixed by paragraph 152(3.1)(b) for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year.\n[49] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act[20] extends the time for \u201cthe doing of a thing\u201d. There is no time limit for filing a waiver and therefore no requirement to extend the time for filing a waiver. Consequently, section 26 of the Interpretation Act has no application to the filing of the 1989 Waiver.\n[50] In this case, the only \u201cthing\u201d that required extension is the period in which the Minister could reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year. However, the Minister did not reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year until April 21, 1994, so an extension of the deadline to reassess to May 31, 1993 was of no consequence.\n[51] With respect to consideration, the issue is not whether there was an enforceable contract between CC and the Appellant. The issue is whether consideration was given by the Appellant to CC for the Property. The evidence is that there was a quid pro quo\u2014CC transferred the Property to the Appellant in exchange for the Appellant agreeing to marry CC and to care for CC.\n[52] Finally, the parties agree that on September 19, 2003, the Appellant, as executrix of CC\u2019s estate, paid $382,377 on account of CC\u2019s tax liability for his 1988 taxation year.[21] The Appellant submits that there is no evidence that this payment reduced the balance owing for CC\u2019s 1988 taxation year. The Appellant asks the Court to direct that the payment be applied to reduce CC\u2019s balance owing for his 1988 taxation year.\nB. The Respondent [53] The Respondent submits that the Appellant did not provide any consideration to CC in exchange for the transfer of the Property to her. The Appellant confirmed that she did not provide to CC, at the time of the transfer of the Property, money paid or to be paid, mortgages assumed or given back to CC, property transferred in exchange for the Property, or other valuable consideration subject to land transfer tax.\n[54] The Appellant\u2019s evidence was that she did not enter into a written agreement with CC regarding care services. The Appellant had no training as a nurse or professional support worker. The Appellant did not agree to care for CC for a specified amount of time and did not identify the value of the services that she provided. The Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding care services was given based on hindsight rather than an agreement at the time of the transfer. The Appellant acknowledged that caring for CC was much more onerous than she had anticipated.\n[55] The case law does not support the conclusion that domestic services constitute consideration for the purposes of subsection 160(1): Macleod v. R., 2012 TCC 379 at paragraphs 33 to 37 and Raphael v. R., [2000] 4 C.T.C. 2620.\n[56] The case law holds that the onus falls on the Appellant to prove that the transfer of the Property was made pursuant to a genuine contractual arrangement: Konyi v. R., 2017 TCC 175 (\u201cKonyi\u201d) at paragraph 19. This requires the Appellant to establish all the essential terms of a contract, including specificity as to the consideration to be paid and the terms of payment: Konyi at paragraph 20 and Madsen v. R., 2005 TCC 110 at paragraph 28. The relevant time for determining the consideration is at the time that the Property is transferred: Hardtke v. R., 2015 TCC 135 at paragraph 33, affirmed 2016 FCA 138.\n[57] The principle in Gaucher does not apply to the Appellant. Gaucher contemplates a circumstance in which the taxpayer has no ability or right to challenge the validity of the underlying assessment. The Appellant was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate and therefore was a party to the litigation respecting the underlying reassessments and had the right to challenge the underlying reassessments.\n[58] The Appellant is precluded from challenging the Disputed CC Reassessments by the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process. The doctrine of res judicata has two commonly recognized branches: cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel.\n[59] In this case, the correctness of the Disputed CC Reassessments are has been decided. The parties to this appeal and to CC\u2019s appeal are the same or are in privity with one another. That is, either the Appellant was a party to CC\u2019s appeal by virtue of being the executrix of CC\u2019s estate, or the Appellant was in privity with CC\u2019s estate by virtue of that role. With respect to privity, counsel for the Respondent cites Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner & Keeler Ltd. (No. 2), [1967] 1 A.C. 853, Ethel Annabelle Angle v. Minister of National Revenue, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248, Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44 at paragraph 60 and Stallan v. Palleson, 2015 BCSC 1463 (\u201cStallan\u201d) at paragraph 30.\n[60] In the alternative, the doctrine of abuse of process applies to preclude the Appellant\u2019s challenge of the Disputed CC Reassessments. Given the Appellant\u2019s level of participation in the litigation of CC\u2019s appeal, including being the person legally controlling the proceedings on behalf of CC\u2019s estate, participating in discoveries as the estate\u2019s nominee in examination for discoveries, making litigation decisions, and receiving updates from the lead appellant, the principles of finality, consistency, and administration of justice support a conclusion that it is an abuse of process for the Appellant to challenge the Disputed CC Reassessments on the basis that they are statute-barred, when she failed to do so in the course of CC\u2019s appeal.\n[61] In the further alternative, the Disputed CC Reassessments are valid because CC filed waivers in respect of the normal reassessment periods for his 1988 and 1989 taxation years.\n[62] The Appellant did not allege in her notice of appeal or at discovery that she disputed the authenticity of the signature in the 1988 Waiver; therefore, she is precluded from doing so at the hearing of this appeal. The Appellant failed to call the author of the letter in the CRA\u2019s physical file, and the evidence of the Appellant alone is not sufficient to find that CC did not sign the 1988 Waiver.\n[63] The evidence establishes that the 1988 Waiver was filed on September 14, 1992 and that the 1989 Waiver was filed on May 31, 1993. Because May 30, 1993 was a Sunday, the deadline for filing the 1989 Waiver was extended to May 31, 1993 by section 26 of the Interpretation Act.\n[64] Under paragraph 160(1)(e), the Assessment properly included interest accrued on the liability of CC under the ITA to August 14, 2012: 1455257 Ontario Inc. v. R., 2021 FCA 142 at paragraphs 44 to 50.\n[65] There is no dispute that a payment on account of CC\u2019s tax liability of $382,377 was made on or about September 19, 2003. Pursuant to section 224.1, this payment was applied by the Minister to reduce CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 taxation year.\n[66] However, subsection 160(3) does not apply to reduce the Appellant\u2019s liability for two reasons. First, the Appellant was not liable under section 160 at the time of the payment because she had not been assessed under section 160 at that time. Second, the payment was not on account of the Appellant\u2019s liability under section 160.\nIV. Analysis A. Overview of Subsection 160(1) [67] The version of subsection 160(1) in force at the time of the Assessment stated:\n(1) Tax liability re property transferred not at arm\u2019s length \u2014 Where a person has, on or after May 1, 1951, transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to\n(a) the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner,\n(b) a person who was under 18 years of age, or\n(c) a person with whom the person was not dealing at arm\u2019s length,\nthe following rules apply:\n(d) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay a part of the transferor\u2019s tax under this Part for each taxation year equal to the amount by which the tax for the year is greater than it would have been if it were not for the operation of sections 74 to 75.1 of this Act and section 74 of the Income Tax Act, chapter 148 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, in respect of any income from, or gain from the disposition of, the property so transferred or property substituted therefor, and\n(e) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the property at the time it was transferred exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property, and\n(ii) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this Act (including, for greater certainty, an amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this section, regardless of whether the Minister has made an assessment under subsection (2) for that amount) in or in respect of the taxation year in which the property was transferred or any preceding taxation year,\nbut nothing in this subsection limits the liability of the transferor under any other provision of this Act or of the transferee for the interest that the transferee is liable to pay under this Act on an assessment in respect of the amount that the transferee is liable to pay because of this subsection.[22]\n[68] In Eyeball Networks Inc. v. R.,[23] No\u00ebl C.J. summarizes the application and the purpose of subsection 160(1) as follows:\nSubsection 160(1) provides that when a person transfers property to a non\u2011arm\u2019s length person, the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally liable to pay any amount that the transferor was liable to pay under the Act for the taxation year in which the transfer occurred and any preceding years. Under paragraph 160(1)(e), the transferee\u2019s liability is limited to the excess of the fair market value of the property transferred over the fair market value of the consideration given for the property. ...\n...\nAs affirmed by this Court, the purpose of subsection 160(1) is to protect the tax authorities against any vulnerability that may result from a transfer of property between non-arm\u2019s length persons for a consideration that is less than the fair market value of the transferred property. ...[24]\n[69] I would add to this that it is also important to consider the comments of Rothstein J. in Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 26 at paragraph 75:\nThe Minister has numerous basis for challenging the deductions taken by a taxpayer. He may rely on sham or the general anti-avoidance rule to name just two. He did not do so in this case. In reassessment cases, the role of the court is solely to adjudicate disputes between the Minister and the taxpayer. It is not a protector of government revenue. The court must decide only whether the Minister, on the basis on which he chooses to assess, is right or wrong.\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[70] Accordingly, whether or not the Minister is otherwise able to collect the tax that the Minister says is owed by CC is not the issue. The issue is whether the assessment against the Appellant under subsection 160(1) is right or wrong.\n[71] Subsection 160(1) can be divided into two parts. The first part, which comprises the text before the mid-amble (i.e., before the words \u201cthe following rules apply\u201d), identifies the conditions that must be satisfied for the subsection to apply. The second part, which comprises the text after the mid-amble, describes the rules that apply when the conditions in the first part are satisfied.\n[72] On January 8, 1993, CC transferred the Property to the Appellant (the \u201cTransfer\u201d), who at the time of the Transfer was the spouse of CC. The Appellant accepts that the conditions stated in the first part of subsection 160(1) have been met.\n[73] The Appellant raises two defences relevant to the application of the second part of subsection 160(1) to the Appellant.\n[74] The first defence is that the Appellant paid consideration for the transfer of the Property in the form of an agreement to marry CC and an agreement to care for CC. The Appellant says that these agreements were a quid pro quo for the transfer of the Property.\n[75] The second defence is that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute-barred, and that CC had no liability under those reassessments for the purposes of determining the amount specified in subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii) in respect of CC.\nB. The Consideration Given by the Appellant for the Property [76] The value of consideration for a transfer of property is determined at the time of the transfer. At paragraph 52 of Eyeball Networks, No\u00ebl C.J. states:\n... a transfer of property takes place instantaneously both at civil and common law. The precise and clearly identifiable time when a transfer takes place under both legal systems is the notion that Parliament seized on in providing both that the value of the property is determined \u201cat the time it was transferred\u201d and the value of the consideration given is determined \u201cat that time\u201d. \u2026\n[Emphasis added.]\n[77] The Appellant acknowledges that she did not have an agreement in writing with CC that addressed consideration for the transfer of the Property. In Ontario, subsection 1(1) of the Statute of Frauds[25] states:\n1 (1) Every estate or interest of freehold and every uncertain interest of, in, to or out of any messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments shall be made or created by a writing signed by the parties making or creating the same, or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized in writing, and, if not so made or created, has the force and effect of an estate at will only, and shall not be deemed or taken to have any other or greater force or effect.\n[78] The only pieces of evidence in writing relating to the transfer of the Property from CC to the Appellant are the Deed and the Affidavit, copies of which are at tab 3 of the Joint Book.\n[79] The Deed does not address the consideration for the transfer of the Property.\n[80] The Appellant testified that she signed the Affidavit. The Affidavit states that the Appellant paid nil consideration for the Property, and that the Transfer was for natural love and affection from husband to wife. The Appellant did not dispute the accuracy of the information stated in the Affidavit.\n[81] On the basis of the documentary evidence and the testimony of the Appellant in cross-examination regarding the Affidavit, I find that the Appellant gave no consideration for the Property. However, to be complete, I will address the specific consideration identified by the Appellant.\n[82] With respect to the agreement to marry, the Transfer occurred after the Appellant and CC were married. There is no evidence of a legally binding agreement between CC and the Appellant identifying marriage as consideration given by the Appellant for the Property, and there is no evidence of the fair market value of such a promise. A promise to marry that had already been fulfilled by the Appellant at the time of the Transfer cannot be consideration given by the Appellant for the Property at the time of the Transfer.\n[83] With respect to the agreement to care for CC, the Appellant\u2019s testimony indicates that it was only with hindsight that the Appellant ascertained the level of work involved in caring for CC. The Appellant continued to work outside the home after marrying CC and had no special training qualifying her to care for CC in a manner beyond the level of care that might be expected of any spouse. Further, there is no evidence of a legally binding agreement identifying future care of CC as consideration for the Property, and there is no evidence regarding the value of such future care.\n[84] I therefore conclude that the two promises identified by the Appellant were not consideration given by the Appellant for the Property at the time of the Transfer.\nC. The Disputed CC Reassessments (1) The Application of the Gaucher Principle [85] In Gaucher, the Minister assessed the appellant under section 160. Rothstein J.A. (as he then was) described the background as follows:\nThe appellant\u2019s former husband was assessed for approximately $350,000 of tax. The assessment was confirmed by the Tax Court of Canada. Shortly before the Tax Court confirmed the assessment, the appellant\u2019s former husband transferred a residence to her. A few months later, the former husband declared bankruptcy.[26]\n[86] The spouse challenged the assessment of her former husband on the ground that it was issued after the expiry of the normal reassessment period. The Tax Court judge denied the appellant\u2019s appeal. Rothstein J.A. overturned that decision, stating:\nI am of the respectful view that the Tax Court Judge was in error in coming to this conclusion. It is a basic rule of natural justice that, barring a statutory provision to the contrary, a person who is not a party to litigation cannot be bound by a judgment between other parties. The appellant was not a party to the reassessment proceedings between the Minister and her former husband. Those proceedings did not purport to impose any liability on her. While she may have been a witness in those proceedings, she was not a party, and hence could not in those proceedings raise defences to her former husband\u2019s assessment.\nWhen the Minister issues a derivative assessment under subsection 160(1), a special statutory provision is invoked entitling the Minister to seek payment from a second person for the tax assessed against the primary tax payer. That second person must have a full right of defence to challenge the assessment made against her, including an attack on the primary assessment on which the second person\u2019s assessment is based.[27]\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[87] More recently, in Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd., 2018 FCA 166 (\u201c594710\u201d), the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed the principle stated in Gaucher as follows:\nHoldco appealed the section 160 assessment to the Tax Court on several grounds, one of which was to deny that Partnerco had a tax liability. In an appeal of a section 160 assessment, Holdco is entitled to challenge the assessment issued to Partnerco on any grounds that would have been open to Partnerco if it had appealed directly (Gaucher v. R., 2000 D.T.C. 6678, [2001] 1 C.T.C. 125 (Fed. C.A.)).[28]\n[Emphasis added.]\n[88] The Respondent submits that the approach taken in Gaucher rests on the fact that the Appellant in that case was not a party to the underlying proceedings. The Respondent submits that the Appellant here was a party to CC\u2019s appeal in her capacity of executrix of CC\u2019s estate.\n[89] I do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Appellant\u2019s role in CC\u2019s appeal. The Appellant was not a party to CC\u2019s appeal and the estate of CC is not listed in the style of cause of Bowman C.J.\u2019s judgment and reasons.\n[90] Even if the estate of CC was a de facto party to CC\u2019s appeal by virtue of CC\u2019s death, the Appellant\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis CC\u2019s appeal was in her capacity as the personal representative of CC\u2019s estate.[29] To the extent that the Appellant had an interest in CC\u2019s appeal, it was in that representative capacity. Adopting Rothstein J.A.\u2019s observation in paragraph 6 of Gaucher, CC\u2019s appeal did not purport to impose liability on the Appellant even after she became the executrix of CC\u2019s estate.\n[91] As executrix of CC\u2019s estate, the Appellant owed a duty to the creditors and beneficiaries of CC\u2019s estate. Waters summarizes the task of the personal representative of a deceased individual:\nThe task of the personal representative of the deceased is to gather in the assets of the deceased, to discharge funeral and testamentary expenses and debts, and to distribute the remaining assets among the persons entitled.[30]\n[92] The Appellant testified that she did her best to fulfil her duty as executrix. I have no reason to question that statement.\n[93] CC\u2019s appeal was one of 16 appeals by the Group that were heard by Bowman C.J. at the same time on common evidence. The Group was represented by a lawyer, although it appears that the original lawyer was replaced prior to the hearing of the Group Appeals.[31]\n[94] Bowman C.J. stated in paragraph 6 of his reasons in Makuz that the \u201cfacts are complicated and they include a multiplicity of transactions.\u201d Bowman C.J. clearly did not view the subject matter of the Group Appeals as simple and straightforward.\n[95] The Appellant testified that she and CC attended one meeting at which the lawyer for the Group was present but they did not understand the nature of CC\u2019s appeal or the need for a lawyer. On the basis of the Appellant\u2019s testimony as a whole and Bowman C.J.\u2019s description of the subject matter of the Group Appeals, I find this to be quite plausible, if not highly likely.\n[96] The Appellant testified that, following CC\u2019s death, she gave cheques to another appellant in the Group, but she did not understand the nature of the appeal. I can identify no reason why the Appellant\u2019s understanding of CC\u2019s appeal would improve because she was named executrix of CC\u2019s estate. The Group was still represented by a lawyer, who it is reasonable to assume was directing the strategy employed in the Group Appeals.\n[97] The fact that the Appellant was subject to written discovery in CC\u2019s appeal is of no consequence. Presumably, this occurred because CC had passed away. There is no reason to believe that the Appellant had any material knowledge of the facts of CC\u2019s appeal given that CC\u2019s participation in the tax shelter commenced prior to March 31, 1988 and the Appellant and CC were not married until October 1992. In any event, being subject to discovery as the personal representative of CC\u2019s estate does not make the Appellant a party to CC\u2019s appeal.\n[98] Waivers were filed with Revenue Canada for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years. The letter submitted by the Respondent with the 1988 Waiver[32] states that signatures on the waiver for CC and one other individual were obtained at the request of a lawyer named in the letter so that discussions could continue regarding the subject matter of the Group Appeals. Consequently, the Group\u2019s lawyer must have been aware of the statute-barred issue for CC\u2019s 1988 taxation year.\n[99] Although there is no similar evidence in respect of the 1989 Waiver, the Appellant\u2019s evidence regarding CC\u2019s and the Appellant\u2019s minimal involvement in the Group Appeals suggests that any actions regarding a waiver for 1989 were instigated by the lawyer for the Group and that it is unlikely that either CC or the Appellant understood the nature of the issue.\n[100] The case law indicates that any statute-barred issue had to be raised in CC\u2019s notice of appeal; otherwise, the Respondent was not required to prove the existence of a valid waiver.[33] According to the court file numbers of the Group Appeals, the notices of appeal for the members of the Group were filed in 1996 and 1997. The Minister assumes as a fact that CC\u2019s appeal was filed in 1996, which was approximately six years prior to his death on March 9, 2002.[34]\n[101] The Respondent\u2019s proposition that the Appellant became responsible for raising a statute-barred issue following CC\u2019s death solely because she was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate is simply not tenable. Indeed, it is entirely unclear to me how the Appellant could be expected to identify the statute-barred issue for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years given that the issue arose from the expiry of the normal reassessment periods for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years in 1992 and 1993 and given that CC\u2019s appeal was filed some six years prior to his death.\n(2) Res Judicata and Abuse of Process [102] The Respondent further submits that the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process preclude the Appellant from raising the argument that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute\u2011barred. With respect to res judicata, the Respondent relies on issue estoppel, which is an aspect of the doctrine of res judicata. The abuse of process and res judicata doctrines share the same concerns and underlying principles. However, the abuse of process doctrine is more flexible.[35]\n[103] Rothstein J.A.\u2019s statement in Gaucher, which indicates that the Appellant\u2019s right to challenge the Disputed CC Reassessments is \u201ca basic rule of natural justice\u201d, suggests that this line of attack by the Respondent is misguided. Nevertheless, I will address the Respondent\u2019s position.\n[104] The Respondent submits that the three requirements for a finding of issue estoppel and abuse of process have been satisfied.\n[105] The first requirement identified by the Respondent is that the issue must be the same as the one decided in the prior decision. In CIBC, Hogan J. observes:\nTypically, when a party pleads issue estoppel, the first requirement is the most difficult to satisfy. To satisfy the first requirement, it is not sufficient that the question was incidental in the previous proceeding. As Angle instructs us, \u201c[t]he question out of which the estoppel is said to arise must have been \u201cfundamental to the decision arrived at in the earlier proceedings.\u201d[36]\n[Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added in the original.]\n[106] The issue raised by the Appellant in this appeal is that the Disputed CC Reassessments were statute-barred and that therefore, the amounts of the Disputed CC Reassessments do not contribute to the amount determined under subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii). The issue decided in Makuz was that the reassessments appealed by the Group were correct. These issues are not the same.\n[107] Whether a reassessment is statute-barred and whether a reassessment is correct are two separate issues. The former issue must be decided in favour of the Minister before the latter issue comes into play. This is because a reassessment that is statute-barred is null and void[37] and therefore the determination of whether such a reassessment is correct does not arise.\n[108] The difference between the two issues is highlighted by the two distinct burdens of proof. A statute-barred issue in respect of which the Minister asserts that a reassessment is not null and void places a burden of proof on the Minister[38] while a correctness issue places a burden of proof on the taxpayer. The Minister must meet her burden of proof; otherwise, there is no reassessment giving rise to the correctness issue.\n[109] In this appeal, the Minister\u2019s burden of proof focuses on whether the Minister could issue valid reassessments for CC\u2019s 1988 and 1989 taxation years after the expiration of the normal reassessment periods for those years on the basis that CC had filed valid waivers for those years. I will return to the validity of the Waivers below.\n[110] The third requirement identified by the Respondent is that the parties to both proceedings must be the same or their privies. In Stallan, the Supreme Court of British Columbia stated the following, at paragraph 30 of that decision:\nFor the purposes of the doctrine of res judicata, another person is a \u201cprivy\u201d of a party to the lawsuit when there is a sufficient degree of common interest and identification between them which makes it just that the outcome should be binding over both parties. \u2026\n[111] For the reasons already stated, the parties in this appeal are not the same as the parties in CC\u2019s appeal. Moreover, the Appellant was not a privy of CC in respect of CC\u2019s income tax appeal because the Appellant had no personal interest in the subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal even though she was the executrix of CC\u2019s estate and a beneficiary of CC\u2019s estate.[39]\n[112] An income tax appeal relates to a particular taxpayer and to the liability of that taxpayer under the ITA for one or more taxation years. The subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal cannot be equated with the subject matter of, for example, a lawsuit by CC regarding the ownership of a property. It is only in the case of a lawsuit over property that the Appellant, as heir of CC, might be said to have an interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit.\n[113] The fact that a favourable result in CC\u2019s income tax appeal would have left more assets available to the Appellant in her capacity as heir of CC is an indirect consequence of the outcome of CC\u2019s income tax appeal. This indirect consequence does not establish that the Appellant had a sufficient degree of common interest in the subject matter of CC\u2019s income tax appeal to constitute her a privy of CC in respect of that appeal.\n[114] I conclude, therefore, that the first and third requirements identified by the Respondent have not been satisfied.\n[115] This finding is not unfair to the Respondent. The Respondent has been fully notified of the statute\u2011barred issue in this appeal and has presented evidence to address that issue. The Minister is not prejudiced by the assertion by the Appellant that the Disputed CC Reassessments are statute\u2011barred, but the Appellant would be prejudiced if she could not raise that issue in this appeal.\n[116] I recognize that the effluxion of time may have impacted the ability of the Minister to meet her burden of proof regarding the Waivers. However, this results from the fact that the Minister assessed the Appellant under section 160 nearly 20 years after the Transfer and the expiration of the applicable normal reassessment periods, and not from any action or inaction by the Appellant.\n[117] On the basis of the foregoing, the principles of res judicata and abuse of process do not apply to preclude the Appellant from raising the statute\u2011barred issue in respect of the Disputed CC Reassessments.\n(3) The Validity of the Waivers (a) The 1988 Waiver [118] The Appellant submits that the 1988 Waiver was not signed by CC. The Respondent takes exception to the Appellant\u2019s evidence that the signature on the 1988 Waiver may not be that of CC.\n[119] The signature on the 1988 Waiver no doubt has a certain firmness that is not present in the signatures on the Deed and the 1989 Waiver. However, I am unable to conclude that the signature on the 1988 Waiver is not that of CC. The letters in all three signatures and the appearance and flow of those letters are sufficiently similar to preclude such a finding. Consequently, even if I permitted the Appellant\u2019s evidence on the signature, I would find that CC signed the 1988 Waiver.\n[120] I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that CC could not write in the English language and recognize that it is odd indeed that the 1988 Waiver has a handwritten address for CC that is wrong. However, this anomaly does not in and of itself invalidate the 1988 Waiver.\n[121] This leaves the question of when the 1988 Waiver was filed with the Minister. The text of the letter included in exhibit R-1 does not address the filing of the 1988 Waiver. The main paragraph of the letter states:\nAt the request of John Campbell of Miller Thomson, I have arranged for the waivers for the above named clients to be signed so that the discussion with Mr. Campbell and yourself regarding the matter of Claridge Holdings # 1 can continue. I trust this is what you require.\n[Emphasis and double emphasis added.]\n[122] The text of the letter states only that the author has arranged for waivers to be signed but does not say anything about waivers being enclosed with the letter. As a result, the statement \u201cI trust this is what you require\u201d is at best ambiguous regarding whether the 1988 Waiver accompanied the letter.\n[123] Mr. Hassan testified that in 2019, he found the letter and the 1988 Waiver in CC\u2019s physical file. Mr. Hassan acknowledged that there was no indication that the letter and the 1988 Waiver had been stapled together. Also, the letter itself shows no indication of an enclosure (i.e., there is no \u201cEncl.\u201d or \u201cEnc.\u201d under the signature line, only the initials \u201c:ag\u201d).\n[124] Mr. Hussey testified that the practice of the CRA mailroom is to stamp the first page of a multi-page document. However, in the absence of evidence that the 1988 Waiver was attached to or enclosed with the letter, there is no factual basis on which to conclude that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were a multi-page document.\n[125] Mr. Hassan\u2019s testimony that in 2019, the letter and the 1988 Waiver were in the same physical file is not evidence that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were a single multi-page document, nor is it evidence that the letter and the 1988 Waiver were received at the same time. Documents in a physical file may be placed in that file at any time.\n[126] The inference that counsel for the Respondent is asking me to draw from Mr. Hassan\u2019s and Mr. Hussey\u2019s evidence is circular. The inference is that because the letter and the 1988 Waiver were in the same physical file in 2019 and because only the letter was stamped, the 1988 Waiver must have been attached to or enclosed with the letter. This inference in turn would explain why only the letter was stamped by the mailroom personnel. I decline to draw this inference because there is insufficient evidence to support the inference and, therefore, the inference is mere speculation.\n[127] The absence of a \u201creceived\u201d stamp on the 1988 Waiver is particularly troubling given that the waiver form has a box labelled \u201cFor Departmental Use Only\u201d and that, on the basis of the 1989 Waiver, Revenue Canada mailroom employees were aware of this box and were aware that the \u201creceived\u201d stamp should be placed in that box.\n[128] Mr. Hussey speculated that the reason for the mailroom policy of stamping the first page of a multi-page document was that the mailroom employees are not auditors and are not qualified to identify a waiver. However, the 1988 Waiver form states in large bold caps:\nWAIVER IN RESPECT OF THE\nNORMAL REASSESSMENT PERIOD\n[129] A waiver impacts a very material right of a taxpayer to the benefit of the Minister.[40] The waiver form is clearly identified as a waiver of the normal reassessment period and includes a box for a \u201creceived\u201d stamp. If the Minister has chosen to rely on a mailroom policy that reduces the evidential value of a waiver form received by the Minister, the consequences of that decision fall on the Minister rather than the Appellant.\n[130] On the basis of the foregoing, I find that there is insufficient evidence to determine the date on which the 1988 Waiver was received by the Minister. Consequently, with respect to the 1988 Waiver, the Minister has failed to meet her burden of proof under subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) on a balance of probabilities.\n[131] Consequently, I find that the 1988 Transferor Reassessment was statute\u2011barred and that the amount of that reassessment is not included in the amount determined under paragraph 160(1)(e).\n(b) The 1989 Waiver [132] There is no dispute that the 1989 Waiver was received by the Minister on the date specified by the Revenue Canada mailroom stamp on that waiver. The Appellant submits that the Revenue Canada stamp on the 1989 Waiver indicates that that waiver was filed on May 31, 1993, which is the day after the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year expired.\n[133] Mr. Hussey testified that if the 1989 Waiver had been mailed to Revenue Canada, it \u201cshould not\u201d have had a stamp saying that it was hand-delivered.[41]\n[134] On the basis of the stamp on the 1989 Waiver and Mr. Hussey\u2019s testimony, I find that the 1989 Waiver was delivered by hand to Revenue Canada and was received by Revenue Canada on May 31, 1993, which is not within the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year.\n[135] The Respondent submits that the rule in section 26 of the Interpretation Act extended the deadline for filing the 1989 Waiver from May 30, 1993 to May 31, 1993. Consequently, the 1989 Waiver permits the Minister to reassess CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period for that year.\n[136] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) allows the Minister to reassess a taxation year beyond the normal reassessment period if the taxpayer has filed a waiver. Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) states:\n152 (4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n...\n(ii) has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year;\n[Emphasis added.]\n[137] The question raised by the Respondent\u2019s position is whether section 26 of the Interpretation Act has the effect of deeming the 1989 Waiver to have been filed within the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year when the waiver was actually filed after the expiration of that normal reassessment period.\n[138] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act states:\nWhere the time limited for the doing of a thing expires or falls on a holiday, the thing may be done on the day next following that is not a holiday.[42]\n[139] Section 26 of the Interpretation Act is one of several rules in that statute to be applied when interpreting an Act of Parliament (including the Interpretation Act).[43] Section 12 of the Interpretation Act states:\nEvery enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[140] In Lubana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1348, Prothonotary Lafreni\u00e8re described the purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act as follows, at paragraph 6 of that decision:\n\u2026 The purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act is to relieve a party from being in default under the Rules when unable to take a step or to do a thing on the last day of fixed period which falls on a holiday and to deem such step taken or such thing done on the next practicable date to be performed timeously. \u2026\n[141] Counsel for the Appellant submits that there is no time limit for the filing of a waiver and that therefore, section 26 of the Interpretation Act does not apply to the filing of the 1989 Waiver. Counsel notes that the limitation period fixed by the normal reassessment period relates to the doing of a thing by the Minister (i.e., making a reassessment), not to the doing of a thing by the taxpayer.\n[142] Neither counsel cited a case that addresses the application of section 26 of the Interpretation Act to the filing of a waiver and I have been unable to find such a case. Consequently, the impact of section 26 of the Interpretation Act on the application of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) raises a novel question of statutory interpretation.\n[143] In paragraph 25 of R. v. Breault, 2023 SCC 9, the Supreme Court of Canada summarizes the proper approach to statutory interpretation as follows:\nEvery statutory interpretation exercise involves reading the words of a provision \u201cin their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26; see also R. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 15, at para. 21).\n[144] In paragraphs 41 and 61 of Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51, the Supreme Court of Canada elaborates on this approach in the income tax context:\nThis narrow question of statutory interpretation requires us to draw upon the well-established framework that \u201cstatutory interpretation entails discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute\u2019s scheme and objects\u201d (Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, at para. 21). Where the rubber hits the road is in determining the relative weight to be afforded to the text, context and purpose. Where the words of a statute are \u201cprecise and unequivocal\u201d, their ordinary meaning will play a dominant role (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10). In the taxation context, a \u201cunified textual, contextual and purposive\u201d approach continues to apply (Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Finance), 2006 SCC 20, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 715, at para. 22, quoting Canada Trustco, at para. 47). In applying this unified approach, however, the particularity and detail of many tax provisions along with the Duke of Westminster principle (that taxpayers are entitled to arrange their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable) lead us to focus carefully on the text and context in assessing the broader purpose of the scheme (Placer Dome, at para. 21; Canada Trustco, at para. 11). ...\n...\nI again reiterate that if taxpayers are to act with any degree of certainty, then full effect should be given to Parliament\u2019s precise and unequivocal words. \u2026\n[145] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) extends the normal reassessment period for CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year \u201conly if [CC] has filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for [CC] in respect of\u201d CC\u2019s 1989 taxation year. The words \u201conly if\u201d emphasize that the words that follow stipulate a mandatory condition or requirement.\n[146] When one reads the words of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, the subparagraph identifies an event that must have occurred for a waiver to be effective: the taxpayer \u201chas filed with the Minister a waiver in prescribed form within the normal reassessment period for the taxpayer in respect of the year\u201d.\n[147] Subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) does not state a time limit for a taxpayer to file a waiver. Rather, subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) states that for the Minister to reassess a taxation year of a taxpayer after the normal reassessment period, the taxpayer must have filed a waiver prior to the expiry of that normal reassessment period. A taxpayer has three or four years[44] after an initial assessment or notification that no tax is payable to file a waiver that satisfies the condition in subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii).\n[148] In Mitchell, the Federal Court of Canada \u2013 Appeal Division observed:\n\u2026 A waiver is a privilege which a taxpayer has, and, if sent, Revenue Canada cannot ignore it.[45]\n[149] A taxpayer that chooses not to file a waiver does not lose a right, such as the right to object to or appeal from an assessment. Rather, the taxpayer chooses not to give the Minister a right under subparagraph 152(4)(2)(a)(ii) to reassess the taxpayer beyond the normal reassessment period.\n[150] The filing of a waiver might in theory benefit a taxpayer that wishes the Minister to reassess what would otherwise be a statute\u2011barred taxation year of the taxpayer.[46]\n[151] However, the filing of a waiver by a taxpayer does not compel the Minister to reassess the taxation year of the taxpayer to which the waiver applies. In Imperial Oil Limited and Inco Limited v. R., 2003 TCC 46,[47] Bowman A.C.J. (as he then was) stated at paragraph 38:\nCounsel for the respondent argues that there is no way a taxpayer can protect itself from errors in its own returns other than, perhaps, relying upon the Minister\u2019s leniency in accepting amended returns and assessing so as to permit the taxpayer to object if the Minister refuses to give effect to the amended return. There is no mechanism whereby the Minister can be compelled to accept an amended return or to act upon it if he chooses not to. I do not share counsel\u2019s faith in the Minister\u2019s magnanimity in voluntarily accommodating a taxpayer\u2019s requests to amend its returns. A taxpayer\u2019s legal right to compel reassessments lies in the objection and appeal process.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[152] Consequently, by filing a waiver, the taxpayer does not preserve a right of the taxpayer that would cease to exist but for the filing of the waiver. The taxpayer preserves indefinitely[48] the right of the Minister to reassess the taxation year of the taxpayer covered by the waiver.\n[153] The application of section 26 of the Interpretation Act to the filing of the 1989 Waiver would not relieve CC of a default under the ITA. Rather, the only effect would be to relieve the Minister of compliance with a statutory limitation period.\n[154] In Markevich v. Canada, 2003 SCC 9, the Supreme Court of Canada identified the important purpose of limitation periods as follows, at paragraph 17 of that decision:\n\u2026 Limitation periods, on the other hand, are meant to promote certainty, avoid stale evidence, encourage diligence, and bring repose: see M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at p. 29, per La Forest J. \u2026\n[155] The Respondent is relying on a rule the purpose of which is to relieve a person faced with a deadline to do something\u2013such as object to or appeal from an assessment\u2013from breaching that deadline because the deadline falls on a holiday.\n[156] A taxpayer filing a waiver is not facing a deadline that would preclude the taxpayer from doing anything. A waiver is valid \u201conly if\u201d it is filed within the normal reassessment period. The deadline relates solely to the validity of the waiver itself, not to the doing of something by the person filing the waiver.\n[157] In my view, it would be inconsistent with the text, context and purpose of section 26 of the Interpretation Act and of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) to apply section 26 to deem a waiver to have been filed within the normal reassessment period when the benefit of the rule accrues solely to the Minister\u2013a person who has done nothing\u2013and the taxpayer is deprived of an important right under the ITA.\n[158] On the basis of the foregoing, I find nothing in the text, context, and purpose of subparagraph 152(4)(a)(ii) or section 26 of the Interpretation Act that would justify the application of the latter provision to extend indefinitely the normal reassessment period of the 1989 taxation year of CC.\n[159] Consequently, I find that the 1989 Transferor Reassessment was statute\u2011barred and that the amount of that reassessment is not included in the amount determined under subparagraph 160(1)(e)(ii).\nD. The Payment of $382,377 [160] The parties agree that the estate of CC paid $382,377 to the CRA on or about September 19, 2003. The Respondent says that the Minister applied this payment to reduce CC\u2019s liability under the ITA for his 1988 taxation year. The Appellant submits that there is no evidence to support this and requests that the Court direct that the payment reduce the amount owed by CC for his 1988 taxation year.\n[161] Given my conclusion that the Disputed CC Reassessments are statute\u2011barred, the application of the payment to reduce CC\u2019s liability for his 1988 taxation year is moot. In any event, the proper application of the payment to reduce a tax debt of CC is a collection matter that is outside this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.[49]\nV. Conclusion [162] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal from the Assessment is allowed with costs to the Appellant, and the Assessment is referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the reassessments of the 1988 and 1989 taxation years of CC by notices dated April 21, 1994 were statute\u2011barred.\n[163] The parties shall have 60 days from the date of this judgment to agree on costs. If no agreement is reached, the Appellant shall have a further 30 days to submit written submissions on costs. The Respondent shall have a further 30 days to provide written submissions in response to the Appellant\u2019s submissions. The written submissions of each party are not to exceed 10 pages.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 18th day of January 2024.\n\u201cJ.R.

The Minister of National Revenue allowed motor vehicle expenses but denied expenses of $25,748 and $24,559 for the 2016 and 2017 taxation years, respectively.\n[4] The Minister relied on a number of assumptions of fact that I will summarize as follows:\na)The Appellant owned 49% of the shares of a company known as Entreprises Larry Chauffage Gaz Naturel Inc. He was also an officer and director of this company as well as an employee;\nb)For the 2016 taxation year, the Appellant reported total employment income of $80,110 including $32,500 as commission income;\nc)For the 2017 taxation year, the Appellant reported total employment income of $90,516 including $35,500 as commission income;\nd)From the employment expenses claimed by the Appellant, the sum of $20,000 alleged to have been paid to Liette Robillard for each of the 2016 and 2017 taxation years, was not incurred by the Appellant. And further, the sums of $5,748 and $4,599 alleged to have been paid to Fernand Doucet for the 2016 and 2017 taxation years, respectively, were not incurred by the Appellant;\ne)The Appellant did not have a contract with either these individuals;\nf)The Appellant did not submit any other details and documents that clearly demonstrate that he paid commissions (or salaries) to Liette Robillard and Fernand Doucet, or that a working relationship existed between them, such as: proof of payments, tasks description, timesheets, employee log book, T4 slips, etc.\nII - Burden of Proof in Tax Matters\n[5] I have set out these factual assumptions because of the nature of tax litigation and the burden of proof as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hickson Motors Ltd. v. Canada, 1997 2 S.C.R. 336 (\u201cHickson Motors\u201d). Those principles were later summarized by the Federal Court of Appeal in House v. Canada, 2011 FCA 234 (\u201cHouse v. Canada\u201d) as follows:\nThe burden of proof in taxation cases is that of the balance of probabilities.\nWith regard to the assumptions on which the Minister relies for the assessment, the taxpayer has the initial onus to \u201cdemolish\u201d the assumptions.\nThe taxpayer will have met his initial onus when he or she makes a prima facie case.\nOnce the taxpayer has established a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the Minister, who must rebut the taxpayer\u2019s prima facie case by proving, on a balance of probabilities, his assumptions;\nIf the Minister fails to adduce satisfactory evidence, the taxpayer will succeed.\n[6] The Federal Court of Appeal then indicated that \u201ca prima facie case is one that is supported by evidence which raises such a degree of probability in its favour that it must be accepted if believed by the Court unless it is rebutted or the contrary is proved.\u201d In the end, whether a taxpayer is able to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumptions and establish a degree of probability in his or her favour will often depend on the Court\u2019s finding of credibility. The Court must ask itself if the taxpayer has adduced credible testimonial and documentary evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Minister\u2019s assumptions are incorrect in law and in fact.\n[7] I will add that the onus on the taxpayer does not shift to the Minister unless the taxpayer has established a prima facie case. If the taxpayer has not done so, the onus does not shift to the Crown, nor is there any obligation on the Minister to adduce contrary evidence or what the Appellant has referred to as a contrepreuve.\nIII \u2013 Motion to Strike\n[8] To provide some context, I will start by reviewing the Respondent\u2019s preliminary motion to strike certain paragraphs of the Notice of Appeal. The motion was granted because the Court agreed that many paragraphs raised issues of CRA conduct as a basis for requesting that the reassessment should be quashed.\n[9] As noted at the hearing, the case law has repeatedly held that CRA conduct is not relevant to the validity of an assessment made under the Act. In Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd, v. The Queen, 2004 FCA 403, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Tax Court of Canada does not have the jurisdiction to set aside an assessment on the basis of any abuse of process at common law or in breach of the Charter \u2013 and this is because the issue in an appeal is the validity of the assessment and not the process by which it was established. Put another way, the question is not whether CRA officials exercised their powers properly, but whether the amounts assessed can be shown to be properly owing under the Act.\n[10] Similarly, in JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2013 FCA 250, the Federal Court of Appeal stated at paragraph 83 that the Tax Court of Canada \u201cdoes not have jurisdiction on an appeal to set aside an assessment on the basis of reprehensible conduct by the Minister leading up to the assessment, such as abuse of power or unfairness\u201d and further \u201cif an assessment is correct on the facts and the law, the taxpayer is liable for the tax.\u201d\n[11] In this instance, I was not able to discern any conduct on the part of CRA officials that could be characterized as reprehensible. Requesting documentation in the context of an audit is not improper and is in fact the level of due diligence that would be expected of officials who are charged with the administration of the Act.\n[12] Having concluded that CRA conduct is not relevant to the validity of an assessment, I will nonetheless address two objections made by the Appellant.\nIV - Appellant\u2019s Obligation to Provide Supporting Documentation\n[13] The first objection raised by the agent for the Appellant is that he had no obligation to produce any documentation pursuant to sections 231.1 and 231.2 of the Act.\n[14] Although the evidence suggests that he did produce some documentation, including a form T2200, joint bank account statements as well as an invoice and receipt from Fernand Doucet, the Appellant thereafter took the position that there was no obligation to provide any further documentation.\n[15] The Appellant relied on Duma Construction Company Limited vs HMTQ, a 1974 decision of the Alberta District Court. It was argued that this decision supports the proposition that a taxpayer has no legal obligation to provide any documentation to the Minister. The obligation is only to ensure it is available for inspection.\n[16] I note that the decision in question involved the Minister\u2019s power to compel the production of documents by a third party pursuant to subsections 231(3) and 238(2) of the Act, as they existed at that time. That case involved a criminal prosecution.\n[17] The difficulty is that this appeal does not involve a criminal prosecution of a third party. It is a civil matter and involves a reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s tax returns.\n[18] As a general proposition, it is important to appreciate that the consequences flowing from a taxpayer\u2019s refusal to provide further supporting documentation for amounts claimed in a tax return, is that the reassessment will likely be confirmed by the Minister, as was done in this instance, leading to this appeal.\n[19] Furthermore, a taxpayer\u2019s refusal to provide documents during the audit stage does not obviate the necessity of doing so at the hearing of the appeal where the taxpayer has the burden of establishing a prima facie case and demolishing the Minister\u2019s assumptions as established in Hickson Motors, cited above.\n[20] I conclude that this position has no merit and should be rejected.\nV - The Minister\u2019s Obligation to Provide Documents\n[21] The second objection is that the reassessment should be quashed because the Minister failed to provide the documentation requested pursuant to paragraphs 241(4)(a) and (b) of the Act.\n[22] I note at the outset that the object of section 241 is the protection of confidential taxpayer information. It prevents an official from divulging private and confidential taxpayer information to third parties.\n[23] Subsection 241(4) provides various exceptions as to when an official may \u201cprovide taxpayer information.\u201d Paragraph (a) refers to providing \u201cto any person taxpayer information\u201d required in the \u201cadministration or enforcement of the Act\u201d and paragraph (b) refers to providing \u201cto any person taxpayer information\u201d for the purpose of \u201cdetermining any tax, interest or penalty or other amount that might be available to the taxpayer as a credit or refund\u201d.\n[24] I find that the use of the word \u201cperson\u201d refers to third parties who may request confidential \u201ctaxpayer information\u201d and not to the taxpayer in question. In other words, subsection 241(4) is not intended as an instrument to gather information about a taxpayer\u2019s own file. That was not the intent of Parliament.\n[25] When the reassessment was confirmed on April 13, 2021, it was based on the Minister\u2019s conclusion that the documentation provided was inadequate such that it is not clear what other documentation could have been disclosed by CRA officials following a request pursuant to paragraphs 241(4)(a) and (b).\n[26] It is apparent the Appellant could have made an access to information request but there is no evidence he did so. In any event, the evidence suggests that the Appellant was provided with the form T401 Report on Objection containing a full explanation as to why the reassessment was confirmed.\n[27] I thus conclude that this argument has no merit and must also be rejected.\n1st Issue: The first substantive issue to be determined is whether the Appellant was entitled to claim a deduction of $20,000 allegedly paid to his spouse?\n[28] The Appellant testified on his own behalf. He was in the business of selling air conditioners, furnaces and heat pumps or other such related appliances under the brand name of Lennox. He had a contractual arrangement with Costco and an exclusive territory. At the Costco entrance, there was a kiosque with blank preprinted forms that prospective clients could fill out to express their interest.\n[29] These forms were collected and calls were made to qualify the prospective purchasers. If qualified, an appointment was scheduled. The Appellant met the prospective client and submitted a proposal. If it was accepted, a contract was signed and the Appellant was entitled to a commission.\n[30] The Appellant claims that Liette Robillard made the calls and scheduled the appointments and was paid for her services as a self-employed person. It is admitted that she was not paid directly but it is argued that the following amounts were paid to her indirectly including $34,918 in 2016 and $31,417 in 2017.\n[31] The Appellant claims that these amounts were paid as her share of mortgage payments, cash withdrawals or other debit transactions from a joint bank account. He produced bank statements to supports these alleged payments.\n[32] During cross-examinations, the Appellant admitted that he had not kept any records of the payments made to his spouse and that, although the amount claimed was less that the amount alleged to have been paid to her, he had no understanding as to how it had been quantified. He relied on his accountant to determine the appropriate amount to be claimed. He also admitted that the cash withdrawals and debit transactions were for ordinary household expenses and were not necessarily specific to his spouse. No deposit was made to her personal bank account.\n[33] The Appellant also argued that the determination of an employer-employee relationship or contract with a self-employed person or independent contractor was a matter of provincial law subject to the provisions of the Civil Code of Quebec, (C.c.Q.) and that article 1683 applied. It provides as follows:\nWhere the qualities of creditor and debtor are united in the same person, confusion is effected, extinguishing the obligation. Nevertheless, in certain cases where confusion ceases to exist, the effect ceases also.\n[34] The Respondent made a number of arguments as follows:\nThere was no evidence that the alleged $20,000 payment was incurred or actually paid to Liette Robillard;\nAny amounts that are alleged to have been paid to Liette Robillard were in fact joint family expenses not directly related to her;\nThere was no evidence of any services performed by Liette Robillard and the Appellant could not produce a log or note book or list of customers allegedly contacted by her at any time in 2016 or 2017;\nThe Appellant failed to maintain proper Books and Records as required by subsection 230(1) of the Act;\nArticle 1683 of the C.c.Q. did not apply because there was no evidence that Liette Robillard was a creditor;\nThe Appellant failed to demolish the Minister\u2019s assumptions.\n[35] This was addressed in Burlando c. HMTQ, 2014 TCC 92 where a husband argued it would make no sense for him to pay his wife by cheque to be deposited in a joint bank account. Justice Miller rejected this argument noting at paragraph 12 that \u201cwhere there is an alleged working relationship between non-arm\u2019s length parties, there should have been some documentation or independent evidence to support the working relationship.\u201d\n[36] Similarly, in Blott v. The Queen, 2018 TCC 1, Justice Campbell dealt with an alleged contractual relationship between a husband and wife. He concluded at paragraphs 13-14 that there was no evidence of the services rendered, no set hours or schedule and that the evidence was \u201csimply too vague to support a working employment relationship\u201d. I find this reasoning would apply if the claim had been that the taxpayer\u2019s wife was an independent contractor.\n[37] In closing submissions, it was argued that there was no need to produce an actual contract and the Appellant\u2019s testimony was sufficient to establish the status of his wife as an independent contractor and the amounts paid to her. It was argued further that the Respondent had not produced a contrepreuve.\n[38] I find that these argument must be rejected and agree with the Respondent that there are no books and records and no supporting documentation. The Appellant\u2019s testimony alone is not sufficient to rebut the Minister\u2019s assumption that the amounts claimed were neither incurred nor actually paid to Liette Robillard.\n[39] On that basis, I find that the Minister correctly denied the expenses. If this raises an issue of double taxation, it may be possible for her to file a T1 Adjustment to reduce the income reported during the subject taxation years.\n2nd Issue: The second substantive issue to be determined by the Court is whether the Appellant was entitled to claim a deduction for the amounts alleged to have been paid to Fernand Doucet for each of the 2016 and 2017 taxation years?\n[40] The Appellant testified that Mr. Doucet was well known in the area as a \u201cscrapper\u201d in that his work involved the removal of old furnaces, heating systems or air conditioning units used primarily in schools or churches. Although it was not explained, these items were presumably sold for parts or as scrap metal.\n[41] If Mr. Doucet referred a potential sales opportunity and the Appellant was able to submit a proposal for a Lennox system and obtain a contract, he was entitled to a referral fee. The amount was not a fixed percentage and depended on the nature of the referral and profit potential of the sales opportunity for the Appellant.\n[42] As explained by the Appellant, Mr. Doucet was not an employee or a sub-contractor. He was merely a free-agent who sometimes made referrals.\n[43] Mr. Doucet did not testify but the Appellant produced an invoice from him dated December 1, 2016 for $5,000 plus GST and QST. A second invoice for $4,000, plus GST and QST dated December 17, 2017 was also adduced. The invoices were standard pre-printed forms that referred to \u201clabour and materials\u201d. There was a manuscript note indicating \u201csolicitation\u201d but no other handwritten notes were legible. No further details as to the number or nature of the referrals was provided.\n[44] The Appellant also submitted a receipt allegedly signed by Fernand Doucet to acknowledge receipt of a cash payment of $5,748 from the Appellant \u201cpour la solicitation de clientele potentielle dans la region de Laval et Laurentides.\u201d There was no indication as to when or where the receipt was signed but it was titled December 30, 2016. A second receipt was provided for a cash payment of $4,599. It contained the same language to explain the payment and was titled December 30, 2017.\n[45] When asked when the receipts were signed, the Appellant referred to the dates of the receipt.The Appellant was unable to provide any other proof of payment such as a cancelled cheque because that the amounts had been paid to Mr. Doucet with cash on hand that had been accumulated from personal resources and mostly from cash-gifts received from his mother\u2013in-law who had always been very generous.\n[46] The Appellant argued that the invoices each had a GST and QST number such that if CRA had cross checked the information, they could have seen that the amounts had been reported by Mr. Doucet, at least for and GST\/QST purposes.\n[47] It was also argued that the Respondent had not presented any contrepreuve.\n[48] The Respondent raised a number of objections including the fact that Mr. Doucet had not testified, the Appelant\u2019s testimony was uncorroborated and there were no details of the services received, no evidence of the cash payments and no books and records to provide some form of record of the payments.\n[49] The Respondent relied on the recent decision of Pierre Juneau R\u00e9novations Inc. v. HMTQ, 2020 CCI 54 where Justice Masse relied on the earlier decision of Garage Gilles Gingras c. SHMTQ, 2010 TCC 343 where the Court indicated the following:\n[74] Using cash is legal and legitimate, but it does frankly raise scepticism, being a common practice in work under the table, tax avoidance, etc. Cash leaves no or so few traces that a plausible explanation can always be given depending on the context.\n[50] At paragraphs 50 and 51, Justice Masse concludes as follows:\n[50] It is not disputed that the use of cash generally leaves fewer traces. When operating a business, it is the taxpayer's responsibility to keep appropriate books and records. This is an obligation imposed by the Act: (\u2026) In this case, there are no books, no records and no supporting documentation.\n[51] The appellant has not satisfied me through evidence and explanations that are clear, consistent, reasonable and credible that the cheques payable as \"cash\" were associated with the subcontracts.\n[51] In this instance, the Court may reasonably infer that the cash payments were made at the request of Fernand Doucet as the Appellant had nothing to gain from doing so. That being the case, it is difficult to reconcile the request for cash with the signature of a receipt. Why would Fernard Doucet have requested cash and then signed a receipt. The Appellant indicated that the receipt was signed on the date indicated being December 30th, 2016 and December 30th 2017. The Court is left with the impression that the Appellant was not entirely truthful on this issue and that the receipts were likely signed at a later date in order to create a paper-trail in the context of CRA\u2019s request for documentation and the preparation of this appeal.\n[52] The difficulty once again is the lack of details that would allow the Court to determine how the amounts were calculated. The invoices provide few details and are very general in nature. The best that can be said is that the Appellant has produced some \u201csupporting documentation.\u201d\n[53] In the end, the test is whether the Appellant has established on a balance of probabilities that he paid the amounts claimed to Mr. Doucet as a referral fee.

FACTS [1] This is a very unusual matter which arises out of a case management hearing.\n[2] Mr. Mandic was reassessed for unreported income of $266,554 for the 2015 taxation year. A Notice of Appeal was filed by Mr. Mandic in response to the Minister\u2019s reassessment on May 3, 2019. The Reply to the Notice of Appeal was filed on July 15, 2019. Documents were exchanged by the parties and discoveries conducted. A settlement agreement was reached on this matter and both parties signed a consent to judgment stating the reassessment of the taxation year in issue will be vacated. This occurred on April 29, 2021.\n[3] The Tax Court judge who was provided with the consent to judgement took issue with one specific phrase in the agreement. Specifically, in the Minutes of Settlement, the parties asked the Tax Court that the Reassessment of the Appellant\u2019s 2015 taxation year be vacated. The duty judge who received this request returned it to the parties to amend. Pursuant to the direction of the Court, the reassessment was not to be vacated, but referred back to the MNR for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[4] Mr. Mandic died in November 2021, before both parties signed the amended Consent to Judgement with the corrected wording. No person has become the executor of the Appellant\u2019s estate and it appears there is no person directing counsel for the Appellant.\n[5] This Court now must determine how to dispose of the matter, either by issuing an order to allow the Appeal pursuant to the original Minutes of Settlement or disposing of the matter for a lack of prosecution.\nII. ISSUES [6] The issues are as follows:\n- Can the Crown be bound to a settlement agreement, which was agreed to, yet went unsigned due to the death of the Appellant?\n- Does the style of cause need to be amended?\n- If so, what order should this Court issue?\nIII. ANALYSIS A. Allowing the Appeal in accordance with subsection 171(1)\n[7] The Federal Court of Appeal in CBS Holdings outlined the general rule that parties should be bound by the agreements they make, if the Crown enters into a settlement agreement the Crown should be held to the agreement.[1]\n[8] In addition to this general rule, the jurisprudence has established the Tax Court has jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements in accordance with subsection 171(1).[2]\n[9] In the current matter, both parties agreed to and signed the original consent to judgment \u2013 this demonstrates the Crown had an intention to settle the matter and believed a settlement was in its best interest. The death of the Appellant and the lack of an executor for Mr. Mandic\u2019s estate has lead the Crown to take the position that they now are unable to agree to settle this matter. While I am sympathetic to their position, which has been set out in great detail over the course of multiple case management hearings, the Rules do provide me with discretion to reach a just result on this matter.\n[10] This Court has the power to enforce a settlement agreement.[3] In this instance there is no doubt that the parties had an intention to settle this matter and likely would have finalized the settlement but for the Appellant\u2019s death. As such, pursuant to subparagraph 171(1)(b)(iii) this Court should allow the appeal by referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment in accordance with the settlement agreement, with the amendment requested by the Court.\n[11] Other Tax Court of Canada General Procedure rules also grant the presiding judge broad discretion. Rule 4(1) states that the Rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits.\n[12] Rule 9 allows the Court to dispense with compliance with the rules where it is in the interest of justice.\n[13] Finally, pursuant to subsection 126(4)(e), a case management judge may make any order that is considered just in the circumstances.\nB. Rule 29 of the Tax Court Rules (General Procedure)\n[14] A potential issue that should be addressed is whether the Appellant is in compliance with Rule 29 of the Tax Court Rules. Subsequent to the death of the Appellant, no person has taken the role of executor of the estate nor has the interest of the Appellant in this matter been transferred to a party with capacity.\n[15] Rule 29 concerns the transfer of interest in a proceeding before the Court. Rule 29 specifically contemplates the death of an appellant taxpayer as a circumstance which would necessitate a transferring of interest.\n[16] Sub rules 29(1) \u2013 29(3) provide the steps required to amend a style of cause to reflect the transfer of interest in a style of cause due to the death of a taxpayer. First, the party requiring the transfer of interest must notify the Registrar and provide particulars as to why the transfer or amendment of style of cause is needed. Next, upon receipt of notice and the particulars, the Registrar will consult with the parties regarding how the proceedings will continue and report to the Chief Justice. Finally, once the above two steps have been met the Chief Justice, or designated judge with charge over the matter, may give directions on how to proceed.\nC. Disposition regarding Rule 29\n[17] The Appellant has not fulfilled the requisite steps in accordance with Rule 29.\n[18] Subrule 29(3) gives me discretion to give such other direction as just. In exercising this authority, I direct that the style of cause in this matter be amended to The Estate of Vladimir Mandic v. His Majesty the King.\nD. Conclusion\n[19] The style of cause in this matter shall be amended to The Estate of Vladimir Mandic v. His Majesty the King.\n[20] The Appeal should be allowed in accordance with the terms of the April 29, 2021 settlement agreement with the appropriate amendment requested by the Court, specifically that matter not be vacated but referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment.\n[21] Both parties will be responsible for their own costs.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 26th day of June 2024.\n\u201cR.

HILL,\nAppellant,\nand\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING,\nRespondent.\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nGraham J.\n[1] Teresa Hill is a Haudenosaunee Iroquois Confederacy Treaty Indian from the Six Nations of Grand River. She lives on the Six Nations reserve and works as a unit clerk at the West Haldimand General Hospital in Hagersville, Ontario (the \u201cHospital\u201d).\n[2] Ms. Hill takes the position that the income she earned from 2013 to 2016 from working at the Hospital was exempt from tax under paragraph 87(1)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[3] Ms. Hill and her agent, Wilfred Davey, both testified. I found them to be credible witnesses. That said, the facts are not really in dispute.\nA. Issue [4] Ms. Hill is an \u201cIndian\u201d within the meaning of the Indian Act. Under paragraph 87(1)(b), the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve is exempt from tax. The employment income of an Indian is personal property (Nowegijick v. The Queen[1]). Therefore, Ms. Hill\u2019s employment income from her work at the Hospital was exempt from tax if it was situated on the Six Nations reserve.\nB. Williams Test [5] In Williams v. The Queen,[2] the Supreme Court of Canada held that whether income is situated on a reserve is determined based on whether there are sufficient connecting factors to the reserve. The Court set out a two-step test. First, identify the potentially relevant connecting factors. Then, analyze those factors to determine what weight should be given to them.\nC. Potentially Relevant Factors [6] In Bastien v. The Queen,[3] the Supreme Court emphasized that, in considering potential connecting factors, it is essential to consider the type of income in question. The list of connecting factors relevant to one type of income will not necessarily be the same as the list of factors for another type of income.[4]\n[7] The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the purpose of subsection 87(1) is to \u201cpreserve the entitlement of Indians to their reserve lands and to ensure that the use of their property on their reserve lands [is] not eroded by the ability of governments to tax, or creditors to seize\u201d. Its purpose is \u201cnot to confer a general economic benefit\u201d upon Indians.[5] It is that purpose that I must consider when deciding what factors are relevant.\n[8] In Morriseau v. The Queen, Justice Sommerfeldt set out the following five connecting factors as ones that the case law has identified as being potentially relevant in the context of employment income:[6]\na)the residence of the employer;\nb)the residence of the employee;\nc)the location where the employee is paid;\nd)the location where the work is performed; and\ne)the nature of the services performed or the special circumstances in which they are performed.\n[9] I find that these connecting factors are relevant to Ms. Hill\u2019s employment. I will now consider them.\nEmployer\u2019s Residence\n[10] There was no evidence regarding the residence of the Hospital. Notably, there was no suggestion that the central management and control of the Hospital occurred on the Six Nations reserve. This factor argues for taxation.\nEmployee\u2019s Residence\n[11] Ms. Hill lives on the Six Nations reserve about a 10 minute drive from the Hospital. This factor argues for exemption from taxation.\nPlace Where Payment Occurs\n[12] Ms. Hill is paid by direct deposit to her bank account on the reserve. This factor argues for exemption from taxation.\nLocation of Work\n[13] Ms. Hill performed the vast majority of her work at the Hospital. I do not consider the fact that she occasionally brought some scheduling work home with her to be material.\n[14] The fact that Ms. Hill performed her work off the reserve argues for taxation.\n[15] Although the Hospital is located within one kilometer of the boundary of the Six Nations reserve, it is not on the reserve. The Hospital is located on private land (the \u201cHospital Land\u201d). Mr. Davey testified that his review of the abstract of the Hospital Land indicated that the registered owner of the land donated it to the Hospital in 1961.\n[16] Ms. Hill takes the position that the Hospital Land belongs to the Six Nations, having been given to them in 1784 under the Haldimand Proclamation in recognition of their service to the Crown during the American Revolution. She submits that Haldimand Proclamation gave the Six Nations all land within 6 miles of the Grand River - a massive swath of land that Mr. Davey described as being approximately 9,000,000 acres, only 5% of which is covered by the Six Nations reserve.\n[17] Mr. Davey testified that the Hospital Lands lie within 6 miles of the Grand River. He produced a Google Earth map showing the distance.[7] While I accepted the map into evidence, on a more detailed review of it, I am left uncertain whether the Hospital Lands fall within 6 miles of the Grand River. I am, however, certain that I cannot rely on the map to reach that conclusion. The map states that the distance from the Hospital Lands to the Grand River is \u201c13,516.70 meters 2.55 miles\u201d. This combination of imperial and metric measurements makes no sense. One does not measure a distance in a combination of imperial and metric measurements. It cannot be that the map is providing the measurements in both systems as 13,516.70 metres is equal to approximately 8.4 miles. While it is difficult to read, the map appears to have a scale in the bottom right corner which suggests that the 13.5 km measurement is more likely to be accurate. Based on the foregoing, I am not satisfied that the Hospital Lands actually fall within the land covered by the Haldimand Proclamation. That said, I have not been asked to make that determination.\n[18] Ms. Hill says that the Hospital Land was improperly taken from the Six Nations by the Crown in the mid-1800s. Ms. Hill is not asking me to decide whether the Hospital Land rightfully belongs to the Six Nations. She recognizes that a Tax Court of Canada informal procedure appeal is not the appropriate forum to resolve that issue.\n[19] Ms. Hill is also not arguing that the Hospital Land is part of the Six Nations reserve. The term \u201creserve\u201d is defined in subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act as a tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in His Majesty, that has been set apart by His Majesty for the use and benefit of a band. Since legal title to the Hospital Land is not vested in His Majesty (even though Ms. Hill\u2019s position is that it should be), it is not a reserve.\n[20] What Ms. Hill is essentially asking is that I recognize that she performs her work on what I will call \u201cdisputed land\u201d. For the purposes of this appeal, I am prepared to accept the Hospital is located on disputed land. However, as explained in more detail below, I find that the fact that the Hospital is located on disputed land does not, in itself, outweigh the fact that it is not on the Six Nations reserve and thus that the location-of-work factor argues for taxation.\nNature of Services Performed or Special Circumstances\n[21] Ms. Hill did not point to anything about the nature of the services she performs or the operations of the Hospital that would connect her services to the reserve.\n[22] As a unit clerk, Ms. Hill processes doctors\u2019 orders, answers phones and call bells, does scheduling, orders supplies, relieves others on switchboard duties, and moves beds if needed.\n[23] There was no evidence to suggest that the bulk of the Hospital\u2019s patients came from the reserve. Ms. Hill testified that maybe three of the Hospital\u2019s approximately 100 employees live on the Six Nations reserve.\n[24] The Hospital is a smaller hospital that serves the surrounding community, including people who live on the reserve. Ms. Hill believes the Hospital began operating in 1953. There has not been a hospital on the reserve since 1968.\n[25] The Hospital is one of five hospitals in the area. My understanding is that people living on the Six Nations reserve will generally go to whichever hospital is closest to where they live. Ms. Hill explained that one of the other hospitals is at the other end of the reserve and that the remaining three are approximately a 40 to 45 minute drive from the reserve.\n[26] The Hospital has 23 in-patient beds and an emergency department with 9 to 10 beds. There is a long term care facility on the second floor of the Hospital that operates independently from the Hospital. Patients with more serious issues are generally transferred to a larger hospital in the region. Ms. Hill explained that most of those patients are sent to Hamilton.\n[27] There was no evidence to suggest that the Hospital receives specific federal funding or, if so, that that funding was by virtue of its proximity to the reserve or services it provides to people on the reserve.\n[28] Ms. Hill testified that in the last year the Hospital has started having ceremonies led by Six Nations members which staff, volunteers, patients and others were welcome to attend. As these ceremonies occurred well outside of the years in question, I do not have to consider them. That said, since Ms. Hill continues to work for the Hospital, I will say that, had the ceremonies occurred during the years in question, it would not have changed my overall decision on her appeal. The ceremonies neither change the nature of Ms. Hill\u2019s work nor of the Hospital itself.\nRelationship Between the Income and Life on the Reserve\n[29] In Bastien, the Supreme Court identified that the relationship between the income and life on the reserve may, in some cases, be something that strengthens or weakens connecting factors but is not a factor in itself.\n[30] There was no evidence to suggest any sort of relationship between Ms. Hill\u2019s employment at the Hospital and life on the reserve. In the circumstances of this case, I consider this to be neutral rather than something that weakens other connecting factors.\nD. Weight of the Factors [31] In weighing the connecting factors, I give moderate weight to Ms. Hill\u2019s residence and that of her employer and significant weight to the location and nature of her work. I give little weight to the place of payment. Based on this weighing, I find that Ms. Hill\u2019s employment income was taxable.\n[32] Ms. Hill submits that I should give considerable weight to the fact that the Hospital is on disputed land. That fact might have been relevant if the nature of Ms. Hill\u2019s work had been closely tied to the reserve but, in the circumstances, I attach little significance to it. To give that fact weight by itself would effectively re-draw the boundaries of the Six Nations reserve for the purposes of subsection 87(1) such that any employment occurring within 6 miles of the Grand River would occur on the Six Nations reserve.\n[33] Ms. Hill says that I should follow the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Folster v. The Queen.[8] Folster considered a case where an employee who resided on a reserve worked at a hospital off the reserve. The Court held that the employee\u2019s income was exempt from tax.\n[34] I find Folster to be helpful but not in the way the Ms. Hill intends. The facts in Folster are very different from those in Ms. Hill\u2019s case and illustrate the importance of the nature of the employee\u2019s work. In particular, there was significant evidence that Ms. Folster\u2019s work was closely tied to the reserve. The hospital in Folster had been located on the reserve until it burned down and was rebuilt adjacent to the reserve. The government was in the process of designating that land as part of the reserve and had previously considered income earned working in the hospital to be exempt. The hospital primarily served the reserve community. Approximately 80% of the hospital\u2019s patients were Indians. Ms. Folster was employed by the federal government and the Court held that the payments were \u201cadvanced as part of the Crown\u2019s responsibility for the health care of Indians and, in particular, the health of Indians on the Norway House Indian Reserve\u201d.[9]\n[35] Ms. Hill also relies on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Robertson v. The Queen[10] for the proposition that income earned off-reserve can nonetheless be exempt. I do not find Robertson helpful. In Robertson, the taxpayers earned business income, not employment income and thus the relevant connecting factors were very different than those applied to employment income.\nE. Conclusion [36] Based on all of the foregoing, the appeal is dismissed.\nF. Additional Arguments [37] Ms. Hill\u2019s notice of appeal raised a number of other issues (including the application of section 35 of the Constitution Act). Ms. Hill abandoned all arguments other than the application of subsection 87(1) at the beginning of trial.\nG. Additional Years [38] Ms. Hill\u2019s notice of appeal also raised a number of other tax years. The Respondent had intended to argue that the appeals of Ms. Hill\u2019s 1993 to 2011 tax years and her 2017 and 2018 tax years should be quashed as the necessary preconditions for appealing had not been met. At the beginning of trial, Ms. Hill accepted that her appeal only dealt with her 2013 to 2016 tax years. It was unclear to me whether she had originally intended to appeal the other years or not. For certainty, I will quash the appeals of Ms. Hill\u2019s 1993 to 2011 tax years and her 2017 and 2018 tax years.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 5th day of July 2024.\n\u201cDavid E.Graham\u201d\nGraham J.\nCITATION:\n2024 TCC 92\nCOURT FILE NO.:\n2020-1856(IT)I\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTERESA A.

Contexte\n[1] Lors de l\u2019audition au fond des appels des requ\u00e9rants, ces derniers se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce que les documents mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. La Cour a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur les objections des requ\u00e9rants, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e par ces derniers qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9senteraient, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition des appels, une requ\u00eate pour l\u2019exclusion de ces documents.\n[2] Les documents en litige proviennent d\u2019une perquisition qui a eu lieu le 25 janvier 2012, en vertu de l\u2019article 487 du Code criminel, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de SPE, de SPE Affacturage Inc. et de SPEQ SPE Technologies, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Saint\u2011Georges de Beauce, et \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de M. Plante et de sa conjointe Mme Julie Grenier, \u00e9galement situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Saint\u2011Georges de Beauce. La Cour et les parties ont qualifi\u00e9 les objections d\u2019\u00ab objections parapluie \u00bb.\n[3] Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir que les documents en litige doivent \u00eatre exclus de la preuve en vertu du paragraphe 24(2) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (\u00ab Charte \u00bb). Ils font valoir que la ministre du Revenu national (la \u00ab ministre \u00bb) ne peut utiliser pour \u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants, des documents obtenus en vertu d\u2019un mandat de perquisition. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, l\u2019admission de ces documents en preuve contreviendrait aux articles 7 et 8 de la Charte.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que les documents doivent \u00eatre inclus en preuve. Lesdits documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus en vertu d\u2019un mandat de perquisition valide selon l\u2019article 487 du Code criminel. Le mandat de perquisition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par les requ\u00e9rants.\n[5] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que la ministre pouvait s\u2019appuyer sur ces documents afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en preuve de ces documents dans les appels des requ\u00e9rants ne contrevient pas aux articles 7 et 8 de la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents sont admissibles en preuve afin de d\u00e9terminer si les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par la ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants sont correctes en fait et en droit.\nII. Les faits\n[6] En f\u00e9vrier 2006, l\u2019Agence du Revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb) entreprend une v\u00e9rification fiscale de certaines personnes ayant acquis des licences de SPE.\n[7] Cette v\u00e9rification fiscale est par la suite \u00e9tendue \u00e0 M. Plante ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 SPE.\n[8] Mme Drew, v\u00e9rificatrice au bureau de l\u2019Est du Qu\u00e9bec de l\u2019ARC, commence sa v\u00e9rification des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants au d\u00e9but de 2007. Le 29 avril 2009, Mme Drew envoie une lettre \u00e0 M. Plante et \u00e0 SPE, les avisant que la v\u00e9rification des d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour la p\u00e9riode de 2004 \u00e0 2006 est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. Dans la lettre, elle demande \u00e9galement aux requ\u00e9rants de lui faire parvenir des commentaires quant aux redressements propos\u00e9s. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Mme Drew n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes am\u00e9ricaines les relev\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s par la Division de l\u2019\u00e9vitement fiscal de l\u2019ARC.\n[9] Mme Morin remplace Mme Drew \u00e0 titre de v\u00e9rificatrice. Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les dossiers, et \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9ception en juin et en ao\u00fbt 2009 de documents des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes am\u00e9ricaines, Mme Morin pr\u00e9pare en novembre 2009 un Renvoi T134, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle transf\u00e8re le dossier de SPE et de M. Plante aux enqu\u00eates criminelles pour examen.\n[10] Les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants sont assign\u00e9s en d\u00e9cembre 2009 \u00e0 M. Potvin, enqu\u00eateur de la Division de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution (enqu\u00eates criminelles\/p\u00e9nales) au bureau de l\u2019Est de Qu\u00e9bec de l\u2019ARC (\u00ab Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles \u00bb).\n[11] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019analyse des dossiers, l\u2019ARC a des motifs raisonnables de croire que M. Plante, SPE et d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont, ensemble ou s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations fausses ou trompeuses dans le but d\u2019\u00e9luder ou de tenter d\u2019\u00e9luder l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable ou permettre \u00e0 des tiers de le faire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Potvin pr\u00e9pare une d\u00e9nonciation en vue d\u2019obtenir des mandats de perquisition selon l\u2019article 487 du Code criminel.\n[12] Le 12 janvier 2012, des mandats de perquisition sont obtenus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Plante et de SPE. Les mandats autorisent les enqu\u00eateurs de l\u2019ARC \u00e0 perquisitionner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de SPE, de SPE Affacturage inc., de SPEQ SPE Technologies et \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence personnelle de M. Plante et de sa conjointe Mme Julie Grenier.\n[13] Les mandats sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s le 25 janvier 2012. Les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont jamais contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 des mandats de perquisition.\n[14] Le 14 mars 2012, M. Longchamps, de la Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles, \u00e9crit \u00e0 SPE, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 M. Plante et \u00e0 Mme Grenier, les avisant qu\u2019une juge de paix de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec a sign\u00e9, en date du 13 mars 2012, une ordonnance de d\u00e9tention de documents en vertu de l\u2019article 490 du Code criminel, laquelle ordonnance permettait \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de d\u00e9tenir les choses saisies jusqu\u2019au 25 avril 2012. Sont aussi jointes aux lettres du 14 mars 2012 les annexes du rapport \u00e0 un juge de paix, qui contiennent l\u2019inventaire des choses saisies lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du mandat de perquisition. M. Longchamps avise aussi les requ\u00e9rants qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate approfondie est en cours et que les choses saisies pourront \u00eatre requises en cour comme preuve de la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019une infraction au sens de l\u2019article 239 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb).\n[15] Des prolongations de la d\u00e9tention des choses saisies sont demand\u00e9es par l\u2019ARC \u00e0 deux reprises, soit en mars et en d\u00e9cembre 2012. La derni\u00e8re demande est dat\u00e9e du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2012, M. Plante consent \u00e0 la prolongation de la d\u00e9tention des choses saisies par l\u2019ARC.\n[16] Fin d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019ARC ferme la Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles du bureau de l\u2019Est du Qu\u00e9bec. M. Potvin est mut\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division de la v\u00e9rification du bureau de l\u2019Est du Qu\u00e9bec. \u00c0 titre de v\u00e9rificateur, M. Potvin devient responsable du volet civil des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants.\n[17] Le 21 janvier 2013, M. Potvin envoie \u00e0 M. Plante une lettre l\u2019avisant que l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de SPE a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e. Une demande d\u2019ordonnance de remise des choses saisies, selon le paragraphe 490(5) du Code criminel, est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants le 21 janvier 2013 devant la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec afin que les choses saisies soient remises aux requ\u00e9rants.\n[18] La d\u00e9cision d\u2019abandonner l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle repose sur une \u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts\/b\u00e9n\u00e9fices par l\u2019\u00e9quipe de M. Potvin.\n[19] Le 1er octobre 2013, M. Potvin avise SPE et M. Plante que la v\u00e9rification est termin\u00e9e quant aux d\u00e9clarations de revenus de 2005 \u00e0 2009, que des nouvelles cotisations seront \u00e9tablies et qu\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 sera impos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la LIR.\n[20] En octobre 2013, des avis de nouvelle cotisation sont \u00e9tablis par la Ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains des licenci\u00e9s de SPE Valeur Assurable Inc., dont M. Claude Lessard et M. \u00c9ric Gilbert, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Plante et de SPE. En \u00e9tablissant les nouvelles cotisations, la ministre s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e notamment sur certains des documents obtenus lors des perquisitions, documents qui sont vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[21] Il ressort du t\u00e9moignage de M. Potvin que, lorsqu\u2019un enqu\u00eateur accepte un dossier du service de la v\u00e9rification, il traite autant l\u2019aspect p\u00e9nal du dossier que l\u2019aspect civil. C\u2019est l\u2019enqu\u00eateur qui m\u00e8ne le dossier \u00e0 terme. Selon M. Potvin, cela va de soi, car l\u2019enqu\u00eateur doit calculer le montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9lud\u00e9 dans le cas d\u2019une infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 239 de la LIR.\n[22] La preuve a aussi \u00e9tabli que lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle, les v\u00e9rificateurs et enqu\u00eateurs de l\u2019ARC n\u2019ont pas utilis\u00e9 les pouvoirs civils pr\u00e9vus aux articles 231.1 (inspection) et 231.2 (demande p\u00e9remptoire) de la LIR\nIII. Questions en litige\n[23] Est-ce que les documents vis\u00e9s par les \u00ab objections parapluie \u00bb sont admissibles en preuve dans les appels des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants? Est-ce que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces documents en preuve contrevient aux articles 7 et 8 de la Charte?\nIV. Arguments des parties et analyse\n[24] Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir que les documents obtenus lors de la perquisition doivent \u00eatre exclus de la preuve en vertu du paragraphe 24(2) de la Charte. Ils font valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut d\u00e9poser en preuve les documents obtenus au moyen de la perquisition, car ils avaient une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces documents. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en preuve de ces documents contrevient aux articles 7 et 8 de la Charte. La ministre ne pouvait s\u2019appuyer sur ces documents afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des nouvelles cotisations. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut d\u00e9poser ces documents dans le cadre des appels des requ\u00e9rants relatifs aux nouvelles cotisations, et ce, notamment pour les motifs suivants :\n(i) L\u2019ARC aurait utilis\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle afin faire progresser la v\u00e9rification.\n(ii) L\u2019ARC ne pouvait faire \u00e0 des fins civiles des photocopies des documents saisis durant l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n(iii) Fusion des pouvoirs entre la v\u00e9rification et l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n(iv) L\u2019ARC ne pouvait utiliser \u00e0 des fins civiles, dont l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations, les documents obtenus lors d\u2019une perquisition effectu\u00e9e aux fins d\u2019une enqu\u00eate sur des infractions criminelles.\n(v) Lors de la perquisition, l\u2019ARC a saisi des documents personnels qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec les transactions en litige. De plus, les documents saisis n\u2019auraient pas pu \u00eatre obtenus lors d\u2019une v\u00e9rification, car ces documents sont des courriels de tierces personnes. De plus, les requ\u00e9rants avaient une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces documents. Ainsi, il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des requ\u00e9rants, ce qui contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la Charte.\n(i) L\u2019ARC aurait utilis\u00e9 la perquisition criminelle afin de faire progresser la v\u00e9rification.\n[25] Les requ\u00e9rants indiquent qu\u2019ils ne contestent pas le mandat de perquisition. Cela \u00e9tant dit, ils plaident que le mandat de perquisition aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu afin de faire progresser la v\u00e9rification. Cet argument ne tient pas. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la Cour me permettant de conclure que l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte pour obtenir des documents aux fins de la v\u00e9rification. Au contraire, M. Potvin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les documents obtenus dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification, y inclus les documents des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes, il avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que des infractions \u00e0 la LIR avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par M. Plante et SPE. Cela \u00e9tant, des mandats de perquisition ont \u00e9t\u00e9 validement d\u00e9cern\u00e9s par un juge de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec en vertu de l\u2019article 487 du Code criminel. Le mandat de perquisition n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par les requ\u00e9rants. [1]\n(ii) L\u2019ARC ne pouvait faire \u00e0 des fins civiles des photocopies des documents saisis durant l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n[26] Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir que les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 photocopi\u00e9s afin que ces derniers servent \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification civile. Les requ\u00e9rants s\u2019appuient sur les faits suivants : le bureau de l\u2019Est du Qu\u00e9bec ferme sa Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles \u00e0 la fin d\u00e9cembre 2012. \u00c0 cette date, M. Potvin est mut\u00e9 \u00e0 la Division de la v\u00e9rification, \u00e0 titre de v\u00e9rificateur. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, les faits \u00e9tablissent que l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e au mois de d\u00e9cembre 2012. Cela prouve, selon les requ\u00e9rants, que la prolongation de la d\u00e9tention des documents demand\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2012 n\u2019a servi qu\u2019\u00e0 gagner du temps afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de photocopier les documents.\n[27] Bien que la Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles ait ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin d\u00e9cembre, les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s que le 23 janvier 2013 que l\u2019enqu\u00eate avait \u00e9tait abandonn\u00e9e. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants pour appuyer ce qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9tendent. Ils se fondent sur des hypoth\u00e8ses et soup\u00e7ons. Cet argument n\u2019a donc aucun m\u00e9rite.\n[28] De toute mani\u00e8re, les documents en litige proviennent tous de la saisie de mat\u00e9riel informatique. Lors de l\u2019audition au fond des appels des requ\u00e9rants, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, tel qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9vu au mandat de perquisition, Mme Arbour, en tant qu\u2019enqu\u00eateuse informatique de l\u2019ARC, devait faire l\u2019inventaire de tous les appareils \u00e9lectroniques saisis et d\u00e9crire chaque document ou \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Mme Arbour \u00e9tait la d\u00e9tentrice des documents provenant des appareils \u00e9lectroniques. M. Potvin, \u00e0 titre d\u2019enqu\u00eateur, n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s au contenu informatique saisi. Ce dernier devait faire des demandes pr\u00e9cises de documents \u00e0 Mme Arbour; par exemple, il pouvait demander les documents relatifs \u00e0 M. Mavrovic. Mme Arbour s\u2019assurait que le mandat de perquisition couvrait les documents demand\u00e9s avant d\u2019en remettre des copies \u00e0 M. Potvin. Par cons\u00e9quent, en ce qui a trait aux documents en litige, les photocopies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par Mme Arbour au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les documents sous forme informatique \u00e9taient requis par M. Potvin.\n[29] Les requ\u00e9rants font aussi valoir que l\u2019ARC ne peut conserver une copie des documents saisis une fois que l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, ce serait un moyen pour l\u2019ARC de constituer une banque d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vue d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles proc\u00e9dures civiles, se moquant ainsi des fondements des pouvoirs de perquisition ainsi que des protections \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019article 490 du Code criminel.\n[30] Les requ\u00e9rants ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9battu cette question devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada [2] . Devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les requ\u00e9rants contestaient la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ARC de transmettre \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec (\u00ab ARQ \u00bb) une copie des documents saisis \u00e0 la suite de la perquisition faite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de SPE et \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence personnelle de M. Plante et de Mme Grenier. Devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ces derniers faisaient valoir qu\u2019une fois l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et la d\u00e9cision prise par l\u2019ARC de ne pas porter d\u2019accusation, l\u2019ARC ne pouvait conserver une copie des documents, encore moins en transmettre une \u00e0 l\u2019ARQ. Aux paragraphes 26 et 31 de ses motifs, la juge Gagn\u00e9 rejette l\u2019argument des requ\u00e9rants, \u00e9crivant ce qui suit:\n[26] D\u2019abord, les dispositions du Code criminel sont claires : la saisie \u00e9tant ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un mandat valide, l\u2019ARC dispose d\u2019un droit inconditionnel de tirer des copies des documents saisis (P\u00e8se P\u00eache Inc c R, 2013 NBCA 37 aux paras 12-13; Re Moyer (1994), 95 CCC (3d) 174 aux paras 15, 26 (Div g\u00e9n Ont); Cartier, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 aux paras 20, 25; Bleet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au para 8; Black, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au para 27; Bromley v Canada, 2002 BCSC 149 au para 26).\n[\u2026]\n[31] Il s\u2019en suit que l\u2019ARC pouvait conserver une copie des documents saisis lors de la perquisition dans les bureaux de SPE et qu\u2019elle les d\u00e9tient donc l\u00e9galement.\n[Mes soulignements.]\n[31] Je souscris aux commentaires de la juge Gagn\u00e9. [3]\n(iii) Fusion des pouvoirs entre la v\u00e9rification et l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n[32] Lors de l\u2019audition des appels au fond, M. Potvin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les enqu\u00eateurs lorsqu\u2019ils acceptent un dossier \u00e0 la Division des enqu\u00eates, traitent autant le volet civil que le volet criminel du dossier. Les nouvelles cotisations des requ\u00e9rants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par M. Potvin. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, quand les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies, en octobre 2013, M. Potvin occupait un poste de v\u00e9rificateur. Cependant, M. Potvin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, s\u2019il avait toujours occup\u00e9 le poste d\u2019enqu\u00eateur \u00e0 la Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles, il aurait tout de m\u00eame \u00e9tabli les nouvelles cotisations, car le calcul des amendes au criminel selon l\u2019article 239 de la LIR se fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en fonction de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9lud\u00e9.\n[33] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, cette fusion des r\u00f4les ne cadre pas avec les enseignements de la Cour supr\u00eame dans R. c. Jarvis [4] qui exige qu\u2019une distinction se fasse entre les pouvoirs de l\u2019ARC lors d\u2019une v\u00e9rification et les pouvoirs de l\u2019ARC lors d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle. Ainsi, la preuve saisie \u00e0 la suite du mandat de perquisition ne peut \u00eatre admise en preuve \u00e0 des fins civiles.\n[34] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que font les requ\u00e9rants de la d\u00e9cision Jarvis. Cette d\u00e9cision ne dit pas qu\u2019un fonctionnaire \u00e0 l\u2019ARC ne peut, lors d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle, utiliser les pouvoirs civils pr\u00e9vus aux articles 231.1 et 231.2 de la LIR. Il ressort de la d\u00e9cision Jarvis qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle peut \u00eatre men\u00e9e simultan\u00e9ment avec une v\u00e9rification. Toutefois, d\u00e8s que l\u2019examen ou une question a pour objet pr\u00e9dominant d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale d\u2019un contribuable, l\u2019ARC doit avoir recours au mandat de perquisition pour obtenir les documents n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. D\u00e8s lors, les protections garanties par la Charte s\u2019appliquent. Ainsi, un enqu\u00eateur ne peut utiliser des pouvoirs civils tels que les pouvoirs accord\u00e9s par les paragraphes 231.1(1) et 231.2(1) de la LIR, notamment le pouvoir d\u2019inspection et le pouvoir de faire des demandes p\u00e9remptoires, afin de faire progresser l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. Cela irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du principe qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019auto-incrimination. Cela n\u2019emp\u00eache cependant pas que les documents obtenus en vertu des pouvoirs civils soient utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins de cotisation. \u00c0 ce propos, les juges Iacobucci et Majors affirment ce qui suit aux paragraphes 97 et 98 de leurs motifs :\n97 Le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019ADRC de mener parall\u00e8lement une enqu\u00eate criminelle et une v\u00e9rification administrative. Le fait que l\u2019ADRC enqu\u00eate sur la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale d\u2019un contribuable n\u2019\u00e9carte pas la possibilit\u00e9 que soit men\u00e9e simultan\u00e9ment une enqu\u00eate dont l\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant consiste \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019obligation fiscale du m\u00eame contribuable. Toutefois, si une enqu\u00eate sur la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale est engag\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement, les enqu\u00eateurs peuvent utiliser les renseignements obtenus conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs de v\u00e9rification avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle, mais non les renseignements obtenus conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces pouvoirs apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale. Cela vaut tout autant lorsque les enqu\u00eates touchant la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale et l\u2019obligation fiscale visent la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode d\u2019imposition. Tant que l\u2019enqu\u00eate parall\u00e8le a effectivement pour objet pr\u00e9dominant d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019obligation fiscale du contribuable, les v\u00e9rificateurs peuvent continuer d\u2019avoir recours aux par. 231.1(1) et 231.2(1). Il pourrait bien survenir des circonstances dans lesquelles les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARDC qui \u00e9valuent l\u2019obligation fiscale du contribuable voudront l\u2019informer qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle est \u00e9galement en cours et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas tenu de se soumettre aux pouvoirs de contrainte pr\u00e9vus par les par. 231.1(1) et 231.2(1) pour les besoins de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. Par contre, les autorit\u00e9s pourraient d\u00e9cider d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un mandat de perquisition pr\u00e9vue aux art. 231.3 de la LIR ou 487 du Code criminel pour avoir acc\u00e8s aux documents n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. En d\u2019autres termes, les pouvoirs de contrainte conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les par. 231.1(1) et 231.2(1) ne peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s pour obtenir des d\u00e9clarations verbales ou la production de documents \u00e9crits dans le but de faire progresser une enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n98 En bref, d\u00e8s qu\u2019un examen ou une question a pour objet pr\u00e9dominant d\u2019\u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale du contribuable, il faut utiliser les techniques d\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. \u00c0 titre corollaire, toutes les garanties pr\u00e9vues par la Charte, pertinentes dans le contexte criminel, s\u2019appliquent obligatoirement.\n[35] Qui plus est, dans la d\u00e9cision Bauer [5] de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle qui \u00e9tait en cours. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur responsable de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle a utilis\u00e9 le pouvoir civil pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 231.2(1) de la LIR, soit le recours \u00e0 des demandes p\u00e9remptoires, afin d\u2019obtenir de deux banques des documents relatifs \u00e0 M. Bauer. M. Bauer a fait valoir que la m\u00eame personne ne pouvait \u00eatre responsable de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle et en m\u00eame temps exercer des pouvoirs civils. M. Bauer plaidait que les documents obtenus en vertu des demandes p\u00e9remptoires qui avaient servi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des nouvelles cotisations devaient \u00eatre exclus de la preuve.\n[36] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bauer, le juge Webb de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dit que l\u2019ARC peut continuer \u00e0 utiliser ses pouvoirs civils lors d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle. Selon le juge Webb, si ces pouvoirs peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par deux personnes distinctes \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, il n\u2019y aucun emp\u00eachement \u00e0 ce que ce soit la m\u00eame personne \u00e0 l\u2019ARC qui utilise ces pouvoirs. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est l\u2019usage que l\u2019ARC fait des documents qui sont obtenus. Ainsi, selon la d\u00e9cision Bauer, les documents obtenus par l\u2019enqu\u00eateur en vertu des demandes p\u00e9remptoires pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir les cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Bauer, mais ne pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour faire progresser l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. Le juge Webb pr\u00e9cise que notre Cour ne doit se pr\u00e9occuper que du volet civil et non pas du volet criminel, celui-ci relevant d\u2019une cour provinciale.\n[37] De plus, le juge Webb affirme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bauer qu\u2019il y a un \u00e9l\u00e9ment commun aux nouvelles cotisations et aux infractions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 239 de la LIR : les deux imposent le m\u00eame calcul, soit la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de la dette fiscale.\n[38] Les enseignements du juge Webb dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bauer se trouvent aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 14 de ses motifs :\n[12] Mr. Bauer\u2019s argument is that his case can be distinguished from Romanuk on the basis that while the audit powers remain in effect following the commencement of an investigation, these powers cannot be exercised by the same person who is doing the investigation related to section 239 of the ITA. In my view this distinction is not material. If the powers can be exercised by two different individuals at CRA there does not seem to be any reason why the powers cannot be exercised by the same person at CRA. In each case the question will be whether the documents obtained are to be used for administrative purposes or for the purposes of a prosecution under section 239 of the ITA.\n[13] In my view, even though an investigation had commenced that could lead to charges being laid under section 239 of the ITA, this does not preclude the CRA from using requirements to obtain information or documents that could be used only in relation to the reassessments. Both the reassessments and any charges under section 239 of the ITA ultimately relate to the underlying tax liability of the taxpayer. Therefore, there is a common element in both matters the determination of the unreported income of the taxpayer for a particular year. Common facts will be needed for both the administrative reassessment and the penal charges under section 239 of the ITA.\n[14] While using requirements under section 231.2 of the ITA to obtain information or documents after an investigation has commenced may result in that information or those documents not being admissible in a proceeding related to the prosecution of offences under section 239 of the ITA, it does not preclude that information or documents from being admissible in a Tax Court of Canada proceeding where the issue is the validity of an assessment issued under the ITA. It is the use of the information or documents that is relevant, not who at CRA issued the requirement for information or documents.\n[Mes soulignements.]\n[39] La m\u00eame situation s\u2019est aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Piersanti c La Reine [6] , la personne responsable de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle \u00e0 l\u2019ARC avait utilis\u00e9 le pouvoir civil pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 231.2(1) de la LIR, soit le pouvoir de faire des demandes p\u00e9remptoires, pour obtenir des documents de plusieurs tierces personnes afin de faire progresser l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle. Notre Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les documents obtenus gr\u00e2ce aux demandes p\u00e9remptoires lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle pouvaient servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les nouvelles cotisations. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [7] .\n[40] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces d\u00e9cisions, le fait que M. Potvin ait \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle et qu\u2019il ait \u00e9tabli les nouvelles cotisations dans les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants n\u2019est pas pertinent. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est que l\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas contrevenu aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis. Il est clair que, dans les dossiers en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis. L\u2019ARC, durant l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle, n\u2019a utilis\u00e9 aucun des pouvoirs civils pr\u00e9vus aux articles 231.1(1) et 231.2(1) de la LIR.\n[41] De toute mani\u00e8re, il ressort de la preuve que, lors de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations en octobre 2013, M. Potvin agissait \u00e0 titre de v\u00e9rificateur dans le dossier des requ\u00e9rants depuis la fin d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n(iv) L\u2019ARC ne pouvait utiliser aux fins de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cotisations les documents obtenus lors d\u2019une perquisition, donc ces documents ne pouvaient \u00eatre admissibles en preuve; et\n(v) Lors de la perquisition, l\u2019ARC a saisi des documents de nature personnelle qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec les transactions en litige. De plus, les documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9e veut d\u00e9poser en preuve ne sont pas des registres tel que le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 231 de la LIR. Ainsi, il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des requ\u00e9rants, ce qui contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la Charte.\n[42] Je vais analyser les arguments (iv) et (v) ensemble. Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir que les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreints.\n[43] Les articles 7 et 8 de la Charte \u00e9noncent ce qui suit :\n7. Chacun a droit \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de sa personne; il ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ce droit qu\u2019en conformit\u00e9 avec les principes de justice fondamentale.\n8. Chacun a droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives.\n[44] Dans la d\u00e9cision Jarvis [8] , les juges Iacobucci et Majors indiquent que, pour que l\u2019article 7 de la Charte s\u2019applique, le tribunal doit d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a atteinte r\u00e9elle ou imminente \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne ou \u00e0 une combinaison de ces droits. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un proc\u00e8s portant sur des infractions d\u2019\u00e9vasion fiscale pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 239 de la LIR, le contribuable risque une peine d\u2019emprisonnement. Par cons\u00e9quent, quand on d\u00e9pose dans le cadre de ce proc\u00e8s des renseignements obtenus par la contrainte dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la LIR, l\u2019article 7 de la Charte entre en jeu. Le principe de justice fondamentale applicable est celui interdisant l\u2019auto-incrimination.\n[45] Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous ne sommes pas en mati\u00e8re criminelle mais en mati\u00e8re civile. Les requ\u00e9rants ne risquent pas une peine d\u2019emprisonnement. Il n\u2019y a pas atteinte r\u00e9elle ou imminente \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne des requ\u00e9rants. L\u2019article 7 de la Charte n\u2019entre donc pas en jeu.\n[46] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 de la Charte, dans la d\u00e9cision Jarvis [9] , les juges Iacobucci et Majors affirment :\nPour que l\u2019art. 8 re\u00e7oive application, il doit y avoir eu une fouille, perquisition, ou saisie. Il faut ensuite d\u00e9terminer si la fouille, perquisition ou saisie \u00e9tait abusive. [\u2026] L\u2019art. 8 prot\u00e8ge une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e. [\u2026] Cependant, ce qui est raisonnable est propre au contexte. Dans l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 8, \u00ab il faut appr\u00e9cier si, dans une situation donn\u00e9e, le droit du public de ne pas \u00eatre importun\u00e9 par le gouvernement doit c\u00e9der le pas au droit du gouvernement de s\u2019immiscer dans la vie priv\u00e9e des particuliers afin de r\u00e9aliser ses fins et, notamment, d\u2019assurer l\u2019application de la loi \u00bb [\u2026]\n[47] Les d\u00e9cisions pertinentes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les d\u00e9cisions Klundert c La Reine [10] et Brown c La Reine [11] de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[48] Dans Klundert des renseignements obtenus dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle relativement \u00e0 une \u00e9vasion fiscale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour obtenir une ordonnance conservatoire en vertu de l\u2019article 225.2 de la LIR. La juge Dawson de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans une d\u00e9cision unanime, affirme au paragraphe 10 de ses motifs :\n[\u2026] il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour laquelle des renseignements obtenus dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle, comme ceux recueillis en vertu d\u2019un mandat de perquisition conforme \u00e0 la loi, ne pourraient \u00eatre disponibles \u00e0 des fins connexes en mati\u00e8re civile.\n[49] Dans l\u2019affaire Brown, la ministre avait \u00e9tabli des nouvelles cotisations ajoutant des revenus non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s et imposant des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 163(2) de la LIR. M. Brown faisait valoir que les documents obtenus lors d\u2019une perquisition par la police de London et transmis par cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019ARC ne pouvaient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par l\u2019ARC afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des cotisations civiles et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[50] La juge Dawson dans Brown, une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les documents saisis pouvaient \u00eatre remis \u00e0 l\u2019ARC et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. Selon la juge Dawson, M. Brown n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e relativement aux documents saisis par la police de London. M. Dawson ne pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la police de London prot\u00e8ge la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents saisis. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la juge Dawson \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux paragraphes 18 \u00e0 21 et 23 de ses motifs:\n[18] Selon l\u2019article 8 de la Charte, \u00ab Chacun a droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives \u00bb. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini ce droit comme un droit qui prot\u00e8ge l\u2019attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e (R. c. Cole, 2012 CSC 53 2012 A.C.S. no 53).\n[19] La perquisition et les saisies effectu\u00e9es par la police de London \u00e9taient autoris\u00e9es par mandat. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de ce mandat. Il s\u2019ensuit que la perquisition et les saisies \u00e9taient l\u00e9gales. Se pose alors la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant avait des motifs raisonnables de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la police de London prot\u00e8ge la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents qu\u2019elle avait saisis. La question de l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle attente raisonnable d\u00e9pend de \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des circonstances \u00bb (Cole, paragraphe 39).\n[20] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ni aucune jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la conclusion selon laquelle il avait une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e concernant les documents l\u00e9galement saisis par la police de London.\n[21] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve, le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant devant la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait incompatible avec toute attente subjective en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. En effet, au cours de son interrogatoire principal, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 que les documents saisis par la police auraient d\u00fb lui \u00eatre remis de sorte que l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada aurait pu ensuite les lui demander (transcription du t\u00e9moignage du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012, page 173.\n[\u2026]\n[23] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e relativement aux documents saisis, il s\u2019ensuit que son droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le juge a agi correctement en admettant en preuve les documents en cause.\n[51] Il ressort de ces deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que l\u2019ARC peut utiliser afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des cotisations en mati\u00e8re civile les documents qu\u2019elle a saisis lors d\u2019une perquisition criminelle. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 241(4)a) de la LIR le permet \u00e9galement. En effet, un fonctionnaire de l\u2019ARC peut fournir \u00e0 une autre division de l\u2019ARC des documents qu\u2019il a obtenus s\u2019il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer que ces documents seront n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019application ou \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la LIR. L\u2019alin\u00e9a (4)a) est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n(4) Un fonctionnaire peut :\na) fournir \u00e0 une personne un renseignement confidentiel qu\u2019il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer comme n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019application ou \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la pr\u00e9sente loi, du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage ou de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, mais uniquement \u00e0 cette fin.\n[52] Cela \u00e9tant dit, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Jarvis, devront \u00eatre suivis quand une v\u00e9rification devient une enqu\u00eate criminelle. L\u2019article 8 de la Charte s\u2019appliquera aussi si le contribuable prouve qu\u2019il a une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents saisis. La question de l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle attente d\u00e9pendra de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances et du contexte.\n[53] Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir qu\u2019ils avaient une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents saisis qui sont en litige. Ils soutiennent que les documents doivent rester confidentiels car aucune accusation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre eux.\n[54] Les requ\u00e9rants avaient invoqu\u00e9 le m\u00eame argument dans leurs dossiers devant la juge Gagn\u00e9 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. La juge Gagn\u00e9 \u00e9crit ce qui suit au paragraphe 29 de ses motifs :\n29 Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019en pensent les demandeurs, le principe ainsi d\u00e9gag\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Piersanti n\u2019est pas fonction du fait que dans cette affaire, le demandeur avait plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 35 chefs d\u2019accusation. Le principe voulant que des informations recueillies dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate criminelle puissent servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations, sans pour autant contrevenir \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tablie dans Jarvis, s\u2019applique, \u00e0 mon humble avis, peu importe l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle.\n[55] Je souscris aux commentaires de la juge Gagn\u00e9. De plus, dans l\u2019affaire Brown, M. Brown n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable puisque les mises en accusation avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate criminelle n\u2019est pas pertinente.\n[56] Les requ\u00e9rants plaident aussi que le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019un contribuable n\u2019est restreint qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents et registres qu\u2019ils doivent tenir selon le paragraphe 230(1) de la LIR. Cependant, les requ\u00e9rants font valoir que les documents saisis autres que ceux pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 230(1) - en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce des courriels r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par des tierces personnes - doivent conserver leur caract\u00e8re confidentiel.\n[57] Les requ\u00e9rants font \u00e9galement valoir que, lors de la perquisition informatique, la Division des enqu\u00eates criminelles a mis la main sur plusieurs nouveaux documents ainsi qu\u2019une grande quantit\u00e9 de donn\u00e9es informatiques. De plus, le serveur actif qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi permettait \u00e0 l\u2019ARC d\u2019obtenir une copie des sauvegardes des donn\u00e9es dans les ordinateurs des utilisateurs du r\u00e9seau de SPE, lesquelles donn\u00e9es comprenaient notamment le contenu de la bo\u00eete de courriels de M. Mavrovic et de ses dossiers personnels. Les requ\u00e9rants font valoir aussi que des documents personnels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis dans la chambre \u00e0 coucher de M. Plante et de Mme Grenier et que ces documents n\u2019avaient aucun lien avec les transactions fiscales.\n[58] De plus, les requ\u00e9rants font valoir qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Brown, la perquisition criminelle a permis \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de mettre la main sur des documents qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas obtenus lors de la v\u00e9rification. Les requ\u00e9rants font donc valoir qu\u2019ils avaient une attente en mati\u00e8re de droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et que les documents saisis doivent \u00eatre exclus de la preuve selon le paragraphe 24(2) de la Charte.\n[59] D\u2019abord, le mandat de perquisition autorisait l\u2019ARC \u00e0 perquisitionner \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de M. Plante et de sa conjointe Mme Grenier ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de SPE, de SPE Affacturage et de SPEQ SPE Technologies. De plus, le mandat de perquisition autorisait la saisie de tous les appareils informatiques [12] . Cela ne peut \u00eatre remis en question par les requ\u00e9rants devant notre Cour. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si les saisies \u00e9taient abusives. Si les requ\u00e9rants \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que les saisies \u00e9taient abusives, ils devaient s\u2019adresser \u00e0 une cour provinciale. La comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les cotisations sont valides.\n[60] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je dois d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019article 8 de la Charte a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint. Je dois donc d\u00e9cider si les requ\u00e9rants avaient une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9e veut d\u00e9poser en preuve et non pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis lors des perquisitions. La grande majorit\u00e9 des documents en litige sont des courriels de M. Mavrovic [13] . Ce dernier jouait un r\u00f4le important dans les transactions fiscales en litige.\n[61] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c McKinlay [14] , la juge Wilson de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada indique que le droit du contribuable \u00e0 la protection de sa vie priv\u00e9e est relativement faible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de documents demand\u00e9s au moyen de demandes p\u00e9remptoires; il suffit que les documents soient utiles au d\u00e9p\u00f4t des d\u00e9clarations d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, soit l\u2019assujettissement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[62] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis [15] , la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada r\u00e9it\u00e8re que l\u2019attente en mati\u00e8re de respect de la vie priv\u00e9e dans le contexte de la LIR est tr\u00e8s restreinte:\n95 En ce qui concerne l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 8 de la Charte, l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinlay Transport, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e9tablit clairement que le droit au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e du contribuable est tr\u00e8s restreint en ce qui concerne les documents et registres qu\u2019il doit tenir conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LIR et produire au cours d\u2019une v\u00e9rification. [\u2026] Ainsi, aucun principe d\u2019immunit\u00e9 contre l\u2019utilisation n\u2019emp\u00eache les enqu\u00eateurs, dans l\u2019exercice de leur fonction d\u2019enqu\u00eate, d\u2019utiliser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus dans l\u2019exercice r\u00e9gulier de la fonction de v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ADR [\u2026]\n[Mes soulignements.]\n[63] Bien que les d\u00e9cisions McKinlay et Jarvis s\u2019appliquent dans le contexte civil, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Brown, la juge Dawson, s\u2019appuyant sur les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Jarvis, a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les documents saisis lors d\u2019une perquisition criminelle pouvaient \u00eatre admis en preuve dans un appel d\u2019une cotisation. Quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents en mati\u00e8re fiscale, elle \u00e9crit au paragraphe 22 de ses motifs :\nPar ailleurs, la jurisprudence ne permet pas de conclure, de fa\u00e7on objective, \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une attente importante en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Comme le juge l\u2019a soulign\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame a observ\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis (au paragraphe 95), que \u00ab le droit au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e du contribuable est tr\u00e8s restreint en ce qui concerne les documents et registres qu\u2019il doit tenir conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LIR, et produire au cours d\u2019une v\u00e9rification \u00bb.\n[64] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire, comme les requ\u00e9rants, que l\u2019attente raisonnable d\u2019un contribuable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9 n\u2019est restreinte qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des livres et registres vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 230(1) de la LIR. Tel que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, l\u2019arr\u00eat Jarvis pr\u00e9cise que le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e des contribuables sera tr\u00e8s restreint non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des livres et registres qu\u2019un contribuable doit tenir selon le paragraphe 230(1), mais \u00e9galement, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents que le contribuable doit produire lors d\u2019une v\u00e9rification. En outre, l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinlay sp\u00e9cifie que, dans le contexte de demandes p\u00e9remptoires, le droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9 des contribuables est faible quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[65] De plus, les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli lors de l\u2019audition des appels au fond ou durant l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate dont il est ici question, que l\u2019ARC n\u2019aurait pas pu obtenir, par le biais de demandes p\u00e9remptoires, les documents en litige [16] dans le cadre d\u2019une v\u00e9rification.\n[66] De toute mani\u00e8re, les documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9sire d\u00e9poser en preuve portent sur les transactions fiscales en litige des requ\u00e9rants. Les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur position aucune jurisprudence qui \u00e9tablit qu\u2019ils avaient une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Le fait que les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crits par une tierce personne, M. Mavrovic n\u2019est pas un motif suffisant. [17] Je vois mal comment les requ\u00e9rants pouvaient avoir une attente raisonnable en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Les courriels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis sur le serveur actif de SPE. Les courriels en question concernent les transactions fiscales en litige effectu\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants. Ce ne sont pas des courriels personnels de M. Mavrovic.\n[67] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que les droits garantis par l\u2019article 8 de la Charte n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s. Les documents en litige sont donc admissibles en preuve dans les appels au fond. Les objections faites par les requ\u00e9rants relativement au d\u00e9p\u00f4t en preuve de ces documents sont rejet\u00e9es.\n[68] Les frais suivront l\u2019issue de la cause.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 27e jour d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2019.\n\u00ab Johanne D\u2019Auray \u00bb\nJuge D\u2019Auray\nANNEXE 1\nLes documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sous la cote I\u20111, onglets 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74 75 \u00e0 78, 80 \u00e0 91, 94, 97, 99, 102, 104, 105 \u00e0 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120 et 122 ainsi que les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sous la cote I\u20116, onglet 24.\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2019 CCI 174\nNos DES DOSSIERS DE LA COUR :\n2015-1917(IT)G et 2015-1921(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nSPE VALEUR ASSURABLE INC.\nc SA MAJEST\u00c9 LA REINE\nROBERT PLANTE c SA MAJEST\u00c9 LA REINE\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nQu\u00e9bec (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 11 f\u00e9vrier 2019\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE PAR :\nL\u2019honorable juge Johanne D\u2019Auray\nDATE DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE :\nLe 27 ao\u00fbt 2019\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats des requ\u00e9rants :\nMe Francis Fortin\nMe Gabriel Dumais\nAvocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\nMe Michel Lamarre\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER :\nPour les requ\u00e9rants :\nNom :\nMe Francis Fortin\nMe Gabriel Dumais\nCabinet :\nTremblay Bois Mignault Lemay, s.e.n.c.r.l.\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\nNathalie G.

L\u2019ARC affirme que la v\u00e9rification a pris fin avec l\u2019envoi d\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 et 2016, mais que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a signifi\u00e9 aucun avis d\u2019opposition dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour contester ces nouvelles cotisations et qu\u2019il n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du ministre du Revenu national, en temps opportun, aucune demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[2] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7u d\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation avant de retenir les services de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Fraser Simpson, \u00e0 la fin de 2019 ou au d\u00e9but de 2020. Le 9 juin 2022, M. Simpson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande aupr\u00e8s de la Cour en vue d\u2019obtenir une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour s\u2019opposer \u00e0 ces nouvelles cotisations[1].\n[3] Le requ\u00e9rant souhaite contester les nouvelles cotisations et, \u00e0 cette fin, demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019accueillir sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour s\u2019opposer aux nouvelles cotisations.\nPosition du requ\u00e9rant\n[4] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u [les] avis de nouvell[e] cotisatio[n] \u00bb[2].\nPreuve du requ\u00e9rant\n[5] La Cour a entendu virtuellement la preuve du requ\u00e9rant et a re\u00e7u la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous forme d\u2019affidavits d\u2019agents de l\u2019ARC.\n[6] En entendant la preuve du requ\u00e9rant, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par l\u2019absence de documents et l\u2019impr\u00e9cision de ses souvenirs. Avant l\u2019audience, la Cour l\u2019a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner virtuellement de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Windsor (Ontario). On aurait pu penser que le requ\u00e9rant aurait tous les documents pertinents devant lui, mais il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de produire un seul document en preuve.\n[7] Par exemple, le requ\u00e9rant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en disant que la correspondance de l\u2019ARC \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab au mieux sporadique \u00bb, mais n\u2019a produit aucune copie ou indication de cette correspondance. C\u2019est un point important, puisque le requ\u00e9rant a fond\u00e9 sa cause sur le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun avis de nouvelle cotisation. A-t-il re\u00e7u du courrier de l\u2019ARC? Dans l\u2019affirmative, quand? A-t-il re\u00e7u du courrier d\u2019autres exp\u00e9diteurs? Cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tant sans fondement factuel, ce qui est \u00e9trange, d\u2019autant plus que le requ\u00e9rant est lui-m\u00eame un facteur.\n[8] La preuve par affidavit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a permis de rem\u00e9dier aux nombreuses lacunes dans les vagues souvenirs du requ\u00e9rant en ce qui concerne les dates et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve cr\u00e9dible pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les affidavits de l\u2019ARC.\nDispositions l\u00e9gislatives\n[9] J\u2019examinerai les nouvelles cotisations en deux groupes. Le premier groupe comprend les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012 et 2013. Le deuxi\u00e8me groupe comprend les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015 et 2016. Toutefois, avant de les examiner, j\u2019exposerai les dispositions applicables de la Loi et je soulignerais que le mot \u00ab cotisation \u00bb comprend une \u00ab nouvelle cotisation \u00bb (Loi, par. 248(1)) :\nOpposition \u00e0 la cotisation\n165(1) Le contribuable qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 une cotisation pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente partie peut signifier au ministre, par \u00e9crit, un avis d\u2019opposition exposant les motifs de son opposition et tous les faits pertinents, dans les d\u00e9lais suivants :\na) s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une cotisation, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, relative \u00e0 un contribuable qui est un particulier [\u2026] au plus tard au dernier en date des jours suivants :\n(i) le jour qui tombe un an apr\u00e8s la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e,\n(ii) le quatre-vingt-dixi\u00e8me jour suivant la date d\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis de cotisation; [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nProrogation du d\u00e9lai par le ministre\n166.1(1) Le contribuable qui n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 une cotisation en application de l\u2019article 165 [\u2026] dans le d\u00e9lai imparti peut demander au ministre de proroger le d\u00e9lai pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026].\n[\u2026]\nConditions d\u2019acceptation de la demande\n166.1(7) Il n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) la demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition [\u2026];\nb) le contribuable d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\n(i) dans le d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026], il n\u2019a pu ni agir ni charger quelqu\u2019un d\u2019agir en son nom, ou il avait v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019intention de faire opposition \u00e0 la cotisation [\u2026],\n(ii) compte tenu des raisons indiqu\u00e9es dans la demande et des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 la demande,\n(iii) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient.\nProrogation du d\u00e9lai par la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t\n166.2(1) Le contribuable qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en application de l\u2019article 166.1 peut demander \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019y faire droit apr\u00e8s :\na) le rejet de la demande par le ministre;\nb) l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours suivant la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande, si le ministre n\u2019a pas avis\u00e9 le contribuable de sa d\u00e9cision.\nToutefois, une telle demande ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours suivant la date de la mise \u00e0 la poste de l\u2019avis de la d\u00e9cision au contribuable.\n[\u2026]\nAcceptation de la demande\n166.2(5) Il n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si les conditions suivantes sont r\u00e9unies :\na) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application du paragraphe 166.1(1) dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition [\u2026];\nb) le contribuable d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\n(i) dans le d\u00e9lai par ailleurs imparti pour signifier l\u2019avis [\u2026], il n\u2019a pu ni agir ni charger quelqu\u2019un d\u2019agir en son nom, ou il avait v\u00e9ritablement l\u2019intention de faire opposition \u00e0 la cotisation [\u2026],\n(ii) compte tenu des raisons indiqu\u00e9es dans la demande et des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste et \u00e9quitable de faire droit \u00e0 la demande,\n(iii) la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettaient.\nNouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du requ\u00e9rant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012 et 2013\n[10] L\u2019ARC affirme avoir envoy\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant les avis de nouvelle cotisation suivants par la poste \u00e0 la date suivante :\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2011 Le 4 juillet 2016\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2012 Le 4 juillet 2016\nAvis de nouvelle cotisation pour 2013 Le 4 juillet 2016\n[11] Le requ\u00e9rant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun de ces avis de nouvelle cotisation.

Une semaine apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition, l\u2019ARC a \u00e9crit au requ\u00e9rant, l\u2019informant que son avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on valable, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours. Dans la lettre, l\u2019ARC ajoute que le requ\u00e9rant avait un an \u00e0 compter de l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour demander au ministre une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition[3].\n[14] Le requ\u00e9rant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai, mais il a attendu jusqu\u2019en mai 2018 pour le faire. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour pr\u00e9senter au ministre une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 166.1(7)a) de la Loi.

Parce que le requ\u00e9rant a autoris\u00e9 l\u2019ARC \u00e0 le faire[5]. Le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019est inscrit \u00e0 ce que l\u2019ARC appelle \u00ab Mon Dossier \u00bb, un compte \u00e9lectronique s\u00e9curis\u00e9 \u00e0 partir duquel les contribuables peuvent acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la correspondance qui leur est envoy\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC, y compris, entre autres, aux avis de cotisation et de nouvelle cotisation.\n[18] Le probl\u00e8me en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre de demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour signifier un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses nouvelles cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2015 et 2016 en vertu de l\u2019article 166.1 de la Loi. Une telle demande doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant qu\u2019un requ\u00e9rant puisse d\u00e9poser une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai \u00e0 la Cour.

Si les parties souhaitent faire des observations additionnelles quant aux questions en litige dans ces appels, elles doivent communiquer avec le coordonnateur des audiences au plus tard le 15 juin 2023 pour en informer la Cour et, dans un tel cas :\ni)Les parties doivent d\u00e9poser leurs observations \u00e9crites au plus tard le 29 septembre 2023; et\nii)Les observations orales des parties seront entendues au cours d\u2019une audience d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019au plus deux (2) jours cons\u00e9cutifs qui devra se tenir au cours des mois d\u2019octobre 2023 ou de novembre 2023; les parties doivent aviser la Cour de leur disponibilit\u00e9 commune au plus tard le 15 juin 2023 pour la tenue d\u2019une telle audience.\nLa Cour se r\u00e9serve le droit de rappeler tout t\u00e9moin ayant t\u00e9moigner au cours de l\u2019audience tenue en octobre et novembre 2017.\nIII. LES APPELS LOG\u00c9S \u00c0 LA COUR En ce qui concerne SPE :\n[6] L\u2019appel concerne les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2005 \u00e0 2009. En vertu des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, des d\u00e9ductions totalisant 1 089 129$ r\u00e9clam\u00e9es dans le calcul du revenu de SPE \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9penses pour fins d\u2019entreprise ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a) de la Loi. Le ministre pr\u00e9tend que SPE a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de fausses d\u00e9penses \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance relativement \u00e0 six pr\u00e9tendues soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaines. De plus, des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es pour toutes les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition.\n[7] De plus, le ministre pr\u00e9tend que SPE a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par inattention, n\u00e9gligence ou omission volontaire ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant ses d\u00e9clarations de revenu ou en fournissant des renseignements pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019impositions 2005 \u00e0 2009, et qu\u2019elle a sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus produites pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2005 \u00e0 2009.\n[8] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, SPE pr\u00e9tend que ces frais de commercialisation, de commissions et de mise en march\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es afin de mettre en march\u00e9 le produit de SPE, soit le logiciel de gestion d\u2019actifs, dans un authentique contexte d\u2019exploitation d\u2019entreprise. \u00c9galement, rien ne justifie l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, ni l\u2019imposition des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi, puisque SPE \u00e9tait de bonne foi.\nEn ce qui concerne M. Plante: [9] L\u2019appel concerne les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2003 \u00e0 2008. En vertu des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, des montants totalisant 1 526 144$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante \u00e0 titre de paiements indirects en vertu du paragraphe 56(2) de la Loi pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2004 \u00e0 2008, et des d\u00e9penses totalisant 13 128$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2003. Les montants ainsi ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante repr\u00e9sentent les d\u00e9penses de commercialisation dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 SPE. De plus, des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la Loi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es pour toutes les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition.\n[10] Le ministre pr\u00e9tend que, suivant les instructions de M. Plante, SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les sommes mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus de son compte bancaire aux comptes bancaires de pr\u00e9tendues soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines de mise en march\u00e9 dans le but pour M. Plante de s\u2019approprier ces fonds pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel et d\u2019avantager certaines connaissances, et que si le paiement de ces montants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits directement par SPE \u00e0 M. Plante, ce dernier aurait d\u00fb inclure ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu du paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi.\n[11] De plus, le ministre pr\u00e9tend que M. Plante a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par inattention, n\u00e9gligence ou omission volontaire ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant ses d\u00e9clarations de revenu ou en fournissant des renseignements pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019impositions 2003 \u00e0 2008, et qu\u2019il a sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus produites pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2003 \u00e0 2008.\n[12] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. Plante pr\u00e9tend que les nouvelles cotisations doivent \u00eatre annul\u00e9es, ayant toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi, et que les montants ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 son revenu ne doivent pas \u00eatre inclus \u00e0 son revenu puisqu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent des d\u00e9penses justifi\u00e9es par les engagements de SPE envers divers agents commerciaux am\u00e9ricains, dans un authentique contexte d\u2019exploitation d\u2019entreprise, et que les fonds re\u00e7us sont des pr\u00eats constat\u00e9s par billets \u00e0 ordre.\nIV. CHRONOLOGIE [13] Les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants font partie d\u2019un groupe de dix-sept (17) dossiers, dont la majorit\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendus en attente d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants.\n[14] La chronologie se d\u00e9taille ainsi :\n29 avril 2015 : d\u00e9p\u00f4t des avis d\u2019appel par les requ\u00e9rants;\n22 juillet 2016 : demandes communes des parties de fixer les appels pour audition;\n12 d\u00e9cembre 2016 : ordonnance de la Cour fixant l\u2019audition de ces appels au lundi 30 octobre 2017 pour une dur\u00e9e de 5 jours;\n26 octobre 2017 : lettre des requ\u00e9rants demandant \u00e0 la Cour la permission de tenir un d\u00e9bat pr\u00e9liminaire sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve de certains documents lors de l\u2019audition qui doit d\u00e9buter le 30 octobre 2017;\n30 et 31 octobre 2017 et les 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 et 9 novembre 2017 (8 jours): audition des appels;\n9 novembre 2017 : mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des dossiers par la juge pr\u00e9sidente au proc\u00e8s (la \u00ab juge pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb), sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour exclusion de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) au cours d\u2019une perquisition et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants, soit les requ\u00e9rants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce;\n19 mars 2018 : la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par l\u2019ARC dans le cadre d\u2019une perquisition sur la base des articles 8 et 24(2) de la Charte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour par les requ\u00e9rants (la \u00ab requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve \u00bb);\n11 f\u00e9vrier 2019 : la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve est entendue par la juge pr\u00e9sidente;\n27 ao\u00fbt 2019 : la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve est rejet\u00e9e par la juge pr\u00e9sidente selon les motifs publi\u00e9s sous 2019 CCI 174;\n11 octobre 2019 : les requ\u00e9rants portent en appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour rejetant la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve;\n22 octobre 2019 : le greffe de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale notifie la Greffi\u00e8re de cette Cour qu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 log\u00e9e dans les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants;\n20 janvier 2020 : la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rend une ordonnance suspendant l\u2019instance devant celle-ci sans rejeter l\u2019appel, et concluent que les requ\u00e9rants pourront en appeler de la d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le cadre de l\u2019appel, s\u2019il en est, de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond (dossier no A-391-19);\n23 et 26 juillet 2021 : l\u2019intim\u00e9 communique avec la Cour afin de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir du statut de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond des appels entendus par la Cour en octobre et novembre 2017;\n27 juillet 2021 : le plumitif de la Cour enregistre l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dat\u00e9e du 20 janvier 2020;\n5 ao\u00fbt 2021 : la juge pr\u00e9sidente tient une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience par laquelle elle avise les parties que l\u2019ordonnance du 20 janvier 2020 de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 son attention et enregistr\u00e9e au plumitif de la Cour que le 27 juillet 2021, et qu\u2019elle rendra sa d\u00e9cision sur le fond avant la fin du mois de septembre 2021;\n30 mars 2022 : dans le cadre d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance tenue par la Cour devant le juge Boyle, au nom du juge en chef, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es du d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite de la juge pr\u00e9sidente pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 en date du 4 avril 2022, sans qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision sur le fond n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans leurs dossiers. La Cour propose deux options aux parties : soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s devant un juge \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef, ou soit qu\u2019un juge nomm\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers (transcriptions et documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve lors de l\u2019audition des appels) et selon des modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par le nouveau juge. Si les parties d\u00e9cident qu\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s est requis, ce proc\u00e8s sera fix\u00e9 devant un nouveau juge. Si les parties consentent \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un juge rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, la Cour indique que ce juge communiquera avec les parties pour leur faire part de ce qu\u2019il aura besoin pour rendre jugement, que ce soit en terme d\u2019observations additionnelles ou de toute autre modalit\u00e9. Les parties doivent faire part de leurs choix s\u2019il y a entente entre eux au plus tard le 15 avril 2022, ou bien, en cas de m\u00e9sentente entre eux, les parties doivent soumettre des observations \u00e9crites au juge en chef au plus tard le 29 avril 2022;\n29 avril 2022 : les requ\u00e9rants indiquent au juge en chef que leur choix, pris de commun accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, est de proc\u00e9der selon les modalit\u00e9s suivantes :\n\u00c0 cet effet, nous proposons que l\u2019ensemble de la preuve testimoniale et documentaire administr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du premier proc\u00e8s le soit de pareille mani\u00e8re aux fins de la nouvelle audition (en tenant compte des objections formul\u00e9es par les parties). Ce deuxi\u00e8me proc\u00e8s serait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 un exercice de r\u00e9vision de la preuve par les parties, de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux plaidoiries qui seraient reprises dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Cet exercice serait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e r\u00e9duite et permettrait entre autres aux parties de renseigner la Cour sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u2019importance et r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui pourraient \u00eatre amen\u00e9es par le nouveau juge attitr\u00e9 au dossier.\n31 mai 2022 : une autre conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance est tenue par la Cour devant le juge Boyle, au nom du juge en chef : la Cour prend acte du choix des parties comme d\u00e9crit dans leur lettre du 29 avril 2022, soit qu\u2019une audience soit fix\u00e9e pour permettre aux parties de r\u00e9viser la preuve et de pr\u00e9senter leurs soumissions. Ainsi, l\u2019audience pourra \u00eatre tenue \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec au cours des mois de juin 2023, ou par la suite, selon la dur\u00e9e voulue par les parties (3 jours). Les parties indiquent qu\u2019ils pourraient possiblement se lib\u00e9rer \u00e9galement au cours de l\u2019hiver 2023, pour une audition \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Les parties sont avis\u00e9es que la prochaine \u00e9tape sera probablement la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour rendre jugement dans ces dossiers;\n21 octobre 2022 : les requ\u00e9rants indiquent qu\u2019ils ne sont pas disponibles aux dates offertes par la Cour pour l\u2019audition de ces dossiers et demandent de fixer une conf\u00e9rence de gestion;\n10 novembre 2022 : ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par le juge en chef pour rendre jugement dans ces dossiers, je tiens une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience. Les requ\u00e9rants avisent alors la Cour qu\u2019ils veulent pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 la tenue de l\u2019audience pour faire valoir que les appels doivent \u00eatre admis et les nouvelles cotisations annul\u00e9es dans les deux dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, pour les motifs de violation aux principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Aucune date d\u2019audience n\u2019est alors fix\u00e9e, puisque les requ\u00e9rants rejettent leur propre proposition d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du 29 avril 2022;\n9 janvier 2023 : la Cour tient une nouvelle conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance devant le juge Boyle, au nom du juge en chef. La Cour rappelle aux parties les deux options offertes aux parties pour la suite des dossiers : soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, ou soit qu\u2019un juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es par ce juge. Les requ\u00e9rants r\u00e9it\u00e8rent la permission de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. La Cour donne permission aux requ\u00e9rants de d\u00e9poser la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire au plus tard le 24 janvier 2023. Aucune date d\u2019audition n\u2019est alors fix\u00e9e;\n24 janvier 2023 : je tiens une nouvelle conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019audience, au cours de laquelle je rappelle aux parties que les options offertes par la Cour \u00e9taient soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s devant un nouveau juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef, ou soit qu\u2019un nouveau juge d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es par ce juge, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Les requ\u00e9rants all\u00e8guent qu\u2019ils refusent de proc\u00e9der selon l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des options offertes par la Cour de m\u00eame que de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite dans la lettre du 29 avril 2022, compte tenu des d\u00e9lais \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis cette date, et indiquent qu\u2019ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 d\u00e9poser la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mention en novembre dernier.\nV. TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES Les requ\u00e9rants :\n[15] Les requ\u00e9rants ne contestent pas le pouvoir du juge en chef de la Cour de r\u00e9assigner les dossiers \u00e0 un autre juge de la Cour. Toutefois, les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que le processus mis en place par la Cour n\u2019est pas \u00e9quitable pour les requ\u00e9rants, et r\u00e9sulte en un abus de proc\u00e9dure, telle que cette doctrine est connue et appliqu\u00e9e dans le cadre du droit administratif.\n[16] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, les deux options propos\u00e9es par la Cour suite au d\u00e9part de la juge pr\u00e9sidente, soit la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ou soit un jugement rendu sur la base des dossiers (selon des modalit\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par un nouveau juge), r\u00e9sultent en un abus de proc\u00e9dure, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale pour les requ\u00e9rants dans le cadre de l\u2019une et l\u2019autre des options offertes aux parties. De plus, m\u00eame si la Cour conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, il y aurait abus de proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9sultant des d\u00e9lais judiciaires dans ces dossiers dont ils ne sont pas responsables.\n[17] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif, \u00e9tant une notion tr\u00e8s flexible, doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9e au d\u00e9cideur administratif et doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on large. L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est applicable dans divers contextes et particuli\u00e8rement dans ces dossiers.\n[18] Les requ\u00e9rants conviennent que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est inusit\u00e9e et que les questions soulev\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par la Cour. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, la Cour a la comp\u00e9tence pour octroyer les conclusions recherch\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants, soit d\u2019admettre les appels dans ces dossiers et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour les motifs d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour. Selon les requ\u00e9rant, les cas de M. Plante et de SPE sont des cas hors normes n\u00e9cessitant une intervention hors norme de la Cour.\n[19] Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019option de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s serait en principe acceptable pour les requ\u00e9rants, mais ils ne peuvent y acquiescer. En effet, la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ternirait l\u2019image de la justice puisqu\u2019il ne pourrait y avoir de garantie au niveau de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale du nouveau proc\u00e8s, r\u00e9sultant en un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis 2017, la difficult\u00e9 de retrouver certains t\u00e9moins, la m\u00e9moire d\u00e9faillante des t\u00e9moins ainsi que les difficult\u00e9s pour M. Plante et SPE d\u2019obtenir des services juridiques vu l\u2019estim\u00e9 des honoraires professionnelles pour se faire ainsi repr\u00e9senter dans le cadre d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 38-39).\n[20] Alternativement, les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s porterait atteinte aux droits de M. Plante garantis par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 psychologique de M. Plante seraient compromises par la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 40).\n[21] La seconde option offerte par la Cour, soit qu\u2019un juge rende jugement sur la base des dossiers, n\u2019est \u00e9galement pas acceptable pour les requ\u00e9rants. En effet, de la r\u00e8gle voulant que les parties ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendues d\u00e9coule le principe que ce soit le juge ayant pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s qui rende jugement. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un autre juge rend jugement, cette r\u00e8gle n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e et cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale n\u2019est pas maintenue. Les requ\u00e9rants conviennent toutefois que la disponibilit\u00e9 des enregistrements sonores de l\u2019audience vient r\u00e9duire la port\u00e9e de cet argument, mais ne l\u2019\u00e9limine pas compl\u00e8tement. \u00c9galement, les dossiers sont tr\u00e8s volumineux. Plusieurs documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en preuve et certains documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits sur support informatique.\n[22] De plus, le juge qui doit rendre jugement sur dossier est li\u00e9 par toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par la juge pr\u00e9sidente au cours du proc\u00e8s. Selon les requ\u00e9rants, en l\u2019absence du consentement des parties, la Cour ne peut ordonner pareil mode de fonctionnement.\n[23] Pour ces raisons, les requ\u00e9rants ne peuvent acquiescer \u00e0 la demande de la Cour, et demandent d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 :\n[24] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour \u00e9tant un tribunal judiciaire, la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif ne peut s\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9cisions ou ordonnances de la Cour relatives \u00e0 sa propre proc\u00e9dure. \u00c9galement, la Cour n\u2019a vraisemblablement pas comp\u00e9tence pour admettre les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, telle que cette doctrine est connue en droit administratif. Pour ces raisons, la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[25] De plus, m\u00eame si la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de droit administratif \u00e9tait applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste, bien que le d\u00e9lai de 26 mois ou de 8 mois depuis la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 par la juge pr\u00e9sidente est consid\u00e9rable, ce d\u00e9lai n\u2019est pas excessif : le point de d\u00e9part du d\u00e9lai est soit le 20 janvier 2020 (ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve), ou soit le 27 juillet 2021 (inscription au plumitif de la Cour de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) et se termine au mois de mars 2022, au moment o\u00f9 la Cour a avis\u00e9 les parties du d\u00e9part de la juge pr\u00e9sidente. Ainsi, il ne serait pas justifi\u00e9 d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour ce motif. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice commande qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue par la Cour dans un proc\u00e8s qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision sur le fond qui constituerait un d\u00e9ni de justice, et non le contraire.\n[26] En vertu de l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, un juge de la Cour d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour continuer les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants peut d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en s\u2019assurant que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, qui pourrait \u00eatre soit de rendre jugement sur la base des dossiers ou encore, soit d\u2019ordonner la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame sans l\u2019accord des parties (D\u2019Amico v. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785 [D\u2019Amico], par. 44).\n[27] Finalement, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019argument des requ\u00e9rants concernant l\u2019article 7 de la Charte ne peut \u00eatre retenu, puisque les ordonnances judiciaires ne sont pas assujetties \u00e0 la Charte (art. 32 de la Charte; voir aussi Syndicat des d\u00e9taillants, grossistes et magasins \u00e0 rayons, section locale 580 [SDGMR] c. Dolphin Delivery Ltd [1986] 2 R.C.S. 573, par. 34 et 36 et McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, par. 157 et 158). \u00c9galement, il est bien \u00e9tabli que les droits \u00e9conomiques ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte, ce qui inclus les cotisations d\u2019imp\u00f4t (Gratl c. La Reine, 2012 CAF 88, par. 8). Il s\u2019ensuit donc que le d\u00e9lai pour obtenir une d\u00e9cision touchant \u00e0 un droit non vis\u00e9 par la Charte ne peut \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par celle-ci.\n[28] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les facteurs suivants militent en faveur de l\u2019option de rendre jugement sur dossiers : la preuve est close, les plaidoiries sont compl\u00e9t\u00e9es, les contre-interrogatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la satisfaction des parties, et la Cour a acc\u00e8s non seulement aux transcriptions, mais \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement sonore de l\u2019audience. De plus, la d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante fait \u00e9tat de r\u00e9elles difficult\u00e9s si la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait ordonn\u00e9e.\nVI. DISCUSSION LA REQU\u00caTE\n[29] Pour les motifs suivants, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\n[30] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour admettre les appels et annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus par la Cour elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures.\n[31] \u00c9galement, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif ne peut s\u2019appliquer aux d\u00e9cisions ou ordonnances de la Cour relatives \u00e0 sa propre proc\u00e9dure, la Cour \u00e9tant un tribunal judiciaire. Toutefois, m\u00eame si la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif \u00e9tait applicable, la Cour conclut que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des options offertes aux parties pour continuer les dossiers ne portent pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c9galement, la Cour conclut que le d\u00e9lai judiciaire dans ces dossiers n\u2019est pas excessif.\nComp\u00e9tence de la Cour et doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire :\n[32] Pour les motifs suivants, autant les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s l\u00e9gislativement que les pouvoirs s\u2019inf\u00e9rant n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice (par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire) ne permettent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019admettre les appels et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations pour le motif d\u2019abus par la Cour elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures.\n[33] Les requ\u00e9rants n\u2019ont cit\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9cision jurisprudentielle sur l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire qui donnerait par ailleurs pouvoir inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la Cour de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un abus par elle-m\u00eame de ses propres proc\u00e9dures en admettant les appels et annulant les cotisations. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les deux parties ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pu retracer aucune d\u00e9cision traitant de cette question. La raison en est bien simple, puisque la Cour n\u2019a tout simplement pas ce pouvoir.\n[34] La comp\u00e9tence de la Cour est fix\u00e9e par la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (LRC (1985), ch. T-2, telle que modifi\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 12) et se limite :\n\u00ab .. \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 et le bienfond\u00e9 de la cotisation en fonction des dispositions applicables de la Loi \u2026 et des faits donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019obligation du contribuable pr\u00e9vue par la loi (Ereiser c. Canada, 2013 CAF 20, par. 31).\n[35] L\u2019article 171 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit les pouvoirs de la Cour dans le cadre d\u2019un appel d\u2019une cotisation sous la Loi :\n\u00ab La Cour peut statuer sur un appel en le rejetant ou en l\u2019admettant et en annulant la cotisation, ou en modifiant la cotisation ou en d\u00e9f\u00e9rant la cotisation au ministre pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation \u00bb.\n[36] Il est aussi bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour annuler une cotisation sur la base d\u2019un abus de pouvoir ou d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation (Canada (Revenu national) c. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 CAF 250, par. 83).\n[37] Dans l\u2019affaire Main Rehabilitation Co. Ltd. c. La Reine, 2004 CAF 403 [Main Rehabilitation], par. 6, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il est \u00ab ...\u00e9vident et manifeste que la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer qu\u2019un avis de cotisation est nul parce qu\u2019il constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure reconnu en common law ou en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Charte \u00bb. Tel que l\u2019indique la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il en est ainsi puisque l\u2019appel log\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 169 de la Loi met en cause la validit\u00e9 de la cotisation, et non pas le processus ayant conduit \u00e0 son \u00e9tablissement (par. 8).\n[38] En plus de la comp\u00e9tence fix\u00e9e l\u00e9gislativement, la Cour, comme tout autre tribunal judiciaire, poss\u00e8de tout pouvoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l\u2019application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire. Ainsi, dans R. c. Cunningham, 2010 CSC 10 [Cunningham], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e ainsi:\n[19] De m\u00eame, dans le cas d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative, le pouvoir de faire respecter sa proc\u00e9dure et le droit de regard sur la mani\u00e8re dont les avocats exercent leurs fonctions s\u2019inf\u00e8rent n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice. Notre Cour a confirm\u00e9 que les pouvoirs d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une \u00ab doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb :\n. . . sont compris dans les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi habilitante non seulement ceux qui y sont express\u00e9ment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, mais aussi, par d\u00e9duction, tous ceux qui sont de fait n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif . . .\n(ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. c. Alberta (Energy and UtilitiesBoard), 2006 CSC 4, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 140, par. 51)\nM\u00eame si, dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge Bastarache renvoie \u00e0 un tribunal administratif, la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire vaut pour un tribunal d\u2019origine l\u00e9gislative.\n[mon soulignement]\n[39] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 ce principe dans l\u2019affaire High-Crest Enterprises Limited c. La Reine, 2017 CAF 88 [High-Crest] (par. 39).\n[40] Cette comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire permet au juge en chef de la Cour de r\u00e9assigner un dossier \u00e0 un autre juge de la Cour lorsqu\u2019un juge a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper sa charge (High-Crest, par. 17-40), ce que les requ\u00e9rants ont reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ne contestent pas.\n[41] Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9, par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, un juge de la Cour d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le juge en chef pour continuer les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants peut d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en s\u2019assurant que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, qui pourrait \u00eatre de rendre jugement sur dossiers ou encore, d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, m\u00eame sans l\u2019accord des parties (D\u2019Amico, par. 44).\n[42] Par application de la doctrine de la comp\u00e9tence par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, les juges de la Cour ont le pouvoir de faire respecter la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour et d\u2019avoir un droit de regard sur la mani\u00e8re dont les avocats exercent leurs fonctions, \u00e9tant un pouvoir s\u2019inf\u00e9rant n\u00e9cessairement du pouvoir de constituer une cour de justice (Cunningham, par. 19).\n[43] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e ainsi:\n35 Les juges disposent, pour emp\u00eacher les abus de proc\u00e9dure, d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel inh\u00e9rent\u2026\n[44] Dans Toronto (ville de) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (S.C.F.P.), section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 [Ville de Toronto], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de common law comme des proc\u00e9dures injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et en un traitement oppressif et vise essentiellement \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la fonction judiciaire (Ville de Toronto, par. 35 et 43). De fa\u00e7on plus pr\u00e9cise, la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure de common law y a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n37 \u2026Le juge Goudge a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 la notion de la fa\u00e7on suivante aux par. 55 et 56 :\n[TRADUCTION] La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure engage le pouvoir inh\u00e9rent du tribunal d\u2019emp\u00eacher que ses proc\u00e9dures soient utilis\u00e9es abusivement, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui serait manifestement injuste envers une partie au litige, ou qui aurait autrement pour effet de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019administration de la justice. C\u2019est une doctrine souple qui ne s\u2019encombre pas d\u2019exigences particuli\u00e8res telles que la notion d\u2019irrecevabilit\u00e9 (voir House of Spring Gardens Ltd. c. Waite, [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347, p. 358, [1990] 2 All E.R. 990 (C.A.).\n[mon soulignement]\n[45] Ainsi, la Cour peut prendre toutes les mesures qu\u2019elle juge n\u00e9cessaires et appropri\u00e9es pour faire respecter la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour lorsqu\u2019une partie en abuse, et non pas lorsqu\u2019une partie pr\u00e9tend que c\u2019est la Cour elle-m\u00eame qui abuse de ses propres proc\u00e9dures. Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Yacyshyn c. R. (1999), 99 D.T.C. 5133, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu abus de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour puisque l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 ses obligations quant aux interrogatoires pr\u00e9alable et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, la Cour avait le pouvoir de radier certaines parties des all\u00e9gations contenues \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel (voir \u00e9galement Main Rehabilitation, par. 7).\n[46] Il serait aussi permis \u00e0 la Cour de mettre fin \u00e0 un litige dans le cas o\u00f9 une question aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement tranch\u00e9e (par exemple, s\u2019il y a chose jug\u00e9e).\n[47] Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir de la Cour de pr\u00e9venir et contr\u00f4ler un abus de ses proc\u00e9dures par l\u2019adjudication de frais et d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une des parties (Fournier c. Canada, 2005 CAF 131, par. 11).\n[48] Il est \u00e9galement permis \u00e0 la Cour de mettre fin \u00e0 un litige lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la cotisation \u00e9tablie hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus en violation de l\u2019article 8 de la Charte (Canada c. O\u2019Neill Motors Ltd. [1998] 4 F.C. 180 (C.A.)).\nL\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif\n[49] Les requ\u00e9rants demandent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appliquer la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des proc\u00e9dures mises en place par la Cour elle-m\u00eame pour la suite des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, et non pas en regard du comportement des autres parties au litige. En effet, dans le cadre de cette requ\u00eate, les requ\u00e9rants ne soul\u00e8vent aucun geste abusif ou vexatoire qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou l\u2019ARC, ou tout autre abus de proc\u00e9dure de la part de l\u2019autre partie au litige. Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent plut\u00f4t le d\u00e9lai qu\u2019a pris la Cour pour g\u00e9rer le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, qui r\u00e9sulterait selon eux en un abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif comme cette doctrine est appliqu\u00e9e en contexte administratif.\n[50] Les requ\u00e9rants invoquent \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44 [Blencoe], dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable causant un pr\u00e9judice grave pouvait constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Ils invoquent \u00e9galement l\u2019arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Law Society of Saskatchewan et Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29 [Abrametz], dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada se penche \u00e0 nouveau sur la notion de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai excessif en contexte administratif (par. 33-34).\n[51] Selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, il y a deux situations dans lesquelles un d\u00e9lai peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif: i) si l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience est compromise par le d\u00e9lai (si, par exemple, le d\u00e9lai nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une plainte, notamment si les souvenirs se sont estomp\u00e9s, des t\u00e9moins essentiels ne sont plus disponibles ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve perdus) (Blencoe, par. 101-102); et ii) dans les cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019y pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience, si un pr\u00e9judice important a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9lai excessif (Blencoe, par. 122 et 132).\n[52] Lorsque l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est constat\u00e9, les tribunaux doivent d\u00e9terminer les r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es, qui prennent diverses formes, et qui peuvent aller ultimement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures dans les cas les plus manifestes d\u2019abus (Abrametz, par. 74-76; 83-85).\n[53] Selon la Cour, le pouvoir que poss\u00e8de la Cour de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure ne peut permettre \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019annuler des nouvelles cotisations et d\u2019admettre des appels pour le motif du d\u00e9lai qu\u2019a pris la Cour \u00e0 g\u00e9rer un d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice commande qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans le cadre de ces appels. Comme l\u2019a plaid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, si la Cour convenait d\u2019admettre les appels des requ\u00e9rants et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations, cela choquerait le sens de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et \u00e9branlerait la confiance du public dans l\u2019administration de la justice (Abrametz, par. 76 et Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019immigration) c. Tobiass [1997] 3 R.C.S. 391, par. 96).\n[54] De plus, comme la Cour est un d\u00e9cideur judiciaire et non pas un d\u00e9cideur administratif et n\u2019est pas une partie au litige, la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai en contexte administratif n\u2019est pas applicable. Les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par les requ\u00e9rants pour soutenir leurs arguments ne peuvent recevoir application, puisqu\u2019elles r\u00e9f\u00e8rent toutes \u00e0 la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif (Ville de Toronto, Blencoe et Abrametz).\n[55] La Cour souscrit aux commentaires de la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Lassonde c. R, 2003 CCI 715 aux par. 133, 134 et 141, maintenue en appel par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (Lassonde c. Canada, 2005 CAF 323). Dans cette affaire, la Cour a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate du contribuable demandant que son appel soit admis et les cotisations annul\u00e9es pour le motif du d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable qu\u2019avait pris le ministre pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation et pour oppression. La Cour distingue les principes de la d\u00e9cision Blencoe et indique:\n[133] Une cotisation en vertu de la Loi n'est pas une plainte ni un acte d'accusation. Il s'agit tout simplement d'un acte constatant la dette d'un contribuable en vertu de la Loi, dans un syst\u00e8me d'autocotisation.\n[134] Dans la mati\u00e8re couverte par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il y a une partie qui je crois rel\u00e8ve du droit administratif et l'autre qui rel\u00e8ve de la proc\u00e9dure civile. La partie du droit administratif serait celle qui va de la d\u00e9claration de revenu jusqu'\u00e0 la cotisation. \u00c0 partir du moment o\u00f9 un appel d'une cotisation est institu\u00e9 devant notre Cour, qui est une cour de justice ou un tribunal civil, il ne s'agit plus de droit administratif mais de droit civil.\n\u2026.\n[141] Comme nous venons de le voir, une cotisation ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9e pour manque de diligence dans le traitement d'une cotisation. Une fois les proc\u00e9dures devant cette Cour entam\u00e9es, il appartient \u00e0 l'appelant de promouvoir l'audience de sa cause.\n[mon soulignement]\n[56] Toutefois, m\u00eame si la Cour concluait que la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en cas de d\u00e9lai en contexte administratif \u00e9tait applicable \u00e0 notre Cour, les d\u00e9lais encourus dans le cadre des dossiers des requ\u00e9rants ne donnent pas ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019application de cette notion, non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la r\u00e9paration recherch\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants. En effet, la Cour conclut que si elle ordonnait la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, le d\u00e9lai encouru dans ces dossiers n\u2019affecterait pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience. De plus, la Cour conclut que le d\u00e9lai depuis la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ces appels n\u2019est pas excessif. En effet, les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de ces appels doivent \u00eatre prises en compte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour \u00e9valuer ce d\u00e9lai.\n[57] Les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9tendent que le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu le 9 novembre 2017 et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas responsables du d\u00e9lai de 26 mois \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les mois de novembre 2017 et janvier 2020, puisque l\u2019appel log\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en octobre 2019 l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9ventive. Ainsi, selon les requ\u00e9rants, un d\u00e9lai de 53 mois s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des affaires en novembre 2017 et le moment o\u00f9 les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es du d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite de la juge pr\u00e9sidente, soit au mois de mars 2022.\n[58] La Cour ne peut retenir cette fa\u00e7on qu\u2019ont les requ\u00e9rants de calculer les d\u00e9lais. Tout d\u2019abord, le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u2019a pas commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir le 9 novembre 2017. La juge pr\u00e9sidente a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audition des appels qu\u2019elle mettait ces dossiers en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve de la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve, \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les appelants, soit les requ\u00e9rants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n\u00ab \u2026 je vous remercie, et puis n\u00e9cessairement, je vais prendre \u00e7a sur d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, mais non seulement \u00e7a, il faut que j\u2019attende d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre qu\u2019on proc\u00e8de avec la requ\u00eate. \u00bb (transcriptions, 9 novembre 2017, p. 233, lignes 7 \u00e0 10).\n[59] De plus, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture du proc\u00e8s le lundi 30 octobre 2017, la juge pr\u00e9sidente a fait part de son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont avis\u00e9 la Cour de leur intention de pr\u00e9senter une telle requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire pour exclusion de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, soit par simple lettre envoy\u00e9e au greffe de la Cour le jeudi 26 octobre 2017, et ce, sans suivre les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour. De longues discussions se sont poursuivies le matin du 30 octobre 2017 quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der, soit d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audition des appels pr\u00e9vue pour deux semaines afin de permettre aux requ\u00e9rants de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme, avec affidavit et observations \u00e9crites, ou soit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition des appels, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019objection des requ\u00e9rants au d\u00e9p\u00f4t par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus par l\u2019ARC dans le cadre de la perquisition, \u00e9tant entendu que cette requ\u00eate serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et entendue \u00e0 un moment \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la Cour, en fonction de la disponibilit\u00e9 des parties, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition des appels. Comme la juge pr\u00e9sidente l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 :\n\u00ab C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle c\u2019est tr\u00e8s triste, mais on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019envers. Mais comme je vous dis, c\u2019est soit \u00e7a ou on ajourne tout et puis on revient l\u2019an prochain \u00bb (transcriptions, 30 octobre 2017, p. 74, lignes 7-10).\n[60] Les requ\u00e9rants ont convenu au proc\u00e8s que l\u2019audition des appels devait avoir lieu comme pr\u00e9vu et qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9senteraient leur requ\u00eate par la suite. Il est donc fort inappropri\u00e9 pour les requ\u00e9rants de se plaindre aujourd\u2019hui de ces d\u00e9lais.\n[61] La d\u00e9cision de la juge pr\u00e9sidente sur la requ\u00eate pour exclusion de preuve, entendue en f\u00e9vrier 2019, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 29 ao\u00fbt 2019, et port\u00e9e en appel par les requ\u00e9rants en octobre 2019. L\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 20 janvier 2020, mais enregistr\u00e9e au greffe de la Cour qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de juillet 2021. Il faut noter que l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019aucune circonstance exceptionnelle ne justifie l\u2019intervention imm\u00e9diate de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les dossiers des requ\u00e9rants, contrairement \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9tentions. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale indique \u00e9galement dans l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il \u00ab ..serait particuli\u00e8rement inappropri\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de retarder davantage l\u2019\u00e9mission du jugement au m\u00e9rite de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (CCI) sur le fond, surtout que celui-ci est attendu depuis d\u00e9j\u00e0 longtemps \u00bb.\n[62] De plus, environ 10 mois s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre le moment o\u00f9 les appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s pour audition en d\u00e9cembre 2016 et le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition des appels le 30 octobre 2017. Toutefois, ce n\u2019est que deux jours avant la date du d\u00e9but du proc\u00e8s que les requ\u00e9rants indiquent leur intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire pour exclusion de preuve, par simple lettre envoy\u00e9e au greffe.\n[63] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les requ\u00e9rants ne peuvent aujourd\u2019hui se plaindre du d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les mois de novembre 2017 et janvier 2020.\n[64] \u00c9galement, la Cour conclut que 18 mois doivent \u00eatre soustraits du calcul du d\u00e9lai effectu\u00e9 par les requ\u00e9rants, soit le d\u00e9lai entre les mois de janvier 2020 (ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) et de juillet 2021 (enregistrement de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au plumitif de la Cour). En effet, entre les mois de janvier 2020 et juillet 2021, s\u2019apercevant que l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrite au plumitif de la Cour, les requ\u00e9rants auraient d\u00fb communiquer avec la Cour. Ce sera toutefois l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui s\u2019en chargera \u00e0 la fin du mois de juillet 2021 afin de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir du jugement au m\u00e9rite sur le fond dans ces appels.\n[65] Lorsque toutes les circonstances sont prises en consid\u00e9ration, il est fort \u00e9tonnant que les requ\u00e9rants maintiennent qu\u2019ils ne sont pas responsables des d\u00e9lais encourus dans leurs dossiers.\n[66] Ainsi, puisque la juge pr\u00e9sidente a quitt\u00e9 la Cour huit (8) mois apr\u00e8s l\u2019inscription au plumitif de la Cour de l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour conclut que ce d\u00e9lai ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9lai excessif, comme l\u2019entend la notion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en contexte administratif.\n[67] Pour faire cette \u00e9valuation, le Cour a pris en compte les Principes de d\u00e9ontologie judiciaire \u00e9labor\u00e9s par le Conseil canadien de la magistrature qui pr\u00e9voit que, sauf circonstances particuli\u00e8res, les juges ayant mis une affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devraient rendre leur jugement dans les six mois qui suivent l\u2019audience (article 3.B.2).\nPROC\u00c9DURE \u00c0 SUIVRE POUR LA SUITE\n[68] Comme l\u2019indique la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision High-Crest, le nouveau juge saisi de l\u2019affaire d\u00e9terminera la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour la suite :\n[101] Apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9affectation, le nouveau juge est saisi de l\u2019affaire. Il appartient \u00e0 ce juge, et non au juge en chef, de recevoir les observations des parties concernant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019instance, par exemple, s\u2019il y a lieu de tenir une nouvelle audience ou si le dossier actuel (y compris les transcriptions) devrait servir en tout ou en partie (D\u2019Amico c. Wiemken, 2010 ABQB 785, 47 Alta. L.R. (5th) 414; Parmar c. Bayley, 2001 BCSC 1394, 19 C.P.C. (5th) 366).\n[69] Pour d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, la Cour doit s\u2019assurer que les parties ont un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, favorisant \u00ab la saine gestion de l\u2019instance en appliquant des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ad\u00e9quats, efficients par l\u2019application juste, simple, proportionn\u00e9e et \u00e9conomique de la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Schwimmer c. Gaudreault-Martel, 2022 QCCQ 1631 [Gaudreault-Martel], par. 52) tout en respectant le principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 (Gaudreault-Martel, par. 53) (observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9, par. 50-52). La Cour, comme tout autre tribunal, doit respecter les principes de justice naturelle et maintenir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[70] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour ordonne que jugement au m\u00e9rite sur le fond dans ces appels soit rendu sur la base des dossiers. Les parties pourront, si elles le souhaitent, soumettre des observations additionnelles orales et \u00e9crites quant aux questions en litige dans ces appels. La Cour se r\u00e9serve \u00e9galement le droit de rappeler tout t\u00e9moin.\n[71] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour conclut que la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s serait vraisemblablement in\u00e9quitable pour les requ\u00e9rants, puisque M. Plante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas d\u00e9bourser les honoraires juridiques estim\u00e9s par ses avocats pour la pr\u00e9paration et la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s (d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Plante, par. 38 et 39). Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 lui seul est d\u00e9cisif pour \u00e9carter l\u2019option de tenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s. De plus, la Cour a pris en compte le fait que de rappeler tous les t\u00e9moins pour t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 nouveau dans le cadre d\u2019un second proc\u00e8s ne serait pas ad\u00e9quat ni proportionn\u00e9. Puisque la Cour n\u2019ordonne pas la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, les pr\u00e9tentions des requ\u00e9rants \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les droits de M. Plante prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019article 7 de la Charte seront bafou\u00e9s par la tenue d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s ne seront pas examin\u00e9es.\n[72] Au cours de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, les requ\u00e9rants ont reconnu qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient aucun reproche \u00e0 formuler quant au processus suivi lors du proc\u00e8s tenu en octobre et novembre 2017, ce processus ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quitable. Les requ\u00e9rants ont \u00e9galement convenu que les interrogatoires et contre-interrogatoires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te lors de l\u2019audition des appels en 2017 (transcriptions, 28 avril 2023, p.23 (lignes 17-28) et p.24 (lignes 1 \u00e0 11)).\n[73] Ainsi, les dossiers de la Cour sont complets r\u00e9duisant toute iniquit\u00e9 : la preuve est close \u00e0 la satisfaction des parties (transcriptions, 3 novembre 2017, p. 182, lignes 19 \u00e0 21 pour les requ\u00e9rants, et transcriptions, 7 novembre 2017, p. 178, lignes 9 et 10 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9), et les plaidoiries sont termin\u00e9es. \u00c9galement, la Cour a acc\u00e8s aux transcriptions des audiences tant \u00e9crites que sonores, ce qui est un facteur privil\u00e9giant que la Cour rende jugement sur la base des dossiers (D\u2019Amico, par. 55 et 62).\n[74] Selon les requ\u00e9rants, les appels log\u00e9s par les requ\u00e9rants requi\u00e8rent qu\u2019un juge \u00e9value la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, cette \u00e9valuation \u00e9tant essentielle pour trancher les questions en litige dans ces dossiers. Le nouveau juge qui rendrait jugement sur la base des dossiers ne pourrait \u00e9valuer le langage corporel des t\u00e9moins, et ainsi, ce mode de fonctionnement ne peut se substituer au premier proc\u00e8s.\n[75] Les requ\u00e9rants ont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Singh c. Ministre de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration [1985] 1 R.C.S. 177 :\n59. Je ferai cependant remarquer que, m\u00eame si les auditions fond\u00e9es sur des observations \u00e9crites sont compatibles avec les principes de justice fondamentale pour certaines fins, elles ne donnent pas satisfaction dans tous les cas. Je pense en particulier que, lorsqu'une question importante de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est en cause, la justice fondamentale exige que cette question soit tranch\u00e9e par voie d'audition. Les cours d'appel sont bien conscientes de la faiblesse inh\u00e9rente des transcriptions lorsque des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont en jeu et elles sont donc tr\u00e8s peu dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9viser les conclusions des tribunaux qui ont eu l'avantage d'entendre les t\u00e9moins en personne: voir l'arr\u00eat Stein c. Le navire \u00ab Kathy K \u00bb, [1976] 2 R.C.S. 802, aux pp. 806 \u00e0 808 (le juge Ritchie). Je puis difficilement concevoir une situation o\u00f9 un tribunal peut se conformer \u00e0 la justice fondamentale en tirant, uniquement \u00e0 partir d'observations \u00e9crites, des conclusions importantes en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[mon soulignement]\n[76] Ces commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada datent de 1985 et ne prennent pas en compte la disponibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019enregistrement sonore des audiences, et qui sont disponibles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, bien qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour un juge de voir un t\u00e9moin, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ne s\u2019\u00e9value pas uniquement en \u00e9valuant le langage corporel des t\u00e9moins et peut s\u2019\u00e9valuer en examinant la d\u00e9position orale du t\u00e9moin (Francis c. La Reine, 2007 CCI 323, par. 15; Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334, par. 23; D\u2019Amico, par. 61 et 62).\n[77] Afin d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage, la Cour pourra, entre autre, tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants:\ni)les incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses de ce t\u00e9moignage \u2013 par exemple si le t\u00e9moignage change au cours du proc\u00e8s ou s\u2019il diff\u00e8re de celui rendu par d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins ou encore, s\u2019il diff\u00e8re de la preuve documentaire;\nii)les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences;\niii)les raisons que le t\u00e9moin pourrait avoir \u00e0 rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou \u00e0 induire la Cour en erreur;\niv)la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve : \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour peut rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[78] \u00c9galement, la Cour retient les commentaires \u00e9mis par le juge Stratas dans High-Crest :\n[116] En outre, la nature des affaires m\u00eames et le contexte dans lequel elles sont tranch\u00e9es comptent pour beaucoup. Les affaires o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 de la personne est en jeu, comme les affaires criminelles, celles o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages de vive voix sont nombreux et o\u00f9 les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont d\u00e9terminantes \u2014 au point o\u00f9 la reprise de l\u2019instance pourrait se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler injuste\u2014, et les affaires o\u00f9 la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision administrative publique est contest\u00e9e appellent le juge en chef \u00e0 une grande prudence lorsqu\u2019il envisage de les r\u00e9affecter.\n[mon soulignement]\n[79] Les requ\u00e9rants ont \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que la juge pr\u00e9sidente avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile et complexe de se retrouver dans la preuve documentaire. Ils soul\u00e8vent donc que de demander \u00e0 un autre juge de comprendre toute la preuve et de rendre jugement sur la base des dossiers est un exercice p\u00e9rilleux pouvant mener \u00e0 une injustice pour les parties. La Cour ne peut retenir cet argument des requ\u00e9rants puisqu\u2019une r\u00e9vision attentive des transcriptions permettra \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019\u00e9valuer correctement la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue en octobre et novembre 2017 et de rendre jugement sur cette base.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 1e jour de juin 2023.\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nJuge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2023 CCI 79\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2015-1917(IT)G, 2015-1921(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nSPE VALEUR ASSURABLE INC. & ROBERT PLANTE ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nOttawa (Canada)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 28 Avril 2023\nMOTIFS DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE PAR :\nL'honorable juge Dominique Lafleur\nDATE DE L\u2019ORDONNANCE :\nLe 1 juin 2023\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocats des appelants :\nMe Gabriel Dumais\nMe Francis Fortin\nAvocat de l'intim\u00e9 :\nMe Vlad Zolia\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l'appelant:\nNom :\nCabinet :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

Introduction\n[1] L\u2019appelante a interjet\u00e9 appel en vertu de la proc\u00e9dure informelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie en application de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (LIR) par le ministre du Revenu national (ministre), pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018. En vertu de cette cotisation, le ministre a impos\u00e9 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 5 858 $ en application du paragraphe 227(9) de la LIR en raison de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s versements tardifs de retenues \u00e0 la source sur les salaires pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018 pour un total de 61 084,96 $.\n[2] Le paragraphe 227(9) de la LIR dispose ce qui suit :\nRetenue des imp\u00f4ts\nD\u00e9faut de remettre une retenue \u00e0 la source\n(9) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (9.5), toute personne qui ne remet pas ou ne paye pas au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e civile, de la mani\u00e8re et dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi ou \u00e0 son r\u00e8glement, un montant d\u00e9duit ou retenu conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi ou \u00e0 son r\u00e8glement ou un montant d\u2019imp\u00f4t qu\u2019elle doit payer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 116 ou \u00e0 une disposition r\u00e9glementaire prise en application du paragraphe 215(4) est passible d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 :\na) soit, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) :\n(i) [\u2026],\n(ii) si le receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral re\u00e7oit ce montant :\n(A) [\u2026],\n(B) [\u2026],\n(C) [\u2026],\n(iii) si ce montant n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9 ou remis au plus tard le septi\u00e8me jour suivant la date o\u00f9 il est exigible, de 10 % du montant;\nb) soit de 20 % du montant qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre remis ou pay\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e si, au moment du d\u00e9faut, une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 en application du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe \u00e9tait payable par la personne et si le d\u00e9faut a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde.\n[3] La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait de 10 %.\n[4] La d\u00e9cision du ministre d\u2019imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 d\u00e9coule essentiellement d\u2019un conflit entre les parties concernant les salaires vers\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante \u00e0 deux employ\u00e9s. L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9termin\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2018, une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration finale \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 un examen des comptes de fiducie de la paie de l\u2019appelante pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 une r\u00e9partition salariale diff\u00e9rente entre les deux employ\u00e9s, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une reformulation des versements de retenues sur la paie de l\u2019appelante en vertu de la LIR et du R\u00e8glement applicable. La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur les versements tardifs de l\u2019appelante.\n[5] L\u2019unique actionnaire, administrateur et dirigeant de l\u2019appelante est M. Allan Sutton. L\u2019appelante exploite une entreprise immobili\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d\u00e9tentrice de permis plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re personnelle. M. Sutton est un agent de ventes immobili\u00e8res et est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme la principale source de recettes de l\u2019appelante. Mme Angela Sutton, conjointe de M. Sutton, est \u00e9galement employ\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante. Elle est une courti\u00e8re agr\u00e9\u00e9e agissant \u00e0 titre de courti\u00e8re gestionnaire aux fins des activit\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res de l\u2019appelante. Son statut permet \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019\u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d\u00e9tentrice de permis. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Mme Sutton, l\u2019appelante peut exercer ses activit\u00e9s sans d\u00e9pendre d\u2019une maison de courtage. M. Sutton d\u00e9crit cet avantage comme une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e obligeant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir des comptes de fiducie, \u00e0 faire des rapports comptables, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des rapports annuels aupr\u00e8s de la Financial Services Authority de la province. M. Sutton ajoute qu\u2019une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e entra\u00eene une gouvernance \u00e0 un niveau beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[6] M. et Mme Sutton sont les deux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante. Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelante, en vertu de l\u2019entente conclue entre M. et Mme Sutton, d\u00e9termine \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e la contribution que chacun a apport\u00e9e au succ\u00e8s et aux recettes de l\u2019appelante pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sutton, Mme Sutton est un ajout cl\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante et, sans elle, le succ\u00e8s de l\u2019appelante serait certainement diff\u00e9rent. Elle lui permet de se concentrer sur des aspects particuliers des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante tout en \u00e9tant charg\u00e9e de toutes les autres t\u00e2ches. De plus, elle l\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de mandats particuliers au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Elle peut aussi trouver des aiguillages. Pour M. Sutton, elle est un atout pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et m\u00e9rite une juste reconnaissance.\n[7] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2018, l\u2019appelante a vers\u00e9 de retenues sur la paie en fonction d\u2019une estimation du salaire de chaque employ\u00e9. \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, les deux employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9 leur examen de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 un salaire en fonction de leurs contributions dans l\u2019entreprise. Les formulaires et les feuillets pr\u00e9vus par r\u00e8glement pour 2018 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante en fonction de ces r\u00e9sultats. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme et M. Sutton ont re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale de 165 000 $ et de 192 000 $, respectivement.\n[8] Au moyen d\u2019un avis de cotisation dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2020, le ministre a \u00e9tabli une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelante visant un versement tardif du solde des retenues sur la paie pour 2018 de 1 745 $ et il lui a impos\u00e9 une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 correspondante de 10 %, soit 124 $. Cette cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019examen des comptes de fiducie par l\u2019ARC. L\u2019ARC a d\u00e9termin\u00e9, entre autres, une r\u00e9partition de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rente entre les deux employ\u00e9s en fonction des montants d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans les comptes bancaires personnels de Mme et de M. Sutton sous forme de ch\u00e8ques re\u00e7us de l\u2019appelante.\n[9] Une deuxi\u00e8me cotisation au moyen d\u2019un avis de cotisation dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2020 a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des versements des retenues sur la paie de l\u2019appelante pour 2018 strictement pour imposer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour versement tardif de 10 %, soit 5 858 $. Cette deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 concerne une r\u00e9affectation des versements mensuels de retenue sur la paie par l\u2019ARC que l\u2019appelante aurait d\u00fb faire en fonction de la nouvelle r\u00e9partition de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les deux employ\u00e9s. Seule cette deuxi\u00e8me cotisation fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel.\n[10] Le pr\u00e9sent appel vise \u00e0 trancher une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience que le fardeau de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 incombe \u00e0 la Couronne. Cela signifie que, si la r\u00e9affectation de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e ou, devrais-je dire, n\u2019est pas \u00e9tablie par l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de maintenir la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a cit\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 que le seul fondement pour le ministre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette nouvelle d\u00e9termination de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les deux employ\u00e9s s\u2019appuie sur le seul examen des relev\u00e9s bancaires de l\u2019appelante, des copies des ch\u00e8ques de l\u2019appelante et \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de qui les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9taient \u00e9tablis. Selon ce seul examen, les ch\u00e8ques et relev\u00e9s bancaires confirmaient que le montant total de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des deux employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le compte bancaire personnel de M. Sutton, sauf un montant total de 12 675 $ qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le compte bancaire personnel de Mme Sutton.\n[12] La Cour n\u2019a entendu aucun agent ou employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC. Au cours de l\u2019examen des comptes de fiducie par l\u2019ARC, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e ni invit\u00e9e \u00e0 expliquer les motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019option de paiement retenue par l\u2019appelante, ni Mme Sutton, ni M. Sutton, ni leur comptable.\n[13] Pour la Cour, la proc\u00e9dure suivie par l\u2019ARC consistant \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen n\u2019est pas la plus convaincante. La proc\u00e9dure indique clairement un examen s\u00e9lectif, ce qui donne l\u2019apparence d\u2019un examen partiel seulement du contexte r\u00e9el. Cela ressort particuli\u00e8rement de l\u2019absence de tout t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019ARC pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se et de tout contact pendant la v\u00e9rification des comptes de fiducie avec les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Cela est plut\u00f4t probl\u00e9matique dans un contexte o\u00f9 le fardeau incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[14] Mme et M. Sutton ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Cour estime que les deux sont cr\u00e9dibles. Tous deux ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une connaissance de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019expliquer en termes raisonnables les consid\u00e9rations relatives \u00e0 leur d\u00e9cision de fixer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration vers\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante.\n[15] M. Sutton a \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le t\u00e9moin n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 les montants qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante. Il a expos\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont ils s\u2019entendent sur leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et le moment auquel ils le font. Il signe les ch\u00e8ques de l\u2019appelante. La Cour comprend qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une entreprise relativement petite et que, compte tenu de la volatilit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s, il peut \u00eatre difficile de pr\u00e9voir une juste r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sans savoir ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par chacun d\u2019eux avant la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Il a expliqu\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles sa conjointe recevait une petite r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration mensuelle vers\u00e9e directement \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re et quelle \u00e9tait l\u2019origine de ce montant. Mme Sutton confirme \u00e9galement les m\u00eames raisons pour lesquelles sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est un honoraire mensuel, soit l\u2019honoraire qu\u2019elle facturait \u00e0 d\u2019autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res en contrepartie de ses services de courtage de base.\n[16] Il n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 que les deux r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son compte bancaire personnel sous forme d\u2019un seul ch\u00e8que qu\u2019il signe en fonction des flux de tr\u00e9sorerie disponibles de l\u2019appelante, de temps \u00e0 autre. Il n\u2019a pas confirm\u00e9 que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait le sien seul. Il a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente et qu\u2019il aurait pu signer deux ch\u00e8ques. Il n\u2019estimait pas que cela \u00e9tait d\u00e9terminant dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils s\u2019entendent tous deux sur la proc\u00e9dure et la r\u00e9partition finale qu\u2019ils d\u00e9terminent \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Pour lui, les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts dans un seul compte et le droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quitable \u00e9taient distincts et l\u2019un n\u2019\u00e9tait certainement pas un gage de l\u2019autre.\n[17] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Sutton portait sur sa propre compr\u00e9hension de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 relativement br\u00e8ve, mais claire et v\u00e9ridique. La Cour n\u2019a pas cru que son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait marginal, mais qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une v\u00e9ritable employ\u00e9e \u00e0 qui une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e en contrepartie d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable rendement. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, son rendement de travail dans l\u2019ensemble pouvait varier au cours des ann\u00e9es et elle devait assumer, chaque ann\u00e9e, ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de courti\u00e8re agr\u00e9\u00e9e.\n[18] Mme Sutton a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour elle, le fait que sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le compte bancaire personnel de son conjoint ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9occupation. Elle a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet argent. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 clairement qu\u2019elle consentait \u00e0 cette entente et elle a autoris\u00e9 que l\u2019argent soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans un seul compte. Voici la fa\u00e7on dont elle a expliqu\u00e9 la situation : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] Je recevais de l\u2019argent de fa\u00e7on constructive par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de notre compte [\u2026]. Donc, le compte paierait mes factures directes personnelles, mon visa, et il payait aussi nos d\u00e9penses partag\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[19] Le contre-interrogatoire n\u2019a pas permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9molir les th\u00e8ses exprim\u00e9es par les deux t\u00e9moins. Il n\u2019est cependant pas exclu que la pi\u00e8ce A-1 et la pi\u00e8ce A-7 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante d\u00e9montrent une certaine divergence quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination exacte du salaire vers\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9. Cela s\u2019explique notamment par le fait confirm\u00e9 par Mme Sutton au sujet du pourcentage des d\u00e9penses communes qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es en 2018. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que sa part des d\u00e9penses communes \u00e9tait de 11 % et non de 50 %. Cette confirmation pourrait \u00eatre fausse ou exacte. Pour cette raison, la r\u00e9partition telle que d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine entre l\u2019appelante et les employ\u00e9s serait alors erron\u00e9e.\n[20] Nonobstant le paragraphe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il demeure clair pour la Cour que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Sutton en 2018, d\u00e9passait 12 675 $. Le fait qu\u2019une telle r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 en partie vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Sutton par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du compte bancaire de M. Sutton n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la th\u00e8se de Mme Sutton et de l\u2019appelante selon laquelle elle a touchait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019appelante. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayent le fait que Mme Sutton a autoris\u00e9 que les montants soient vers\u00e9s dans le compte bancaire de M. Sutton, qu\u2019elle tirait toujours un avantage du d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans ce compte, et qu\u2019elle avait un droit inconditionnel de se faire payer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, le principe de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e s\u2019applique.\n[21] Le principe de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, aux fins de la LIR, comporte deux facteurs centraux qui permettent \u00e0 un contribuable de [traduction] \u00ab recevoir \u00bb des fonds m\u00eame s\u2019il ne les a pas directement [traduction] \u00ab entre ses mains \u00bb. Selon le paragraphe 5 (1) de la LIR, le revenu est un salaire tir\u00e9 par un contribuable au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e. La jurisprudence a rappel\u00e9 que le mot [traduction] \u00ab recevoir \u00bb signifie obtenir ou tirer un avantage de quelque chose, donc [traduction] \u00ab en jouir sans n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019avoir entre les mains \u00bb[1]. En outre, une somme d\u2019argent est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre re\u00e7ue par un employ\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle est \u00e0 sa disposition[2]. La d\u00e9cision Blenkarn offre un exemple o\u00f9 l\u2019argent pour payer le salaire du contribuable en 1960 \u00e9tait disponible [pour le contribuable], mais il a volontairement choisi de ne pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9 avant 1961. Le contribuable a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u l\u2019argent parce que le paiement \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme [traduction] \u00ab re\u00e7u \u00bb d\u00e8s qu\u2019il avait un droit inconditionnel d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9, soit en 1960.\n[22] Dans la d\u00e9cision Markman[3], la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019une somme est vers\u00e9e par un employeur \u00e0 un tiers au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du contribuable, le paiement constitue une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e entre les mains du contribuable. Dans la d\u00e9cision Belusic[4], le juge Bowman a soulign\u00e9 que, pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, il faut satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des deux conditions suivantes, ou aux deux :\n1)L\u2019appelante devrait autoriser le paiement ou, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, y consentir\n2)M\u00eame dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle n\u2019avait pas autoris\u00e9 le paiement ou n\u2019y avait pas acquiesc\u00e9, il aurait fallu au moins qu\u2019il ait l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale d\u2019effectuer le remboursement de sorte que le paiement [\u2026] avait pour effet de le lib\u00e9rer de cette obligation\n[23] Les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par le juge Bowman pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s dans des affaires ult\u00e9rieures. Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour, dans la d\u00e9cision Sherman[5], en citant la d\u00e9cision Morin, a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 que, selon la th\u00e9orie de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, le prestataire n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u le montant en question, mais n\u2019a re\u00e7u qu\u2019un avantage correspondant. Ces notions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reprises par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cheema[6], citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Innovative Installation[7], qui a conclu que la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e pouvait s\u2019appliquer lorsqu\u2019une personne avait un droit contractuel \u00e0 recevoir un paiement.\n[24] La Cour estime que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le pr\u00e9sent appel soutiennent le fait que la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que Mme Sutton a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019appelante.\n[25] Tel que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, m\u00eame si la Cour ne peut confirmer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration exacte re\u00e7ue par Mme Sutton, et indirectement par M. Sutton, il demeure \u00e9vident que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration utilis\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC pour imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e.\n[26] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Simard[8], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fourni des \u00e9claircissements sur la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imposition et de d\u00e9termination de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s. L\u2019arr\u00eat Simard portait sur les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour faute lourde en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) de la LIR. Toutefois, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a utilis\u00e9 un libell\u00e9 large dans ses commentaires sur la mesure dans laquelle la Cour peut intervenir dans l\u2019imposition de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s. La Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa d\u00e9cision du ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e par voie d\u2019appel devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la cotisation qui la pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve, mais dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Cour constate que les faits y donnent ouverture, elle ne peut que la confirmer. En tant que ministre, la Cour n\u2019a aucune discr\u00e9tion quant au montant de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019en a concernant les int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[27] Dans la d\u00e9cision Portland[9], le juge Mogan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLes obligations de retenir sont rigides, et celles de remettre les sommes sont \u00e9galement rigides. La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 227(9) est prescrite par la loi, et la Cour n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence de r\u00e9duire cette p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019annuler, parce qu\u2019elle est impos\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur. Si l\u2019on satisfait aux conditions qui d\u00e9clenchent l\u2019application de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 (versement tardif), alors l\u2019obligation est \u00e9tablie.\n[28] Le r\u00f4le de la Cour consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non valablement impos\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre question en appel. De plus, ajuster le montant d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e outrepasserait la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour. Pour ce motif, il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne permettent pas de conclure que les conditions d\u2019imposition de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par le ministre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies. En effet, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration re\u00e7ue par les employ\u00e9s et utilis\u00e9e par le ministre pour imposer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 est erron\u00e9e et entra\u00eene n\u00e9cessairement une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 erron\u00e9e.\n[29] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les faits du pr\u00e9sent appel ne donnent pas lieu \u00e0 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le ministre. La Cour n\u2019a aucun pouvoir en mati\u00e8re de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, autre que d\u2019accueillir (refuser la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9) ou de rejeter (confirmer la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9) l\u2019appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli, sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Belleville (Ontario), ce 8e jour de janvier2024.\n\u00ab J.M.

Malgr\u00e9 son affirmation orale selon laquelle il avait l\u2019intention de le faire, je conclus que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019appelant sont insuffisants pour les motifs suivants :\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas eu les moyens de payer l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que annuelle de 20 820 $ \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un revenu d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de moins de 15 000 $ en 2010;\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9occupation, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 que son revenu r\u00e9el en 2010 d\u00e9passait le montant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, car il n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son revenu en esp\u00e8ces dans cette d\u00e9claration.

Au contraire, cela n\u2019a fait que diminuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant;\nLe t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant selon lequel ses parents l\u2019ont aid\u00e9 \u00e0 acheter l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement contredisait son propre avis d\u2019appel dans lequel il all\u00e9guait que sa partenaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque l\u2019avait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 acheter l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement;\nLe t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant selon lequel ses parents ne l\u2019aidaient plus avec les d\u00e9penses de l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement contredisait son propre avis d\u2019appel dans lequel il all\u00e9guait que sa partenaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque ne l\u2019aidait plus avec les d\u00e9penses de l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement;\nM\u00eame si le document hypoth\u00e9caire ne porte pas la signature de son fr\u00e8re, l\u2019appelant a soutenu que son fr\u00e8re avait cosign\u00e9 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que;\nL\u2019appelant s\u2019est montr\u00e9 \u00e9vasif lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 indiquer sa propre signature sur le document hypoth\u00e9caire, admettant seulement qu\u2019il pouvait s\u2019agir d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab signature partielle \u00bb;\nL\u2019appelant ne se souvenait pas de la date \u00e0 laquelle il avait emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement \u2013 m\u00eame pas de quelle saison il s\u2019agissait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[6] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant son intention que l\u2019immeuble vis\u00e9 par le remboursement lui serve de lieu de r\u00e9sidence primaire manquait de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et ne concordait pas avec son propre avis d\u2019appel. Dans de telles circonstances, il est important de souligner que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tay\u00e9s par une preuve documentaire ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve provenant d\u2019un tiers.

La premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9claration a commenc\u00e9 le 1\u1d49\u02b3 d\u00e9cembre 2016 et s\u2019est termin\u00e9e le 31 ao\u00fbt 2018. La deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie a commenc\u00e9 le 1\u1d49\u02b3 d\u00e9cembre 2018 et s\u2019est termin\u00e9e le 31 mai 2019.\n[3] Il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur deux dates critiques. D\u2019abord, il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur la date \u00e0 laquelle le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) a envoy\u00e9 des avis de cotisation \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante. Cette date \u00e9tait le 27 novembre 2019.\n[4] Ensuite, il n\u2019y a pas de litige sur la date \u00e0 laquelle la requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du ministre une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition. Cette date \u00e9tait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\n[5] Il est \u00e9galement admis que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition aupr\u00e8s du ministre dans les 90 jours suivant la date de mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA.\n[6] La seule question en litige consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en temps utile sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition.\nPosition de la Couronne\n[7] Selon la Couronne, la requ\u00e9rante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition avec un jour de retard. Selon la th\u00e8se de la Couronne, la derni\u00e8re date \u00e0 laquelle la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter sa demande au ministre \u00e9tait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\nPosition de la requ\u00e9rante\n[8] La requ\u00e9rante affirme que la derni\u00e8re date \u00e0 laquelle elle aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition \u00e9tait un jour plus tard \u2013 le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u2013 la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a effectivement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande.\n[9] Le paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA accorde un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de mise \u00e0 la poste de l\u2019avis de cotisation pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition. Si cette date limite n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 303(7)a) accorde une ann\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9poser une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai aupr\u00e8s du ministre pour faire opposition. Si le ministre refuse la demande, la Cour peut l\u2019accorder, mais, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 304(5)a), la Cour ne peut l\u2019accorder si elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre dans cette ann\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[10] J\u2019ai reproduit les dispositions pertinentes dans leur contexte l\u00e9gislatif [je souligne] :\n[11] Deux questions relatives au choix du moment se posent. La premi\u00e8re concerne la p\u00e9riode d\u2019opposition de 90 jours et la seconde concerne la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an.\n[12] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question sur le d\u00e9lai d\u00e9pend de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA, qui pr\u00e9voit le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition :\n[13] Dans ses observations, la requ\u00e9rante insiste beaucoup sur le mot \u00ab suivant \u00bb dans l\u2019expression du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA qui pr\u00e9voit que la personne doit pr\u00e9senter un avis d\u2019opposition dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant le jour o\u00f9 l\u2019avis de cotisation lui est envoy\u00e9.\n[14] La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9tend que le mot \u00ab suivant \u00bb signifie que le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition d\u00e9bute le lendemain de l\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis de cotisation par le ministre. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le ministre a envoy\u00e9 des avis de cotisation \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante le 27 novembre 2019, nous devrions compter les 90 jours \u00e0 compter du 28 novembre 2019.\n[15] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, la requ\u00e9rante invoque les paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation :\n27(5) Lorsqu\u2019un acte doit \u00eatre accompli dans un d\u00e9lai qui suit [\u2026] un jour d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ce jour ne compte pas[1].\n[16] La Couronne souscrit \u00e0 cette proposition[2]. Je suis convaincu que cette interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 301(1.1) de la LTA est correcte.\n[17] La requ\u00e9rante soutient ensuite que, puisque le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours commen\u00e7ait le 28 novembre 2019 (soit le lendemain de la mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation), le 90\u1d49 jour tombait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2020[3]. Selon la th\u00e8se de la requ\u00e9rante, le dernier jour pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2020.\n[18] Le calcul par la requ\u00e9rante du d\u00e9lai d\u2019opposition de 90 jours est erron\u00e9. Si on commence \u00e0 compter \u00e0 partir du lendemain de la date de mise \u00e0 la poste des avis de cotisation, soit le 28 novembre 2019, le 90\u1d49 jour tombait effectivement le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition devait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans ces 90 jours, le d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition tombait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. C\u2019\u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition sans avoir \u00e0 demander une prorogation du d\u00e9lai.\n[19] Compte tenu des paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, je suis convaincu que le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020 \u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre un avis d\u2019opposition.\n[20] Maintenant que nous avons fix\u00e9 cette date, comment calculer le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour pr\u00e9senter une demande de prorogation?\n[21] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question sur le d\u00e9lai d\u00e9pend de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des alin\u00e9as 303(7)a) et 304(5)a) de la LTA, qui pr\u00e9voient le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour pr\u00e9senter une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition :\n[22] Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli que le dernier jour o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu pr\u00e9senter au ministre un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e9tait le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020.\n[23] La requ\u00e9rante soutient que la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an devrait \u00eatre comptabilis\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du lendemain du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle s\u2019appuie encore une fois sur les paragraphes 27(4) et 27(5) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\n[24] Si la th\u00e8se de la requ\u00e9rante est exacte, le dernier jour pour d\u00e9poser sa demande \u00e9tait le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u2013 jour o\u00f9 elle a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[25] L\u2019approche de la requ\u00e9rante concernant le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de demande d\u2019un an est erron\u00e9e. Je conviens avec la Couronne que le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e9tait le dernier jour o\u00f9 une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au ministre.\n[26] La faille dans l\u2019argumentation de la requ\u00e9rante r\u00e9sulte de la fusion d\u2019unit\u00e9s de temps. La disposition traitant de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019opposition utilise l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019un jour pour calculer le d\u00e9lai. Les dispositions traitant de la p\u00e9riode de demande utilisent l\u2019unit\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e pour calculer le d\u00e9lai.\n[27] Le paragraphe 37(1) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est la disposition applicable lorsque la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est une ann\u00e9e \u2013 et non les paragraphes 27(4) ou 27(5). Le paragraphe 37(1) de la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation nous dit simplement que l\u2019expression \u00ab ann\u00e9e \u00bb s\u2019entend de toute p\u00e9riode de douze mois cons\u00e9cutifs[4].\n[28] Nous revenons maintenant aux dispositions en cause :\n[29] L\u2019expression \u00ab dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai \u00bb signifie exactement cela \u2013 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration des 90 jours. La derni\u00e8re date qui tombe dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020 est le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2021.\n[30] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au ministre sa demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour faire opposition dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 303(7)a) de la LTA. Je dois donc rejeter la demande de la requ\u00e9rante et je le ferai sans frais.

Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 251(1)c), il faut d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intervenant n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause[4].\n[8] S\u2019ils n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance, l\u2019affaire est close et l\u2019intervenant occupe un emploi assurable.\n[9] S\u2019ils ont un lien de d\u00e9pendance, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(3)b) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011emploi ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intervenant ne sont pas des personnes li\u00e9es.\n[10] Toutefois, bien que le point de vue soit diff\u00e9rent, les consid\u00e9rations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(3)b) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi s\u2019appliquent pour d\u00e9terminer si les parties n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance[5].\nLes faits\n[11] L\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e en 1963 par Mike Kichton. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps et, au cours de la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es 1990, Fred Kichton et Mike Kichton Junior ont pris le contr\u00f4le de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En 2002, Fred Kichton en \u00e9tait l\u2019unique propri\u00e9taire[6].\n[12] L\u2019appelante fournit des services de terrassement commercial, industriel et r\u00e9sidentiel et des services connexes.\n[13] L\u2019intervenant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019appelante en 2002 pendant les mois d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a commenc\u00e9 par faire fonctionner de l\u2019\u00e9quipement; il se souvient que, m\u00eame durant son premier \u00e9t\u00e9, il \u00e9tait contrema\u00eetre op\u00e9rationnel. Vers 2006, Fred a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intervenant de commencer \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Par la suite, il est devenu charg\u00e9 de projet principal, l\u2019un des postes les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise.\n[14] En 2007, l\u2019intervenant est devenu actionnaire. Il a alors acquis 10 % des actions de l\u2019appelante.\n[15] Fred Kichton \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9[7].\n[16] L\u2019intervenant n\u2019est jamais devenu administrateur.\n[17] L\u2019intervenant et Fred s\u2019entendaient tr\u00e8s bien. L\u2019intervenant a d\u00e9crit Fred [traduction] \u00ab comme une figure paternelle \u00bb avec une bonne relation qui s\u2019est poursuivie jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de 2019. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2020[8].\n[18] Bien que la date ne soit pas claire, \u00e0 un certain moment avant avril 2013, Fred a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 planifier et \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des dispositions en vue de sa retraite \u00e9ventuelle et de la cession de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 des personnes cl\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise, y compris son fils, Richard Kichton, et l\u2019intervenant.\n[19] Richard et Fred Kichton \u00e9taient des personnes li\u00e9es au sens de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu[9].\n[20] Une partie du d\u00e9part de Fred de l\u2019entreprise concernait un rachat des actions de Fred par l\u2019appelante. Bien que la preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas les d\u00e9tails de la transaction, il a entra\u00een\u00e9 le paiement d\u2019une somme de 7,4 millions de dollars \u00e0 sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Fredco. Ce pr\u00eat, le pr\u00eat \u00e0 Fredco, est mentionn\u00e9 dans la convention unanime des actionnaires[10].\n[21] Le pr\u00eat \u00e9tait remboursable sur sept ans, ce qui donne lieu \u00e0 un paiement final pr\u00e9vu en 2020.\n[22] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, Fred Kichton \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019appelante. De plus, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le pr\u00eat soit rembours\u00e9, la convention unanime des actionnaires conf\u00e9rait \u00e0 Fred des pouvoirs tr\u00e8s importants sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[23] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention unanime des actionnaires, Fredco pouvait [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] opposer son veto \u00e0 toute r\u00e9solution ou d\u00e9cision des administrateurs ou de tout dirigeant ou employ\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ant\u00e9rieurement ou sur le point de l\u2019\u00eatre, ou abroger ou par ailleurs infirmer une telle r\u00e9solution ou d\u00e9cision [\u2026][11] \u00bb.\n[24] Les dividendes ne pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s sans le consentement de Fred[12].\n[25] \u00c0 la date de la prise d\u2019effet de la convention unanime des actionnaires, le 2 avril 2013, Fred n\u2019avait plus d\u2019actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; toutefois, lui-m\u00eame et sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Fredco, \u00e9taient signataires de la convention.\n[26] Les actionnaires \u00e0 cette date \u00e9taient : 1) l\u2019intervenant qui, directement ou par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9[13] qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait conjointement avec son \u00e9pouse, d\u00e9tenait 20 % des actions de l\u2019appelante, 2) Richard Kichton qui, directement ou par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u00e9tenait 25 % des actions de l\u2019appelante, 3) Christopher Dirks qui, directement ou par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u00e9tenait 25 % des actions de l\u2019appelante et 4) Laurie Conrad qui, directement ou par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u00e9tenait 20 % des actions de l\u2019appelante. De plus, Matus Toth et Cody Williams en d\u00e9tenaient chacun 5 %[14].\n[27] Les propri\u00e9taires \u00e9taient \u00e9galement des employ\u00e9s cl\u00e9s.\n[28] Selon l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019intervenant et les autres actionnaires avaient la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer leurs propres salaires et le montant des dividendes qu\u2019ils recevraient. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis par l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais pas par l\u2019intervenant[15].\n[29] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait admis ces all\u00e9gations, les hypoth\u00e8ses correspondantes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es quelque peu diff\u00e9remment. Elles indiquent que l\u2019intervenant et les autres actionnaires de l\u2019appelante ont collectivement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les conditions d\u2019emploi de l\u2019intervenant[16].\n[30] En ce qui concerne le salaire, m\u00eame si la preuve n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait coh\u00e9rente, j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a eu une sorte de prise de d\u00e9cision largement collective concernant les propri\u00e9taires et Fred pour ce qui est des salaires et des dividendes des propri\u00e9taires employ\u00e9s, y compris l\u2019intervenant. Je ne doute pas que, compte tenu des droits de Fred conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention unanime des actionnaires[17] et de son r\u00f4le de pr\u00e9sident, ses opinions auraient eu beaucoup de poids dans ces discussions[18].\n[31] L\u2019intervenant s\u2019est content\u00e9 d\u2019accepter les d\u00e9cisions qui \u00e9taient prises concernant la r\u00e9partition optimale du salaire, des primes ou des dividendes que lui\u2011m\u00eame et les autres propri\u00e9taires recevraient[19].\n[32] En effet, l\u2019intervenant a convenu en contre-interrogatoire que lui-m\u00eame et les autres employ\u00e9s recevaient un salaire et\/ou des dividendes variables, \u00e9tant entendu qu\u2019une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans les mauvaises ann\u00e9es \u00e9tait compens\u00e9e par un salaire et\/ou des dividendes variables dans les bonnes ann\u00e9es[20].\n[33] L\u2019intervenant \u00e9tait dans une position unique. Tous les charg\u00e9s de projet relevaient de lui, y compris Grant Campbell[21].\n[34] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention unanime des actionnaires, tout actionnaire qui cesse d\u2019\u00eatre un actionnaire est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son emploi sans droit de compensation[22]. L\u2019intervenant \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 depuis assez longtemps avant de signer la convention unanime des actionnaires et il a donc accept\u00e9 cette condition.\n[35] La convention unanime des actionnaires dispose que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 peut exiger des actionnaires qu\u2019ils lui pr\u00eatent de l\u2019argent[23] et qu\u2019ils fournissent des garanties de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux banques et aux pr\u00eateurs[24].\n[36] Vers 2010, l\u2019appelante a fait des travaux de terrassement pour une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9[25] qui d\u00e9veloppait un lotissement. L\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e avec des lots dans le lotissement.\n[37] Certains de ces lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux propri\u00e9taires et \u00e0 Fred, bien que les transferts n\u2019aient pas tous \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Les propri\u00e9taires ont fini par vivre dans ce lotissement.\n[38] Le transfert des lots aux employ\u00e9s s\u2019est fait par la d\u00e9claration de primes \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la valeur du lot. Dans le cas de l\u2019intervenant, cela s\u2019est produit en 2014[26].\nAnalyse\n[39] Il est bien accept\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu que la question de savoir si des personnes qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es n\u2019ont entre elles aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance soit examin\u00e9e en tenant compte des questions suivantes[27] :\nun seul cerveau dirige-t-il les n\u00e9gociations pour les deux parties \u00e0 une transaction?\nles parties \u00e0 une transaction agissent-elles de concert sans int\u00e9r\u00eats distincts?\ny a-t-il un contr\u00f4le de fait[28]?\n[40] Notre Cour reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019appliquer ce genre d\u2019analyse, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e pour l\u2019examen des transactions aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, dans le contexte de l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si les personnes qui entretiennent des relations de travail n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance avec leur employeur[29].\n[41] Il est \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019examiner toutes les circonstances de la relation d\u2019emploi pour d\u00e9terminer si les conditions de la relation d\u2019emploi sont essentiellement semblables \u00e0 celles dont conviendraient des parties sans lien de d\u00e9pendance[30].\n[42] Si les conditions d\u2019emploi sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9es de ce \u00e0 quoi on peut s\u2019attendre entre des parties sans lien de d\u00e9pendance, c\u2019est une forte indication de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de d\u00e9pendance[31].\n[43] Cet exercice peut \u00eatre difficile. Si un particulier occupe un poste qui fait partie de postes tr\u00e8s similaires, l\u2019exercice peut \u00eatre assez simple, mais plus le poste est unique, plus l\u2019exercice est difficile.\n[44] Les parties ont donn\u00e9 des exemples particuliers de certaines conditions qui \u00e9taient ou n\u2019\u00e9taient pas, selon les observations, conformes \u00e0 un arrangement sans lien de d\u00e9pendance.\n[45] Pour d\u00e9terminer si les conditions sont essentiellement semblables \u00e0 celles qui existeraient dans une relation sans lien de d\u00e9pendance, il est important de garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit deux facteurs.\n[46] Premi\u00e8rement, il faut comparer des postes essentiellement similaires. On s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 ce que les conditions d\u2019un op\u00e9rateur d\u2019\u00e9quipement soient diff\u00e9rentes de celles d\u2019un charg\u00e9 de projet, par exemple. Si certains types de comp\u00e9tences sont en p\u00e9nurie, cela peut entra\u00eener des niveaux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rents pour ces postes par rapport \u00e0 des postes par ailleurs semblables qui ne requi\u00e8rent pas ces comp\u00e9tences et qui ne sont pas en p\u00e9nurie.\n[47] De m\u00eame, les diff\u00e9rences entre les employ\u00e9s qui sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur r\u00f4le dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou qui n\u2019augmentent pas leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, que ce soit en salaire ou en avantages sociaux, ne sont pas utiles \u00e0 cet exercice[32].\n[48] Deuxi\u00e8mement, si une diff\u00e9rence avec d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s r\u00e9sulte uniquement du fait qu\u2019il est un actionnaire, ce n\u2019est pas une condition d\u2019emploi.\n[49] Ainsi, le fait que l\u2019intervenant a consenti les pr\u00eats d\u2019actionnaires \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et a fourni des garanties bancaires, ce que la compagnie pouvait exiger conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 de la convention unanime des actionnaires, ne fait pas partie de la relation d\u2019emploi[33].\n[50] En ce qui concerne les crit\u00e8res traditionnels, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, je ne vois pas comment on peut dire qu\u2019un esprit commun dirige \u00e0 la fois l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intervenant, fixant les conditions d\u2019emploi de l\u2019intervenant. De m\u00eame, je ne vois pas comment on pourrait conclure que l\u2019appelante ou l\u2019intervenant exerce un contr\u00f4le de fait sur l\u2019autre.\n[51] En ce qui concerne le crit\u00e8re restant, les propri\u00e9taires employ\u00e9s, y compris l\u2019intervenant, et Fred agissent de concert pour fixer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des propri\u00e9taires employ\u00e9s et pour ce qui est de la r\u00e9partition entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des propri\u00e9taires et les dividendes.\n[52] Ce faisant, ils agissent sans int\u00e9r\u00eats distincts parce qu\u2019ils tiennent compte des int\u00e9r\u00eats des autres en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9s et actionnaires et qu\u2019ils agissent non seulement pour leur propre avantage individuel, mais aussi pour celui des autres dans un contexte de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9[34].\n[53] Cela m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intervenant avaient un lien de d\u00e9pendance.\n[54] En ce qui concerne les conditions d\u2019emploi, il y a des facteurs qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et qui n\u2019indiquent pas clairement l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des situations.\n[55] Par exemple, l\u2019intervenant avait un salaire inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de Grant Campbell, une personne qui relevait de l\u2019appelante. Toutefois, si l\u2019on tient compte du salaire et des primes, l\u2019intervenant a clairement re\u00e7u une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e au cours des ann\u00e9es que nous pouvons comparer. Ce n\u2019est pas un r\u00e9sultat inhabituel[35].\n[56] De plus, il semble que l\u2019intervenant avait ce qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 une allocation de d\u00e9penses de 25 000 $. Si je comprends bien la preuve, cela signifiait qu\u2019il pouvait utiliser \u00e0 des fins personnelles une partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipement de terrassement de l\u2019appelante pour une certaine utilisation correspondant \u00e0 ce montant. Il a utilis\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9quipement. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un avantage inhabituel, mais certains avantages sont li\u00e9s au type d\u2019entreprise dans laquelle on travaille. Il a de la valeur et augmente sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, mais il ne me semble pas \u00e9vident que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration globale soit excessive au point de d\u00e9montrer que les conditions ne pourraient pas \u00eatre des conditions de pleine concurrence[36].\n[57] Selon certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, il y avait des modalit\u00e9s de travail un peu plus souples en ce qui concerne le temps et le lieu de travail de l\u2019intervenant. Il n\u2019est pas rare qu\u2019un employeur ait affaire \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 chevronn\u00e9 de confiance tant que le travail est accompli et que la personne est physiquement pr\u00e9sente lorsque l\u2019interaction en personne est n\u00e9cessaire. Des parties sans lien de d\u00e9pendance auraient certainement pu s\u2019entendre sur ces modalit\u00e9s[37].\n[58] Il y a trois facteurs qui ne sont pas compatibles avec un contrat essentiellement similaire \u00e0 celui dont conviendraient des personnes sans lien de d\u00e9pendance.\nL\u2019acceptation par l\u2019intervenant d\u2019une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s variable en partant du principe qu\u2019une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans les mauvaises ann\u00e9es de l\u2019entreprise sera compens\u00e9e par une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou des dividendes plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans les bonnes ann\u00e9es[38].\nLe fait que l\u2019intervenant, en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9, a son mot \u00e0 dire sur la partie patronale de l\u2019entente m\u00eame si c\u2019est dans une mesure limit\u00e9e.\nAccepter le licenciement automatique d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui cesse de d\u00e9tenir des actions n\u2019est pas quelque chose qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 sans lien de d\u00e9pendance ferait[39].\n[59] Ces facteurs m\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 conclure que, dans l\u2019ensemble, les modalit\u00e9s de ce contrat ne sont pas essentiellement semblables \u00e0 celles d\u2019un contrat sans lien de d\u00e9pendance.\nConclusion\n[60] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intervenant et l\u2019appelante avaient entre eux un lien de d\u00e9pendance et l\u2019appel sera accueilli et :\nLa d\u00e9cision du ministre du Revenu national est modifi\u00e9e pour tenir compte du fait que Russ Giselbrecht n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable pour la p\u00e9riode du 7 janvier 2019 au 20 f\u00e9vrier 2020.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 15e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024.\n\u00ab G.

Voir l\u2019article 18.29 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Parmi les dispositions applicables se trouve le paragraphe 18.15(3) qui indique ce qui suit : [\u2026] Par d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 la loi habilitante, la Cour n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles de preuve lors de l\u2019audition de tels appels; ceux-ci sont entendus d\u2019une mani\u00e8re informelle et le plus rapidement possible, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les circonstances et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 le permettent.\n[3] Cet alin\u00e9a concerne les contribuables et les fiducies personnelles et ne s\u2019applique pas au pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[4] Les faits applicables ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode fournissent le contexte des relations et peuvent \u00eatre pris en compte pour rendre la d\u00e9cision.\n[5] Voir la discussion ci-dessous.\n[6] Transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023, p. 177.\n[7] Transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023, p. 17.\n[8] Transcription du 8 mars 2023, p. 63.\n[9] Aucune autre personne ayant un lien avec les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel n\u2019\u00e9tait li\u00e9e au sens de la LIR.\n[10] Voir la transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023, p. 66 et 167, ainsi que la d\u00e9finition de [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00eats \u00e0 Fredco \u00bb \u00e0 la page 4 de la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 4.\n[11] Voir l\u2019article 3.02.02 de la convention unanime des actionnaires, \u00e0 la page 12 de la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 4, ainsi que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1.01.01(ff), \u00e0 la page 6 de cette convention. D\u2019autres dispositions de cette entente conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 Fred d\u2019autres pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux, notamment les articles 6.01.05 et .06 ainsi que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9.03.02(b) de la convention.\n[12] Voir l\u2019article 9.02.02 de la convention unanime des actionnaires.\n[13] L\u2019appelante d\u00e9tenait toutes les actions avec droit de vote de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[14] Transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023, p. 208 et 210. Il semblerait que Cody Williams ait cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un actionnaire au milieu de 2019 et que Matus Toth ait cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un actionnaire avant ce moment.\n[15] Voir les paragraphes 10 et 11 de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, le paragraphe 2 de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et le paragraphe 20 de l\u2019avis d\u2019intervention.\n[16] Voir les sous-paragraphes 13c, q et s de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel.\n[17] La convention unanime des actionnaires se trouve \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 4.\n[18] Bien que l\u2019intervenant ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne croyait pas avoir beaucoup d\u2019influence, il a convenu que les salaires r\u00e9sultaient d\u2019une discussion entre les propri\u00e9taires et Fred, o\u00f9 ils se sont tous entendus sur ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable. Richard Kichton a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les salaires et les dividendes \u00e9taient d\u00e9termin\u00e9s en tant que groupe. Voir la transcription du 8 mars 2023, p. 17, 18 et 157.\n[19] Voir la transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023, pages 77, 78 (surtout au milieu de la page) et 112, ainsi que les pages 94, 95 en ce qui concerne le transfert des lots entre autres aux propri\u00e9taires salari\u00e9s, sujet dont je discuterai plus loin.\n[20] Voir, notamment, la transcription du 8 mars 2023, p. 164 et 165.\n[21] T\u00e9moignage de Richard Kichton, transcription du 8 mars 2023, p. 118. Bien que M. Campbell soit devenu charg\u00e9 de projet principal, soit le m\u00eame titre que l\u2019intervenant, le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2018 ou vers cette date, il ressort clairement de la lettre d\u2019offre qu\u2019il relevait [traduction] \u00ab directement de Russ Giselbrecht, en plus du groupe de propri\u00e9taires \u00bb. Il se peut fort bien que la gestion des charg\u00e9s de projet ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8re parce que tout le monde connaissait son r\u00f4le et l\u2019accomplissait bien, mais il est tr\u00e8s clair qu\u2019il y avait une ligne hi\u00e9rarchique au besoin. Voir aussi la pi\u00e8ce A-4.\n[22] Voir l\u2019article 9.16.01 de la convention unanime des actionnaires.\n[23] Article 9.07.03.\n[24] Article 9.08.01.\n[25] Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 num\u00e9ro dont l\u2019intervenant \u00e9tait un actionnaire.\n[26] Voir la transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023 aux pages 36, 49 \u00e0 51, 94, 95, 161 et 215. Bien que l\u2019intervenant se souvienne qu\u2019il y avait probablement des dividendes \u00e9gaux \u00e0 la valeur des lots, Laurie Conrad se souvient qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une prime \u00e9gale \u00e0 la valeur des lots. Sur ce point, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Laurie Conrad parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la contr\u00f4leuse de l\u2019appelante et qu\u2019il concorde avec les T4 et les T5 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve : voir les pi\u00e8ces A-2 et A-3. Certains documents indiquent que Laurie Conrad est Laurie Schreiner; les deux noms correspondent \u00e0 la m\u00eame personne.\n[27] Canada c. McLarty, 2008 CSC 26 (CanLII), [2008] 2 RCS 79, au paragraphe 62.\n[28] C.-\u00e0-d. une personne qui dirige les deux parties de la transaction. Voir Keybrand Foods Inc. c. Canada, 2020 CAF 201, aux paragraphes 50 \u00e0 53.\n[29] Voir Martel c. M.R.N., 2017 CCI 238, aux paragraphes 63 \u00e0 65.\n[30] Voir Martel c. M.R.N., 2017 CCI 238, au paragraphe 66. Bien que cette approche puisse sembler surprenante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, je tiens \u00e0 souligner que cela se fait \u00e9galement dans d\u2019autres domaines, par exemple, voir Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157, aux paragraphes 78 \u00e0 90].\n[31] Voir Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157, au paragraphe 84 par analogie.\n[32] Ainsi, la fourniture d\u2019une carte de cr\u00e9dit pour payer les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entreprise ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019examen puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 l\u2019intervenant pour lui permettre de supporter des d\u00e9penses personnelles. De m\u00eame, le fait qu\u2019il avait une cl\u00e9 qui lui donnait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une plus grande partie du bureau que d\u2019autres ne lui conf\u00e8re aucun avantage faisant partie de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et n\u2019est pas utile \u00e0 l\u2019examen. De plus, la question de savoir s\u2019il a re\u00e7u la cl\u00e9 en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019actionnaire n\u2019est pas en cause. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel titre il a re\u00e7u la cl\u00e9.\n[33] Les pr\u00eats d\u2019actionnaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consentis au moyen d\u2019\u00e9critures de journal; des dividendes ou des primes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, puis pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019intervenant croit que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par dividendes; voir la transcription du 8 mars 2023, p. 52 et 53.\n[34] Voir Gestion Yvan Drouin Inc. c. La Reine, 2000 CanLII 407 (CCI) au paragraphe 75.\n[35] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2017, 2018 et 2019, Grant Campbell a gagn\u00e9 plus d\u2019argent au cours de deux de ces ann\u00e9es; toutefois, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e restante, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale de l\u2019intervenant \u00e9tait telle que, pour l\u2019ensemble des trois ann\u00e9es, l\u2019intervenant a gagn\u00e9 environ 67 000 $ de plus que M. Campbell. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019intervenant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de 2020, il est impossible de faire des comparaisons pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Il n\u2019y a pas de donn\u00e9es sur les revenus de M. Campbell avant 2017.\n[36] Voir la transcription de l\u2019audience du 8 mars 2023 aux pages 125 \u00e0 128. Il semble qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le seul propri\u00e9taire employ\u00e9 ayant une telle allocation de d\u00e9penses. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s pouvaient \u00e9galement utiliser de l\u2019\u00e9quipement \u00e0 des fins personnelles, mais pas dans la m\u00eame mesure et pas en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9quipement de tr\u00e8s grande taille; leur utilisation \u00e9tait soumise \u00e0 davantage de contr\u00f4les. Il n\u2019est pas rare qu\u2019on donne plus de latitude aux employ\u00e9s plus anciens.\nDe plus, dans la mesure o\u00f9 on a pu affirmer qu\u2019il y avait eu utilisation au-del\u00e0 de ce qui \u00e9tait permis, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en dehors du contrat de travail.\nIl se peut que l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019\u00e9quipement soit un avantage, auquel cas l\u2019utilisation ne serait pas en cause.\n[37] La preuve visant les billets de voyage et de sport ne permet pas non plus de tirer des conclusions. Malheureusement, bien qu\u2019il y ait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de diff\u00e9rences entre les employ\u00e9s, on ne sait pas exactement dans quelle mesure ces diff\u00e9rences r\u00e9sultent de la promotion des affaires et des relations avec la client\u00e8le. Il n\u2019est pas non plus \u00e9vident de savoir quelles d\u00e9penses sont des avantages sociaux et dans quelle mesure l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait une b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire plut\u00f4t que d\u2019autres.\n[38] Je note que ce n\u2019est pas comme un r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration o\u00f9 il existe un r\u00e9gime de partage du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ou des primes clairement \u00e9tablis en fonction du rendement individuel. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019intervenant est bien corrobor\u00e9e dans la colonne de droite de chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re ligne du tableau de l\u2019annexe A de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel. Ces chiffres sont \u00e9tay\u00e9s par la pi\u00e8ce A2.\n[39] De plus, le fait de recevoir une prime importante sous forme de lotissement dans le contexte o\u00f9 l\u2019appelante a re\u00e7u des paiements en lots pour ses services n\u2019est pas ce qui constituerait un contrat sans lien de d\u00e9pendance.",

Introduction\n[1] Il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saccord quant aux faits. Il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9saccord quant aux chiffres.\n[2] En 2008, l\u2019appelant ach\u00e8te un duplex \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n[3] Il a occup\u00e9 le bas du logement \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sidence principale et il a mis en location \u00e0 des tiers le haut du logement.\n[4] En 2017, l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de louer le logement du haut. Il a effectu\u00e9 des r\u00e9novations afin de transformer le duplex en r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale.\n[5] Suite \u00e0 ces modifications, l\u2019appelant utilisait la r\u00e9sidence unifamiliale \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sidence principale. Il y\u2019a donc eu un changement d\u2019usage en 2017.\n[6] Cette transformation en 2017 a provoqu\u00e9 une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e suite au changement d\u2019usage partiel et, en cons\u00e9quence, un gain en capital et un gain en capital imposable.\n[7] En juin 2018, l\u2019appelant produit sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2017 ; dans cette d\u00e9claration il d\u00e9clare un gain en capital relatif au changement d\u2019usage et il ne fait pas de demande de reporter le gain en capital selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[8] La cotisation initiale du ministre accepte la d\u00e9claration de revenus de l\u2019appelant telle que produite.\n[9] Le 13 novembre 2018, l\u2019appelant signifie un avis d\u2019opposition afin d\u2019exercer son choix selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[10] Le ministre a confirm\u00e9 la cotisation initiale.\n[11] L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que selon le paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il pouvait faire le choix de reporter le gain en capital.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend le contraire. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le choix n\u2019\u00e9tait disponible que s\u2019il y avait un changement d\u2019usage de la totalit\u00e9 du bien, le duplex.\n[13] Il y a eu des amendements au paragraphe 45(3) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu qui sont entr\u00e9s en vigueur apr\u00e8s le 18 mars 2019.\n[14] \u00c0 la fin de 2017 le texte du paragraphe 45(3) \u00e9tait :\n(3) Malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe (1), le contribuable qui cesse \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin n\u2019est pas r\u00e9put\u00e9 en avoir dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et l\u2019avoir acquis de nouveau aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s si le bien devient la r\u00e9sidence principale du contribuable et si le contribuable en fait le choix par avis \u00e9crit au ministre au plus tard au premier en date des jours suivants :\na) le 90e jour suivant l\u2019envoi au contribuable d\u2019une demande formelle du ministre de produire ce choix;\nb) la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition o\u00f9 il a effectivement dispos\u00e9 du bien.\n(Je souligne.)\n[15] Actuellement, le texte du paragraphe 45(3) est :\n(3) Malgr\u00e9 les alin\u00e9as (1)a) et c), si un contribuable cesse totalement ou partiellement \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu un bien qu\u2019il a acquis \u00e0 cette fin, ou en partie \u00e0 cette fin, il n\u2019est pas r\u00e9put\u00e9 en avoir dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et l\u2019avoir acquis de nouveau aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s si le bien devient, en tout ou en partie, la r\u00e9sidence principale du contribuable et si le contribuable en fait le choix par avis \u00e9crit au ministre au plus tard au premier en date des jours suivants :\na) le 90e jour suivant l\u2019envoi au contribuable d\u2019une demande formelle du ministre de produire ce choix ;\nb) la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition o\u00f9 il a effectivement dispos\u00e9 du bien.\n(Je souligne.)\n[16] Si le changement d\u2019usage avait eu lieu apr\u00e8s le 18 mars 2019, il n\u2019y aurait aucun doute que l\u2019appelant aurait pu reporter le gain en capital dont il est question.\n[17] Une cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019Agence de Revenu du Canada est que le contribuable doit payer de l\u2019imp\u00f4t malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a fait aucune vente. Ce qui, selon ses circonstances financi\u00e8res, pourrait lui poser des probl\u00e8mes de liquidit\u00e9s. Cela dit, un probl\u00e8me de liquidit\u00e9 peut arriver dans diverses situations o\u00f9 la Loi cr\u00e9e une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e.\n[18] C\u2019est un r\u00e9sultat un peu surprenant vu qu\u2019un individu qui loue une maison dont il est propri\u00e9taire et qui change d\u2019usage de la maison pour en faire sa r\u00e9sidence principale peut faire le choix et \u00e9viter que cela provoque une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e.[1]\nII. Analyse[2]\n[19] Le fait que la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e avec effet le 18 mars 2019 ne permet pas de tirer de conclusions quant aux droits ant\u00e9rieurs.[3]\n[20] Il est accept\u00e9 que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s\u2019harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble.[4]\n[21] En interpr\u00e9tant le paragraphe 45(3), il est important de consid\u00e9rer le texte de tout l\u2019article 45 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu tel qu\u2019il se lisait \u00e0 la fin de 2017 :\nBien affect\u00e9 \u00e0 plus d\u2019un usage\n45 (1) Les r\u00e8gles suivantes s\u2019appliquent dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente sous-section :\na) un contribuable :\n(i) soit qui a acquis un bien \u00e0 une autre fin et qui commence, \u00e0 un moment post\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 l\u2019utiliser en vue de gagner un revenu\n(ii) soit qui a acquis un bien en vue de gagner un revenu et qui commence, \u00e0 un moment post\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 l\u2019utiliser \u00e0 une autre fin,\nest r\u00e9put\u00e9 :\n(iii) avoir dispos\u00e9 de ce bien \u00e0 ce moment post\u00e9rieur pour un produit \u00e9gal \u00e0 sa juste valeur marchande \u00e0 ce moment\n(iv) avoir, aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s, acquis ce bien de nouveau \u00e0 un co\u00fbt \u00e9gal \u00e0 cette juste valeur marchande;\nb) lorsqu\u2019un bien est, vous vous en vue de gagner un revenu et en partie \u00e0 une autre fin, le contribuable est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir acquis, \u00e0 cette autre fin, la fraction de ce bien repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le rapport entre l\u2019usage qui en est fait habituellement \u00e0 cette autre fin et l\u2019usage total habituel de ce bien, \u00e0 un co\u00fbt, pour lui, \u00e9gal \u00e0 la m\u00eame fraction du co\u00fbt, pour lui, du bien entier;

TRIPLETT,\nappelant,\net\nSA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI,\nintim\u00e9.\n[TRADUCTION FRAN\u00c7AISE OFFICIELLE]\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT\nLe juge Jorr\u00e9\n[1] Les circonstances entourant le pr\u00e9sent appel sont extr\u00eamement malheureuses. \u00c0 la fin des pr\u00e9sents motifs, je formule quelques commentaires sur ces circonstances et j\u2019invite instamment les parties \u00e0 les examiner attentivement.\n[2] Je sugg\u00e8re \u00e9galement aux d\u00e9cideurs d\u2019envisager s\u00e9rieusement la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier les d\u00e9lais pour l\u2019exercice des choix devant \u00eatre faits en vertu de l\u2019article 217 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[3] L\u2019appelant interjette appel des cotisations dat\u00e9es du 26 f\u00e9vrier 2018 et \u00e9tablies relativement aux retenues d\u2019imp\u00f4t des non-r\u00e9sidents pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 et 2015.\n[4] L\u2019appelant est un enseignant \u00e0 la retraite qui a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada jusqu\u2019au 11 octobre 2011. Il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis et est devenu non-r\u00e9sident du Canada.\n[5] En mai et juin 2016, respectivement, le ministre du Revenu national a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant au sujet de d\u00e9clarations T1 non produites pour les ann\u00e9es 2011 \u00e0 2014, inclusivement.\n[6] Le ministre a appris que l\u2019appelant avait chang\u00e9 de lieu de r\u00e9sidence en juin 2016.\n[7] En juillet 2016, l\u2019appelant a produit des d\u00e9clarations de revenus T1 pour toutes les ann\u00e9es en cause et il les a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait encore un r\u00e9sident. Son revenu est compos\u00e9 de prestations de retraite et, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2015 seulement, de certains revenus provenant du REER.\n[8] En mars 2017, le ministre a \u00e9tabli les cotisations pour les cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition pour lesquelles des d\u00e9clarations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es. Aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces cotisations. C\u2019\u00e9tait sans doute en raison de l\u2019imp\u00f4t retenu par les payeurs des r\u00e9gimes de retraite et sur les paiements du REER, en plus des cr\u00e9dits personnels, qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tait payable.\n[9] En f\u00e9vrier 2018, le ministre a \u00e9tabli des cotisations pour versement tardif des retenues d\u2019imp\u00f4t des non-r\u00e9sidents de la partie XIII pour les cinq ann\u00e9es en cause.\n[10] Le montant des cotisations figure dans la colonne de droite du tableau au paragraphe 18 de l\u2019affidavit d\u2019Elaine Armstrong-Kyne.\n[11] Comme on peut le voir dans le tableau, ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s pour chaque ann\u00e9e en d\u00e9terminant la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t applicable des non-r\u00e9sidents[1] sur les paiements de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et en d\u00e9duisant les montants qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 la source. Je d\u00e9signe ces montants retenus comme les \u00ab retenues suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb.\n[12] L\u2019appelant s\u2019est d\u00fbment oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ces cotisations, et le ministre les a ult\u00e9rieurement confirm\u00e9es, sauf pour ce qui est de l\u2019exercice fiscal 2011.\n[13] Pour l\u2019exercice fiscal 2011, le ministre a admis que le contribuable avait r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada jusqu\u2019au mois d\u2019octobre et a recalcul\u00e9 la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t en cons\u00e9quence. Ce nouveau calcul \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019avantage du contribuable dans la mesure o\u00f9 la retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t des non-r\u00e9sidents pour 2011 avait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e pour toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[14] Rien dans la preuve ne m\u2019a convaincu que le ministre avait commis une erreur dans le calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[15] L\u2019objet de l\u2019article 217 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est d\u2019\u00e9viter que certains particuliers non-r\u00e9sidents ne se trouvent dans une posture qui est, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, plus d\u00e9favorable que s\u2019ils \u00e9taient encore r\u00e9sidents.\n[16] Compte tenu des sources de revenus de l\u2019appelant, s\u2019il avait fait le choix au moment opportun de tirer parti de l\u2019option pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 de payer les retenues suppl\u00e9mentaires exig\u00e9es. Ce r\u00e9sultat tient au fait que, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cette option permet au contribuable de conserver les d\u00e9ductions habituelles.\n[17] L\u2019article 217 est facultatif, parce qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9savantageux pour certains contribuables non-r\u00e9sidents de choisir cette option, compte tenu de leur situation.\n[18] Malheureusement, l\u2019article 217 oblige l\u2019appelant \u00e0 produire, dans les six mois suivant la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, une d\u00e9claration de revenus en vertu de la partie I et \u00e0 faire, dans cette d\u00e9claration, le choix pour que l\u2019article 217 s\u2019applique pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e[2].\n[19] Cela signifie que l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb produire sa d\u00e9claration et faire un choix pour la derni\u00e8re des ann\u00e9es en cause, \u00e0 savoir 2015, au plus tard le 30 juin 2016.\n[20] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les d\u00e9clarations pour toutes les ann\u00e9es en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 20 juillet 2016, il \u00e9tait alors d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop tard pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, les cotisations pour ces ann\u00e9es sont correctes en fait et en droit et il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019annuler les cotisations.\n[22] Passons \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant sur les nombreuses difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9es afin d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019information sur la marche \u00e0 suivre et aux arguments qu\u2019il a invoqu\u00e9s qui reposent sur la Charte des droits du contribuable.\n[23] J\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle il a eu de grandes difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 obtenir de l\u2019information, il y avait des retards et l\u2019information fournie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toujours utile.\n[24] Cependant, en d\u00e9pit de son nom, la Charte des droits du contribuable n\u2019est pas une loi et ne conf\u00e8re pas de droits l\u00e9gaux. Ce document repr\u00e9sente plut\u00f4t un id\u00e9al et il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de lui donner un autre nom.\n[25] Notre cour n\u2019exerce qu\u2019une comp\u00e9tence limit\u00e9e et l\u2019essentiel de sa comp\u00e9tence consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les cotisations sont correctes en fonction de faits pertinents \u00e0 la loi applicable; elle peut confirmer ou modifier les cotisations, mais sa d\u00e9cision ne peut pas prendre d\u2019autres facteurs en consid\u00e9ration.\n[26] En cons\u00e9quence, toutes les difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant ne sont pas pertinentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que je dois prendre.\n[27] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 des graves difficult\u00e9s occasionn\u00e9es par les cotisations pour lui et son \u00e9pouse.\n[28] Bien que l\u2019appelant semble se trouver dans une situation extr\u00eamement d\u00e9licate compte tenu du montant exigible par rapport \u00e0 son revenu, je ne peux pas en tenir compte pour les besoins de la d\u00e9cision devant \u00eatre prise.\n[29] Toutefois, pour ce qui est des difficult\u00e9s, il existe des dispositions qui permettent au ministre de renoncer aux int\u00e9r\u00eats et aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s dans certaines circonstances; voir le paragraphe 220(3.1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Je suis heureux de constater que le ministre a renonc\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re proactive aux int\u00e9r\u00eats pour une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e en raison des retards survenus pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\n[30] L\u2019appelant peut certainement demander \u00e0 l\u2019ARC de lui accorder un all\u00e8gement suppl\u00e9mentaire aux termes de cette disposition. Ce tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour traiter ces questions[3].\n[31] Toutefois, une limite de dix ans s\u2019applique pour une remise; les demandes doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les dix ann\u00e9es civiles suivant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. L\u2019appelant peut obtenir d\u2019autres renseignements sur la mani\u00e8re dont le ministre traite ces demandes en consultant la circulaire d\u2019information IC07-1R1 Dispositions d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour les contribuables de l\u2019ARC; le formulaire RC4288 Demande d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour les contribuables contient aussi de l\u2019information.\n[32] Avant de conclure, je voudrais faire remarquer que, compte tenu des objectifs de l\u2019article 217, il est \u00e9tonnant de voir qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 apr\u00e8s le 30 juin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile suivante.\n[33] L\u2019appelant correspond parfaitement au profil du contribuable cens\u00e9 tirer parti de l\u2019article 217.\n[34] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, perdre la possibilit\u00e9 de faire ce choix a eu d\u2019importantes r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives pour l\u2019appelant.\n[35] Les retenues d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es par les payeurs des prestations de retraite de l\u2019appelant et sur les paiements du REER de l\u2019appelant auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes pour couvrir la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de l\u2019appelant s\u2019il avait pu se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019article 217. \u00c0 aucun moment, les fonds publics n\u2019auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 contribution.\n[36] Dans ces conditions, j\u2019ai du mal \u00e0 concevoir quel serait le pr\u00e9judice s\u2019il y avait un moyen de proroger le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 dans des circonstances comme celles de l\u2019appelant[4].\n[37] Ce d\u00e9lai relativement court est aussi surprenant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019un particulier qui omet de r\u00e9clamer quelque chose pourra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement se rattraper en d\u00e9posant une objection. Ce particulier dispose toujours d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019au moins un an \u00e0 compter de la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production[5].\n[38] C\u2019est \u00e9galement \u00e9tonnant, puisque le contribuable peut pour bon nombre de choses tenter de persuader le ministre d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation, avec son consentement, pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix ans[6].\n[39] Les d\u00e9cideurs politiques et le Parlement pourraient examiner s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019apporter des modifications afin d\u2019accorder un d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur pour faire le choix pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 217 ou de donner au ministre la possibilit\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai[7].\n[40] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 22e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024.\n\u00ab G.

Yvon Charbonneau, aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Panneton des sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002 \u00e0 2004, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions qu\u2019il contr\u00f4lait (GAM et PAM, d\u00e9finies ci-apr\u00e8s), alors que M. Charbonneau avait une dette fiscale d\u2019un montant beaucoup plus important.\n[3] Lors de l\u2019audition, seul M. Charbonneau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019appelante. Pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Martin Nadeau, chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e0 la division des oppositions au bureau de Laval de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb), a t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[4] Dans ces motifs, toutes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 une disposition l\u00e9gislative r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Loi, sauf mention contraire.\nII. DISPOSITIONS DE LA LOI\n[5] Les parties pertinentes du paragraphe 160(1) se lisent ainsi:\n160(1) Lorsqu\u2019une personne a, depuis le 1er mai 1951, transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens, directement ou indirectement, au moyen d\u2019une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l\u2019une des personnes suivantes:\na) son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou une personne devenue depuis son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait;\n\u2026\nles r\u00e8gles suivantes s\u2019appliquent :\nd) \u2026;\ne) le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert et l\u2019auteur du transfert sont solidairement responsables du paiement en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi d\u2019un montant \u00e9gal au moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 des montants suivants :\n(i) l\u2019exc\u00e9dent \u00e9ventuel de la juste valeur marchande des biens au moment du transfert sur la juste valeur marchande \u00e0 ce moment de la contrepartie donn\u00e9e pour le bien,\n\u2026\n160(1) Where a person has, on or after May 1, 1951, transferred property, either directly or indirectly, by means of a trust or by any other means whatever, to\n(a) the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner or a person who has since become the person\u2019s spouse or common-law partner,\n\u2026\nthe following rules apply:\n(d) \u2026,\n(e) the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the property at the time it was transferred exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given for the property,\n\u2026\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE ET CONCESSIONS DES PARTIES\n[6] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 30 novembre 2023 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour, et confirm\u00e9e par les parties au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, les parties ont indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour que la seule question que la Cour doit trancher est la suivante :\nEst-ce que M. Charbonneau, le d\u00e9biteur fiscal, a transf\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00ab directement ou indirectement, au moyen d\u2019une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb, la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1) ?\n[7] Les parties ont convenu que les autres conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) sont remplies (voir La Reine c. Livingston 2008 CAF 89 [Livingston] (au par. 17):\ni)M. Charbonneau a une dette fiscale d\u2019un montant au moins \u00e9gal \u00e0 la somme de 141 109,38 $ au moment des transferts s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant de 2002 \u00e0 2004;\nii)La b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des transferts, soit Mme Panneton, est la conjointe de M. Charbonneau tout au long de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant de 2002 \u00e0 2004, et l\u2019est encore en date de l\u2019audience;\niii)La juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s totalisant 141 109,38 $ exc\u00e8de la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie donn\u00e9e par Mme Panneton, soit la somme de 9 800 $.\nIV. CONCLUSION ET DISPOSITIF\n[8] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1). Ainsi, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s selon le tarif B de l\u2019annexe II des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale).\nV. FAITS\n5.1 T\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau\nGAM\n[9] En 1995, M. Charbonneau a constitu\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 9029-4802 Qu\u00e9bec inc., faisant affaire, entre autres, sous le nom Groupe Action Motivation (\u00ab GAM \u00bb).\n[10] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2008, les administrateurs de GAM \u00e9taient M. Charbonneau et Mme Panneton, Mme Panneton \u00e9tait la secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re et M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident.\n[11] Jusqu\u2019en 2009, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait le seul actionnaire de GAM. En 2009, Mme Panneton a acquis les actions d\u00e9tenues alors par M. Charbonneau dans le capital de GAM.\n[12] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2008, GAM offrait environ 150 \u00e0 200 formations en entreprise par ann\u00e9e (incluant du mentorat et des conf\u00e9rences), n\u2019avait pas d\u2019employ\u00e9 et engageait environ 23 pigistes par ann\u00e9e. M. Charbonneau veillait au bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019organisation ; plus particuli\u00e8rement, il s\u2019occupait de la livraison des mandats, du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires et du contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des services. Quant \u00e0 Mme Panneton, elle s\u2019occupait des t\u00e2ches de secr\u00e9tariat, faisait des constats quant \u00e0 la livraison de la formation et conseillait l\u2019organisation, sans toutefois recevoir de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de GAM.\n[13] La client\u00e8le de GAM \u00e9tait panqu\u00e9b\u00e9coise ; les sources de revenus de GAM provenaient des services de mentorat et de formation en entreprise. Les sommes factur\u00e9es aux clients en paiement des services rendus \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au compte bancaire de GAM, et non pas au compte bancaire personnel de M. Charbonneau.\n[14] Selon M. Charbonneau, GAM aurait encouru les d\u00e9penses pour les fins suivantes dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise: le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires, les voyages et d\u00e9placements, les loyers, la bureautique et papeterie, et les am\u00e9liorations locatives du local situ\u00e9 au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence dont Mme Panneton \u00e9tait la seule propri\u00e9taire (la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb). M. Charbonneau habitait \u00e9galement la r\u00e9sidence.\nPAM\n[15] En 1998, M. Charbonneau a constitu\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Productions Action Motivation inc. (\u00ab PAM \u00bb). PAM a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise sur pied en vue de faire la production de vid\u00e9os sur la motivation.\n[16] Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, vers 2004, PAM aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour recruter des investisseurs, cr\u00e9er un club d\u2019investissement et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des placements boursiers. Ainsi, un certain M. Andr\u00e9 Cloutier se serait joint \u00e0 PAM pour recruter des investisseurs.\n[17] Selon M. Charbonneau, M. Cloutier aurait occup\u00e9 un bureau situ\u00e9 dans le sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, ni M. Charbonneau ni Mme Panneton n\u2019exer\u00e7aient de fonctions aupr\u00e8s de PAM, sauf pour M. Charbonneau qui viellait \u00e0 d\u00e9poser les contributions re\u00e7ues des investisseurs au compte bancaire de PAM.\n[18] Selon les d\u00e9clarations annuelles de PAM pour les ann\u00e9es 2001 et 2002, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire et administrateur. Selon la d\u00e9claration annuelle pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, M. Cloutier \u00e9tait actionnaire, administrateur et vice-pr\u00e9sident, et M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait actionnaire, administrateur et pr\u00e9sident.\n[19] Toutefois, selon M. Charbonneau, M. Cloutier ne serait devenu actionnaire de PAM que vers l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004, puisqu\u2019en 2003, M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire et administrateur.\n[20] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 et 2004, PAM n\u2019aurait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 aucun revenu mais aurait encouru les d\u00e9penses pour les fins suivantes dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise: les loyers, les voyages d\u2019affaires, la bureautique et les am\u00e9liorations locatives du local situ\u00e9 au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence de Mme Panneton.\nLa r\u00e9sidence et les travaux\n[21] La r\u00e9sidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par Mme Panneton en mai 2002 au prix de 215 000 $. Les travaux y auraient d\u00e9but\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003.\n[22] M. Charbonneau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tendue des am\u00e9liorations locatives qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence : l\u2019installation d\u2019une salle d\u2019eau, de planchers et de cloisons au sous-sol, ainsi que la construction d\u2019une salle de formation au garage et l\u2019\u00e9largissement du stationnement pour quatre \u00e0 six voitures.\n[23] \u00c9galement, selon M. Charbonneau, des d\u00e9penses auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues pour l\u2019am\u00e9nagement d\u2019un pavillon de jardin situ\u00e9 sur le terrain de la r\u00e9sidence pour y tenir des r\u00e9unions professionnelles.\n5.2 T\u00e9moignage de M. Nadeau\n[24] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002, 2003 et 2004, M. Charbonneau ne d\u00e9tenait aucun compte bancaire en son nom personnel.\n[25] Selon l\u2019imprim\u00e9 \u00ab option C \u00bb de l\u2019ARC concernant M. Charbonneau, ce dernier aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un revenu d\u2019entreprise de 23 930 $ en 2002, et aucun revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2007 (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 6, Copie de l\u2019imprim\u00e9 \u00ab Option C \u00bb de l\u2019ARC pour M. Charbonneau, relatif aux ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002 \u00e0 2007 [en liasse]).\n[26] Vers l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2009, l\u2019ARC a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de M. Charbonneau au niveau personnel pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002 \u00e0 2007. Suite \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification, l\u2019ARC a \u00e9tabli une cotisation par la m\u00e9thode de l\u2019avoir net (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 7 : rapport de v\u00e9rification de M. L\u00e9tourneau (ARC) pour la cotisation sous-jacente).\n[27] Suite \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification, un montant total de 1 280 532 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Charbonneau pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2004, alors qu\u2019un montant total de 70 503 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Charbonneau pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2007.\n[28] Les montants des retraits bancaires au compte de PAM totalisant 1 176 342 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s au revenu de M. Charbonneau selon le paragraphe 15(1).\n[29] Selon M. Nadeau, des sommes totalisant 1,5 M$ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au compte bancaire de PAM, et en sont ressorties. Puisqu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces sommes provenaient d\u2019une personne autre que M. Charbonneau, ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 sur ces sommes.\n[30] Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, M. Nadeau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que certaines sommes provenaient probablement des investisseurs. M. Charbonneau s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 aux cotisations, et a fait faillite en d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n[31] En ce qui concerne la cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Panneton, M. Nadeau indique que les motifs d\u2019opposition \u00e9taient que les sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Panneton ne provenaient pas de M. Charbonneau et que certains montants avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9s sous le paragraphe 15(1).\n[32] Toutefois, selon M. Nadeau, les montants cotis\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 15(1) ne provenaient ni de GAM ni de PAM, mais d\u2019une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nVI. TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES\n6.1 La th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelante [33] Selon l\u2019appelante, un appauvrissement du patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur fiscal est essentiel pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un transfert aux fins de l\u2019article 160.\n[34] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y aurait eu aucun transfert direct ou indirect de biens provenant du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 celui de Mme Panneton, puisque ce sont les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, et non pas M. Charbonneau, qui ont transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes provenant de leurs fonds propres au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, aux fins de la construction d\u2019am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence.\n[35] Compte tenu que PAM et GAM ne sont pas des d\u00e9bitrices fiscales, Mme Panneton ne peut donc \u00eatre tenue responsable des dettes fiscales de son conjoint, M. Charbonneau. En outre, on ne pourrait conclure qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de quelques biens que ce soit du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau au patrimoine de Mme Panneton, puisque le patrimoine de M. Charbonneau ne se serait pas appauvri par l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques par PAM et GAM au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton.\n[36] \u00c9galement, au soutien de sa th\u00e8se, l\u2019appelante indique que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM sont des personnes morales ayant un patrimoine distinct de celui de M. Charbonneau, qui ont la pleine jouissance de leurs droits civils (articles 301 et suivants du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, RLRQ c. CCQ-1991 (\u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb)).\n[37] De plus, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu un transfert indirect de la somme de 141 109,38 $ de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton, puisque M. Charbonneau n\u2019a pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ces sommes \u00e0 PAM et GAM, pour qu\u2019ensuite PAM et GAM les transf\u00e8rent \u00e0 Mme Panneton. En effet, selon l\u2019appelante, la preuve aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que PAM et GAM avaient des sources de revenus qui leur \u00e9taient propres.\n[38] Finalement, il serait contradictoire pour le ministre d\u2019avoir cotis\u00e9 M. Charbonneau pour appropriation de fonds provenant de PAM et GAM en vertu du paragraphe 15(1), pour maintenant pr\u00e9tendre que les fonds aux comptes bancaires de PAM et GAM constituent des fonds propres \u00e0 M. Charbonneau.\n6.2 La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[39] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il y aurait eu transfert direct ou indirect de biens de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1), de sorte que Mme Panneton est responsable des dettes fiscales de M. Charbonneau conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre. Pour appuyer sa th\u00e8se, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soumis deux th\u00e9ories \u00e0 la Cour.\n[40] Selon la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en utilisant les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, M. Charbonneau aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton (ou pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice) provenant de ses propres fonds, ce qui fait en sorte qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens aux fins du paragraphe 160(1).\n[41] Les faits suivants supporteraient cette conclusion.\n[42] Tout d\u2019abord, PAM et GAM n\u2019ont exerc\u00e9 aucune activit\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2001 jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 2004.\n[43] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que PAM n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu et n\u2019a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9pense au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2003. Quant \u00e0 GAM, elle a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 peu de revenus. M. Charbonneau n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2007.\n[44] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les suppos\u00e9es am\u00e9liorations locatives apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une entreprise exploit\u00e9e par GAM et PAM, puisque les paiements faits par GAM et PAM auraient servi \u00e0 r\u00e9nover la r\u00e9sidence.\n[45] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau est parfois vague, contradictoire et int\u00e9ress\u00e9, et n\u2019est donc pas cr\u00e9dible. L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande \u00e0 la Cour de tirer une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative de l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton et de M. Cloutier \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des divers ch\u00e8ques ne supporte pas la th\u00e8se de l\u2019appelante.\n[47] Finalement, la preuve aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau ne d\u00e9tenait aucun compte bancaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des transferts, soit entre 2002 et 2004. Il \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de GAM et l\u2019actionnaire unique ou majoritaire de PAM. Il avait le contr\u00f4le des deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, ainsi que des comptes bancaires de celles-ci. Il est donc fort probable qu\u2019il utilisait les comptes bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait ses comptes bancaires personnels.\n[48] Toutefois, si la Cour n\u2019est pas convaincue par la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que M. Charbonneau a effectu\u00e9 un transfert de la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement \u2026de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[49] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Charbonneau aurait pris des dispositions pour que PAM et GAM fassent des paiements aux tiers pour la r\u00e9novation de la r\u00e9sidence, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton. Il faut donc conclure que le patrimoine de M. Charbonneau s\u2019est appauvri de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[50] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour doit appliquer les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s des affaires Canada c. Kieboom [1992] 3 C.F. 488 (CAF) [Kieboom] et Strachan c. La Reine, 2013 CCI 362 [Strachan].\nVII. DISCUSSION\n7.1 Transfert au sens du paragraphe 160(1) : la jurisprudence pertinente\n[51] Selon la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54 [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601 [Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco] (au par. 10) :\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur une analyse textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9gager un sens qui s\u2019harmonise avec la Loi dans son ensemble.\n[52] Dans ce m\u00eame arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rappel\u00e9 que la complexit\u00e9 de certaines dispositions de la Loi devait inciter les tribunaux \u00e0 accorder une importance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation textuelle, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer l\u2019uniformit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 requises pour les contribuables (Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco, aux par. 11 et 12).\n[53] L\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) \u00ab \u2026 d\u00e9pend dans une mesure particuli\u00e8rement importante de l\u2019objet\u2026 \u00bb de ce paragraphe, qui est \u00ab \u2026 d\u2019emp\u00eacher un contribuable de transf\u00e9rer ses biens \u00e0 son conjoint \u2026 afin de faire \u00e9chec aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le ministre pour percevoir l\u2019argent qui lui est d\u00fb \u00bb (voir Livingston, au par. 18, citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland c. Canada, 98 DTC 6358 (CAF) [Medland]).\n[54] R\u00e9cemment, dans Eyeball Networks Inc. c. La Reine, 2021 CAF 17 (au par. 60), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rappel\u00e9 l\u2019objet du paragraphe 160(1) :\n[44] Comme le confirme notre Cour, le paragraphe 160(1) a pour objet de supprimer pour le fisc toute vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un transfert de biens entre personnes ayant un lien de d\u00e9pendance fond\u00e9 sur une contrepartie inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u2026\n[55] Comme le d\u00e9montre la jurisprudence mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessous, une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de cette disposition est de mise, permettant de respecter l\u2019objet de celle-ci, de m\u00eame que le texte de la disposition et le contexte de la Loi.\n[56] Tout d\u2019abord, le paragraphe 160(1) est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans des termes tr\u00e8s larges. Ce paragraphe vise toutes situations o\u00f9, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, un d\u00e9biteur fiscal transf\u00e8re des biens \u00e0 son conjoint (ou autres personnes vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 160(1)), si ce transfert venait \u00ab faire \u00e9chec aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le ministre pour percevoir l'argent qui lui est d\u00fb \u00bb (voir Livingston, au par. 18, citant Medland).\n[57] L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u00ab directement ou indirectement, au moyen d\u2019une fiducie ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb indique \u00e9galement cette volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019inclure un vaste \u00e9ventail de transactions \u00e0 la port\u00e9e d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur fiscal pour transf\u00e9rer des biens \u00e0 une autre personne vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1).\n[58] En outre, la version fran\u00e7aise du paragraphe 160(1) emploie l\u2019expression \u00ab [l]orsqu\u2019une personne a\u2026 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens\u2026 \u00bb, et non pas \u00ab des biens lui appartenant \u00bb. La terminologie utilis\u00e9e indique qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019exigence que le conjoint (ou l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des personnes vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 160(1)) re\u00e7oive les m\u00eames biens que ceux qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le d\u00e9biteur fiscal. La version anglaise du paragraphe 160(1) utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab [w]here a person has \u2026 transferred property\u2026 \u00bb qui est au m\u00eame effet.\n[59] La Cour en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion \u00e9galement en consid\u00e9rant d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi qui emploie un langage diff\u00e9rent de celui utilis\u00e9 aux fins du paragraphe 160(1). Par exemple, pour le calcul du gain en capital provenant de la disposition d\u2019un bien, le paragraphe 39(1) pr\u00e9voit que pour les fins de la Loi, le gain en capital \u00e0 inclure dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019un contribuable doit provenir de la disposition \u00ab d\u2019un bien lui appartenant \u00bb. La version anglaise du paragraphe 39(1) utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab any property of the taxpayer \u00bb. Pour ce qui est de la valeur des biens \u00e0 inclure \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire aux fins de la Loi, il est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 que ce sera leur co\u00fbt d\u2019acquisition pour le contribuable (en anglais, on utilise l\u2019expression \u00ab cost at which the taxpayer acquired the property \u00bb.)\n[60] \u00c9galement, la jurisprudence a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb de fa\u00e7on large (voir Damis Properties Inc. c. La Reine, 2021 CCI 24 [Damis Properties], aux par. 119 \u00e0 131, d\u00e9cision renvers\u00e9e en appel, mais pas sur ce point, voir Canada c. Microbjo Properties Inc., 2023 CAF 157). Ainsi, dans Damis Properties, pour conclure de cette fa\u00e7on, la Cour a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb retrouv\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat David Fasken Estate c. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] Ex CR 580 (aux pages 591-592) [Fasken Estate].\n[61] Les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de Fasken Estate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Kieboom qui devait d\u00e9terminer le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab \u2026a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens, directement ou indirectement, par un acte de fiducie ou par tout autre moyen\u2026 \u00bb, dans le cadre de l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles d\u2019attribution pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi, soit une expression tr\u00e8s similaire \u00e0 celle retrouv\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1).\n[62] Dans cette affaire, M. Kieboom avait fait en sorte que sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mette des actions \u00e0 sa conjointe pour une contrepartie inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande, faisant diminuer sa propre participation au capital de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu un transfert indirect par M. Kieboom \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse :\n18 \u2026A mon avis, l'expression \u00ab transfert de biens \u00bb est employ\u00e9e dans cette disposition dans un sens plut\u00f4t large. Les deux substantifs de cette expression sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et n'ont pas de sens technique. Quant au mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb, le lord juge James a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 7 de l'arr\u00eat Gathercole v. Smith (1880-81), 17 Ch. D. 1 (C.A.) que le substantif \u00ab transfert \u00bb est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab l\u2019un des termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que l'on puisse employer \u00bb. Le lord juge Lush a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [\u00e0 la page 9] que le mot \u00ab transf\u00e9rable \u00bb comprend [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tout moyen par lequel un bien peut \u00eatre transmis d'une personne \u00e0 une autre \u00bb.\n19 Le pr\u00e9sident Thorson, se fondant sur les d\u00e9finitions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es dans le jugement Fasken, David v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] R.C.\u00c9. 580, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 592:\n[TRADUCTION] Le mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb n'est pas un terme technique. Pour qu'il y ait transfert d'un bien d'un mari \u00e0 sa femme, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il soit fait selon une forme particuli\u00e8re, ni qu'il soit fait directement. Il suffit que le contribuable se d\u00e9partisse du bien et le remette \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il lui transmette le bien. Le moyen employ\u00e9 pour atteindre ce r\u00e9sultat, qu'il soit direct ou indirect, peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre appel\u00e9 un transfert.\n...\n21 Ainsi donc, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le contribuable a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 un bien \u00e0 sa femme en lui donnant une partie de sa participation dans sa compagnie. La participation de 40 % du capital-actions de sa compagnie qu'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme constituait de toute \u00e9vidence un bien. Sa participation dans sa compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite de 40 % et celle de sa femme a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e de 40 %. Le fait qu'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ce transfert de bien en faisant \u00e9mettre des actions par sa compagnie ne fait pas de diff\u00e9rence. Le paragraphe 74(1) s'applique aux transferts qui sont faits \u00ab directement ou indirectement \u00bb ou \u00ab par tout autre moyen que ce soit \u00bb. Le transfert, qui en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait indirect, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le contribuable a pris des dispositions pour que sa compagnie \u00e9mette des actions \u00e0 sa femme, constitue n\u00e9anmoins un transfert du mari \u00e0 la femme. \u2026\n[mes soulignements]\n[63] Dans Medland, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la question \u00e0 savoir si un particulier avait effectu\u00e9 un transfert \u00e0 sa conjointe au sens du paragraphe 160(1) en effectuant des remboursements de capital \u00e0 la banque \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une dette garantie par une hypoth\u00e8que grevant la r\u00e9sidence appartenant \u00e0 sa conjointe. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu transfert indirect au sens du paragraphe 160(1) :\n[15] Je suis d'avis que le juge de la Cour de l'imp\u00f4t a eu raison de conclure que l'\u00e9poux de la demanderesse lui a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens indirectement en ce qui concerne la partie des paiements hypoth\u00e9caires imputables au principal de l'emprunt.\n[16] Le terme \" biens \" figurant dans le paragraphe 160(1) de la Loi, d\u00e9fini comme des \" biens de toute nature \", y compris \" de l'argent \", a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par lord Langdale9 comme [Traduction] \" celui des termes pouvant \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s qui est le plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en ce qu'il indique et d\u00e9crit toute la gamme possible d'int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'une partie peut avoir.\"\n[17] Le terme \" transfert \" n'est pas d\u00e9fini dans la loi. Il a fait l'objet des remarques suivantes de la part du pr\u00e9sident Thorson de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada dans Estate of Fasken v. M.N.R.10\u2026\n\u2026\n[19] En appliquant l'expression [Traduction] \" transfert ... de biens \" du paragraphe 4(4) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t de guerre sur le revenu de 1917 \u00e0 ces faits, le juge Thorson a indiqu\u00e9 en fait que, contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse en l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, lorsque le mari se d\u00e9partit d'un bien particulier, que ce m\u00eame bien soit d\u00e9volu \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse.\n[20] Les termes \" indirectement ... de toute autre fa\u00e7on \" figurant dans le paragraphe 160(1) de la Loi renvoient \u00e0 toute fa\u00e7on d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e dont un bien de quelque nature peut \u00eatre transmis d'une personne \u00e0 une autre. En l'esp\u00e8ce, lorsque M. Medland a effectu\u00e9 les paiements au cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, il a indiqu\u00e9 que cet argent devait \u00eatre imput\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de l'emprunt hypoth\u00e9caire grevant le bien sur lequel il n'avait plus d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Bien qu'il soit exact que le paragraphe 160(1) n'emploie pas les mots \" au profit de \" ni \" au nom de \" comme les paragraphes 15(1) ou 74.1(1) ou l'alin\u00e9a 224(1.1) de la Loi, la demanderesse ne nie pas que sa dette a diminu\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce aux paiements et que la valeur nette de son bien a augment\u00e9. La fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ce r\u00e9sultat consistait \u00e0 verser des montants \u00e0 la Banque que celle-ci imputait \u00e0 un emprunt hypoth\u00e9caire grevant une maison dont la demanderesse \u00e9tait l'unique propri\u00e9taire. Le paiement \u00e0 la Banque n'\u00e9tait qu'un moyen pour transmettre les fonds indirectement du mari \u00e0 la demanderesse.\n[21] L\u2019argument de la demanderesse portant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu transfert de biens parce que M. Medland s\u2019est d\u00e9parti d\u2019argent et que ces sommes n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es [physiquement] \u00e0 la demanderesse est sans fondement. [...]\n[mes soulignements]\n[64] Dans Strachan, la Cour devait d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019article 160 s\u2019appliquait aux transactions par lesquelles M. Strachan avait permis \u00e0 sa conjointe de souscrire \u00e0 des actions d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il avait la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une valeur moindre que la valeur marchande. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 avec approbation aux conclusions de Kieboom, la Cour a conclu ainsi:\n[38] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Strachan a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019une fa\u00e7on semblable : il lui a d\u2019abord donn\u00e9 95 p. 100, puis 98 p. 100, de sa participation au capital de Northside en lui permettant de souscrire 38 actions pour la somme de 38 000 $, puis 75 actions pour la somme de 75 000 $, en 2001 et en 2002 respectivement. J\u2019ai conclu que M. Strachan \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de Northside avant le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2004. Il a donc renonc\u00e9 aux droits se rattachant \u00e0 ses actions dans une m\u00eame proportion (c.-\u00e0-d. son droit de vote en tant qu\u2019actionnaire unique, son droit de recevoir 100 p. 100 des dividendes en cas de distribution et son droit de recevoir la totalit\u00e9 des biens restants de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en cas de dissolution). Le fait que M. Strachan a fait transf\u00e9rer les actions \u00e0 l\u2019appelante en faisant en sorte que Northside les \u00e9mette ne devrait faire aucune diff\u00e9rence.\n[65] Finalement, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence traitant du terme \u00ab transfert \u00bb et les d\u00e9cisions traitant du paragraphe 160(1), dont Kieboom et Medland, la Cour, dans l\u2019affaire Damis Properties, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on fort juste et appropri\u00e9e le droit applicable eu \u00e9gard au paragraphe 160(1):\n[130] Tout d\u2019abord, la Cour constate que M. Kieboom a \u00ab pris des dispositions \u00bb pour que les op\u00e9rations constituent le transfert du bien de lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 et non d\u2019une condition dans le pr\u00e9ambule. Les mots \u00ab une personne a : [...] transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens [. . .] \u00bb appelant (sic) une d\u00e9termination objective de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Ces mots n\u2019exigent pas de d\u00e9terminer qui a provoqu\u00e9 ce qui s\u2019est produit.\n[131] Ensuite, la Cour rejette la classification \u00e9troite des biens en cause par M. Kieboom comme \u00e9tant des actions particuli\u00e8res de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cela m\u2019indique que plut\u00f4t que de tenter de retracer un bien particulier, il faut consid\u00e9rer toutes les circonstances et d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du bien d\u2019une personne et l\u2019augmentation du bien d\u2019une autre personne. Telle est l\u2019approche consacr\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision Kieboom et par l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland.\n[mes soulignements]\n[66] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, au regard de la jurisprudence, pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un transfert selon le paragraphe 160(1), la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton.\n7.2 Transfert fait \u00ab indirectement \u2026de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb par M. Charbonneau \u00e0 Mme Panneton, au sens du paragraphe 160(1) [67] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par les parties qu\u2019entre le 4 novembre 2002 et le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, GAM a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques de son compte bancaire de la caisse populaire Desjardins de La Prairie (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 22, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de GAM [en liasse]) totalisant 83 392,27 $, en paiement \u00e0 des tiers pour divers biens et services.\n[68] Il n\u2019est \u00e9galement pas contest\u00e9 par les parties qu\u2019entre le 1er mars 2003 et le 16 janvier 2004, PAM a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques de son compte bancaire de la caisse populaire de St-Lambert (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 16, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de PAM [en liasse]) totalisant 57 717,11 $, en paiement \u00e0 des tiers pour divers biens et services.\n[69] De plus, l\u2019appelante convient que les paiements faits aux tiers par GAM, totalisant 83 392,27 $, et par PAM, totalisant 57 717,11 $, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, puisque les paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en contrepartie de travaux effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence appartenant \u00e0 Mme Panneton en part enti\u00e8re.\n[70] Ainsi, les parties conviennent qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton. Ce principe d\u00e9coule de l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland (aux par. 20-21), principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 par notre Cour dans Goldberg c. La Reine, 2003 DTC 190 (CCI) (au par. 14).\n[71] La Cour doit donc d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ de M. Charbonneau, le d\u00e9biteur fiscal, \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[72] En appliquant les principes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par la jurisprudence, pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb la somme de 141 109,38 $ \u00e0 Mme Panneton, sa conjointe, au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[73] En effet, en examinant toutes les circonstances entourant les transactions, la Cour conclut, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton. Cons\u00e9quemment, et vu les concessions faites par les parties, toutes les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) sont remplies en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[74] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que GAM et PAM n\u2019ont re\u00e7u aucune contrepartie en \u00e9change des paiements faits aux tiers totalisant 141 109,38 $.\n[75] La Cour ne retient pas la version des faits de M. Charbonneau \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les sommes vers\u00e9es par GAM et PAM ont servi \u00e0 payer pour des am\u00e9liorations locatives apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de GAM et PAM qui y exer\u00e7aient leurs activit\u00e9s.\n[76] La Cour conclut plut\u00f4t que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton. De plus, puisque les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9 des paiements \u00e0 des tiers totalisant 141 109,38 $ sans recevoir la moindre contrepartie, il est donc appropri\u00e9 pour la Cour de conclure que le patrimoine de GAM et PAM a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalent et d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que la valeur des actions de GAM et PAM d\u00e9tenues par l\u2019actionnaire unique, M. Charbonneau, a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalant.\n[77] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 par notre Cour dans Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage s\u2019\u00e9value de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[23] En mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je peux tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses que comporte le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins, y compris les incoh\u00e9rences internes (si le t\u00e9moignage change pendant que le t\u00e9moin est \u00e0 la barre ou s'il diverge du t\u00e9moignage rendu \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable), les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences externes (soit lorsque le t\u00e9moignage est incompatible avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ind\u00e9pendants que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9s). Il m\u2019est ensuite loisible d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attitude et le comportement du t\u00e9moin. Troisi\u00e8mement, je peux rechercher si le t\u00e9moin a des raisons de rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur. Enfin, je peux prendre en compte la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve. C\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que j\u2019ai toute latitude pour rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[78] Ainsi, pour \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, la Cour peut tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences, des faiblesses du t\u00e9moignage, de m\u00eame que l\u2019attitude du t\u00e9moin, et peut rechercher si le t\u00e9moin aurait des raisons d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur, et consid\u00e9rer la teneur de la preuve. La Cour peut accepter la totalit\u00e9, une partie ou seulement certaines parties du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, ou totalement rejeter le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin (voir Ha c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 271, au par. 21).\n[79] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Charbonneau au sujet des am\u00e9liorations locatives est peu cr\u00e9dible, puisqu\u2019entre autres, cet argument n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 avant l\u2019audition de cet appel. Cet argument n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 au cours des discussions avec l\u2019ARC, ainsi qu\u2019au cours du processus d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation en appel devant cette Cour. L\u2019avis d\u2019opposition d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve (pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 2, Copie de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition de l\u2019appelante pour la cotisation portant le num\u00e9ro 4870340) ne mentionne aucunement l\u2019existence de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives.\n[80] \u00c9galement, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel log\u00e9 par Mme Panneton n\u2019en fait aucunement mention. L\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re qu\u2019aux paiements effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 des tiers par GAM, en pr\u00e9cisant que les ch\u00e8ques \u00ab \u2026 correspondent \u00e0 des sommes que l\u2019appelante s\u2019est elle-m\u00eame vers\u00e9e via sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en raison des sommes qui lui \u00e9taient alors dues par cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (voir le par. 10 de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour le 28 mars 2019). L\u2019avis d\u2019appel ne fait aucune mention de PAM.\n[81] \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour tire une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative de l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton \u00e0 l\u2019audition de son appel devant la Cour et conclut que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019aurait pas aid\u00e9 sa cause ou aurait m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de M. Charbonneau (voir Imperial Pacific Greenhouses Ltd. c. La Reine, 2011 CAF 79, au par. 14).\n[82] L\u2019appelante a tent\u00e9 de justifier l\u2019absence de Mme Panneton \u00e0 l\u2019audition de son appel pour le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audition consid\u00e9rant que la seule question en litige \u00e9tait de savoir si M. Charbonneau avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens \u00e0 celle-ci. La Cour consid\u00e8re cette justification tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9e et ne la retient pas, et en tire donc une inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Panneton aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fort utile pour permettre \u00e0 la Cour de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue des travaux effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, \u00e0 savoir si des am\u00e9liorations locatives avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es au sous-sol de la r\u00e9sidence ou encore, si des r\u00e9novations importantes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence.\n[83] De plus, M. Charbonneau n\u2019a fourni aucun \u00e9tat financier d\u00e9montrant l\u2019existence de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de GAM et PAM.\n[84] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve une copie du registre Cortax maintenu par l\u2019ARC reprenant la d\u00e9claration de revenus et les annexes de GAM pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant les 31 janvier 2003 et 31 janvier 2004 (voir les pi\u00e8ces I- 1, Cortax pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 et I-2, Cortax pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004). Le bilan n\u2019indique aucune immobilisation au titre des am\u00e9liorations locatives, les seules immobilisations y apparaissant \u00e9tant le mat\u00e9riel informatique et les logiciels (co\u00fbt : 14 388 $), de m\u00eame que les machines, meubles et accessoires (co\u00fbt : 1 449 $).\n[85] En ce qui concerne PAM, elle n\u2019a pas produit de d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2002, 2003 et 2004, comme elle devait le faire. Ce n\u2019est que dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification de M. Charbonneau ayant d\u00e9but\u00e9 vers 2009 que les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de PAM pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2004 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites par M. Charbonneau. PAM n\u2019a produit aucun bilan, n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu et n\u2019a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9pense.\n[86] Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 facile pour M. Charbonneau, contr\u00f4lant les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, de produire de tels documents. La Cour en vient donc \u00e0 la conclusion que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, de telles am\u00e9liorations locatives n\u2019existent pas et les paiements aux tiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s par PAM et GAM pour la r\u00e9novation de la r\u00e9sidence.\n[87] En effet, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. La r\u00e9sidence a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise en mai 2002 \u00e0 un prix de 215 000 $ et des sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es \u00e0 des tiers par GAM et PAM pour les travaux apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. Compte tenu des montants en jeu, il est plus probable que des r\u00e9novations importantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, plut\u00f4t que des am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol pour les activit\u00e9s de GAM et PAM.\n[88] \u00c9galement, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de certains tiers b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des paiements soul\u00e8ve des doutes quant \u00e0 la nature des d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es. Cela semble plut\u00f4t indiquer que des r\u00e9novations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, et non pas des am\u00e9liorations locatives au sous-sol de celle-ci pour les fins de l\u2019entreprise de PAM et GAM. Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, la Cour a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par exemple les paiements faits aux personnes tierces suivantes : Club piscine, C\u00e8dres experts, Sensation musicale Hi-Fi, \u00c9b\u00e9nisterie S.R. inc., et Cr\u00e9ations de L\u00e9gance inc. (voir pi\u00e8ce A-1, onglet 22, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de GAM [en liasse] et onglet 16, Copie de ch\u00e8ques de PAM [en liasse]).\n[89] En outre, pour les motifs suivants, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s GAM et PAM tout au long de la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9mis les ch\u00e8ques et effectu\u00e9 les paiements aux tiers, sans recevoir aucune contrepartie.\n[90] Ainsi, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, suite \u00e0 ces op\u00e9rations, il est donc appropri\u00e9 pour la Cour d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que la valeur des actions de GAM et PAM d\u00e9tenues par l\u2019actionnaire unique, M. Charbonneau, a diminu\u00e9 d\u2019un montant \u00e9quivalant, et que M. Charbonneau s\u2019est donc d\u00e9parti de biens d\u2019une valeur totalisant 141 109,38 $.\n[91] En effet, en ce qui concerne GAM, l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques et les paiements aux tiers s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur la p\u00e9riode du 4 novembre 2002 au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de GAM de 1995 (moment de la constitution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9) jusqu\u2019en 2009.\n[92] En ce qui concerne PAM, l\u2019\u00e9mission des ch\u00e8ques et les paiements aux tiers s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur la p\u00e9riode du 1er mars 2003 au 16 janvier 2004. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Charbonneau \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de PAM au cours des ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2003, incluant le mois de janvier 2004. Il est plus probable que M. Cloutier ne soit devenu actionnaire de PAM qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le mois de janvier 2004, soit apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis par PAM et les paiements aux tiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s. Tout d\u2019abord, M. Charbonneau a lui-m\u00eame t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Cloutier n\u2019\u00e9tait devenu actionnaire de PAM que vers 2004. En outre, il est plus probable que M. Cloutier n\u2019aurait pas permis que PAM \u00e9mette des ch\u00e8ques en paiement de biens ou services au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mme Panneton, sans contrepartie.\n[93] De plus, la valeur du patrimoine de Mme Panneton s\u2019est accrue d\u2019autant, puisque Mme Panneton n\u2019a vers\u00e9 aucune contrepartie pour les sommes totalisant 141 109,38 $ pay\u00e9es par GAM et PAM aux tiers, \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice (sauf en ce qui concerne les loyers totalisant 9 800 $, tel qu\u2019admis par l\u2019intim\u00e9), et celle-ci a donc re\u00e7u un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e9quivalant.\n[94] Si de tels paiements n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s GAM et PAM, le fisc aurait pu saisir les actions des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9tenues par M. Charbonneau et liquider, entre autres, les comptes bancaires pour \u00e9ponger, du moins en partie, la dette fiscale de M. Charbonneau.\n[95] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que vu que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions ont une personnalit\u00e9 juridique distincte de celle de leurs actionnaires et administrateurs, la Cour ne pourrait conclure que M. Charbonneau a fait un transfert \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1), vu que la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les ch\u00e8ques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis aux tiers par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s PAM et GAM, et non pas par M. Charbonneau.\n[96] L\u2019appelante cite les articles 301 et suivants du C.c.Q. pour soutenir sa position. Les articles pertinents se lisent ainsi:\n301. Les personnes morales ont la pleine jouissance des droits civils.\n302. Les personnes morales sont titulaires d\u2019un patrimoine qui peut, dans la seule mesure pr\u00e9vue par la loi, faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une division ou d\u2019une affectation. Elles ont aussi des droits et obligations extrapatrimoniaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 leur nature.\n303. Les personnes morales ont la capacit\u00e9 requise pour exercer tous leurs droits, et les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent code relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des droits civils par les personnes physiques leur sont applicables, compte tenu des adaptations n\u00e9cessaires.\nElles n\u2019ont d\u2019autres incapacit\u00e9s que celles qui r\u00e9sultent de leur nature ou d\u2019une disposition expresse de la loi.\n[97] La Cour ne retient pas cet argument de l\u2019appelante, compte tenu de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il faut donner au mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb retrouv\u00e9 au paragraphe 160(1) et de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019en a fait la jurisprudence comme expliqu\u00e9e ci-dessus. Il est clair que le paragraphe 160(1) ne requiert pas que le m\u00eame bien soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur fiscal \u00e0 son conjoint (ou \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre personne vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 160(1)) pour recevoir application.\n[98] La Cour conclut \u00e9galement, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et l\u2019augmentation du patrimoine de Mme Panneton, vu que les paiements faits aux tiers par GAM et PAM ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en une diminution du patrimoine de M. Charbonneau et une augmentation \u00e9quivalente du patrimoine de Mme Panneton.\n[99] La Cour conclut donc que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton au sens du paragraphe 160(1).\n[100] Ayant conclu que M. Charbonneau a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des biens totalisant 141 109,38 $ \u00ab indirectement\u2026 de toute autre fa\u00e7on \u00bb \u00e0 Mme Panneton, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la Cour de conclure quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, ce 26e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nJuge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 24\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2019-1067(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nDIANE PANNETON ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nle 6 d\u00e9cembre 2023\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR :\nL'honorable juge Dominique Lafleur\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nle 26 f\u00e9vrier 2024\nCOMPARUTIONS:\nAvocat de l'appelante :\nMe Simon St-Gelais\nAvocat de l'intim\u00e9 :\nMe Renaud Fioramore-Beaulieu\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER:\nPour l'appelante:\nNom :\nMe Simon St-Gelais\nCabinet :\nQuessy Henry St-Hilaire\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nShalene Curtis-Micallef\nSous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada\nOttawa, Canada",

INTRODUCTION\n[1] Les pr\u00e9sents motifs se rapportent aux appels interjet\u00e9s par Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. (\u00ab Skylight \u00bb), Suresh Kumar Aravindakshan (\u00ab Suresh \u00bb) et Titus George (\u00ab Titus \u00bb) relativement \u00e0 des cotisations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (la \u00ab LAE \u00bb)[1] et du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (le \u00ab RPC \u00bb)[2] par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb), repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb). La question fondamentale concernant ces appels est de savoir si Suresh, Titus et d\u2019autres travailleurs occupaient un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. En particulier, pour ce qui est de l\u2019appel de Skylight, deux questions pr\u00e9cises se posent : est-ce que Selvy Thomas (\u00ab Selvy \u00bb) exer\u00e7ait un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, et est-ce que Sheela Thomas (\u00ab Sheela \u00bb) exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\n[2] Comme on peut le constater, Selvy et Sheela portent le m\u00eame nom de famille; elles n\u2019ont toutefois aucun lien de parent\u00e9. Pour \u00e9viter toute confusion, je les d\u00e9signerai donc par leurs pr\u00e9noms. Par souci de coh\u00e9rence, je d\u00e9signerai \u00e9galement les deux appelants individuels et les autres travailleurs par leurs pr\u00e9noms.\n[3] Le 9 juillet 2018, le ministre a \u00e9mis des avis de cotisation pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er janvier 2015 au 31 octobre 2017 (la \u00ab p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00bb) en \u00e9valuation des cotisations faites au titre de la LAE et du RPC. Ces cotisations (les \u00ab cotisations \u00bb) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9es suivant l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que Sheela, Suresh, Titus et Akhill Jolly (\u00ab Akhill \u00bb) occupaient aupr\u00e8s de Skylight un emploi assurable, et que Selvy, Sheela, Suresh, Titus et Akhill occupaient aupr\u00e8s de Skylight un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les objections faites relativement aux cotisations, le ministre a confirm\u00e9 les cotisations le 7 novembre 2018.\nII. FAITS\n[4] Skylight a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en 2004. Au d\u00e9part, Selvy \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de Skylight. Par la suite, Sheela est devenu actionnaire en acqu\u00e9rant 50 % des actions \u00e9mises de Skylight, alors que Selvy d\u00e9tenait les 50 % restants.\nA. Renseignements concernant Selvy\n[5] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Selvy exer\u00e7ait des fonctions de cadre et d\u2019administratrice, et elle \u00e9tait actionnaire de Skylight. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00ab fond\u00e9 Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. en 2004 \u00bb[3].\n[6] Au d\u00e9part, Selvy \u00e9tait l\u2019unique actionnaire de Skylight. Un peu apr\u00e8s le 31 octobre 2017, la participation de Selvy dans Skylight a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 50 %[4].\nB. Renseignements concernant Sheela\n[7] \u00c0 un certain moment, apr\u00e8s le 31 octobre 2017, Selvy a obtenu que Sheela devienne actionnaire et d\u00e9tienne 50 % des actions de Skylight. Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Sheela \u00e9tait sa partenaire et qu\u2019elle \u00ab travaillait \u00e0 la vente de forfaits \u00bb[5].\nC. Renseignements concernant Akhill et Giya\n[8] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Selvy a expliqu\u00e9 que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Skylight comptait quatre employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 savoir elle-m\u00eame, Sheela, Akhill et Giya Joy (\u00ab Giya \u00bb). Selon Selvy, Akhill et Giya ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9s et \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s comme tels. Akhill et Giya recevaient tous deux un salaire, recevaient des feuillets T4 pour chaque ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, disposaient d\u2019un poste de travail dans les locaux de Skylight, avaient des horaires de travail fixes et \u00e9taient supervis\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9s. Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conditions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019Akhill et de Giya \u00e9taient fondamentalement diff\u00e9rentes des conditions relatives aux ententes conclues entre Skylight et Suresh et Titus.\n[9] Bien que Skylight semble avoir trait\u00e9 Akhill comme un employ\u00e9, le ministre a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audit de Skylight en se basant sur le fait que celle-ci avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 Akhill comme un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant[6].\nD. Renseignements concernant Suresh\n[10] Lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal, Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 au Canada depuis l\u2019Inde en 2015. Toutefois, lors du contre-interrogatoire, il a dit \u00eatre arriv\u00e9 au Canada en 2010 et avoir travaill\u00e9 pendant trois ans en tant que chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe dans un \u00e9tablissement de restauration rapide \u00e0 Toronto, avant de s\u2019inscrire \u00e0 un cours sur le voyage et le tourisme au Everest College. Apr\u00e8s avoir suivi ce cours, Suresh a appris que Skylight affichait un poste vacant et il a postul\u00e9. Lors de sa premi\u00e8re entrevue, Selvy lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il souhaitait travailler en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ou en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9. Il a choisi de travailler \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur, avec un salaire bas\u00e9 sur des commissions.\n[11] L\u2019un des principaux aspects du travail de Suresh consistait \u00e0 organiser des forfaits voyages. Mettant \u00e0 profit l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019il avait acquise en tant que directeur des op\u00e9rations h\u00f4teli\u00e8res en Inde et en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 des services alimentaires en Arabie saoudite, Suresh a \u00e9labor\u00e9 des forfaits voyages pour l\u2019Asie du Sud. Il s\u2019agissait de forfaits tout compris, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils incluaient les vols, l\u2019h\u00e9bergement, les transports terrestres (ou les transferts) et les excursions. Suresh travaillait avec deux fournisseurs, qu\u2019il a identifi\u00e9s comme Tamarind Services International (lequel s\u2019occupait des r\u00e9servations aupr\u00e8s des diff\u00e9rents h\u00f4tels et des compagnies de transport en Asie du Sud[7]) et Tours East (qui fournissait les billets d\u2019avion). Quelques fois, Suresh s\u2019occupait d\u2019organiser le transport a\u00e9rien de ses clients en utilisant SABRE[8].\n[12] Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaillait principalement \u00e0 partir de son domicile, o\u00f9 il disposait d\u2019un bureau ou d\u2019un espace de travail. Le mobilier de son bureau \u00e0 domicile comprenait un bureau de travail, qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, une chaise, un ordinateur portable et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable. Il se rendait occasionnellement dans les locaux de Skylight, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une fois par mois, pour d\u00e9poser une liste d\u00e9crivant les forfaits voyages et autres r\u00e9servations de voyage dont il s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9, de m\u00eame qu\u2019une liste des commissions per\u00e7ues \u00e0 ce titre. Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019aucune aide de la part de Skylight pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration des forfaits voyages. Habituellement, il d\u00e9posait aussi ses rapports de vente, intitul\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab Formulaires de commission d\u2019agent \u00bb, mais qu\u2019il appelait parfois \u00ab factures \u00bb.\n[13] Les commissions que percevait Suresh pour ses ventes \u00e9taient partag\u00e9es avec Skylight. Suresh avait droit \u00e0 70 % du montant de chaque commission et Skylight obtenait les 30 % restants. Cette condition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et n\u00e9goci\u00e9e lors de la premi\u00e8re rencontre entre Suresh et Selvy, et il en est question dans la lettre de confirmation sign\u00e9e par Selvy et par Suresh le 5 avril 2015[9].\n[14] Suresh recrutait ses clients principalement par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire des m\u00e9dias sociaux, mais aussi de ses amis et de ses connaissances au sein de sa communaut\u00e9, \u00e0 Toronto. Il faisait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sa publicit\u00e9 sur les m\u00e9dias sociaux en publiant des annonces (ce qu\u2019il appelait \u00ab feuillets publicitaires \u00bb) sur la plateforme Facebook.\n[15] Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019aucune aide de Skylight pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration des forfaits voyages, mis \u00e0 part l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 SABRE dont il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait et la permission d\u2019utiliser le nom de Skylight, lequel, il le reconna\u00eet, avait une certaine valeur.\n[16] Suresh ne connaissait pas les horaires de travail de Skylight, car il travaillait principalement \u00e0 domicile, fixait ses propres heures et \u00e9tait son propre patron.\n[17] Il a affirm\u00e9 que Selvy n\u2019avait jamais remis en question le volume de sa production ni sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019augmente, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas non plus supervis\u00e9 son travail.\n[18] Suresh pouvait prendre cong\u00e9 quand il le souhaitait. Il n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019obtenir la permission de Selvy ou de quiconque chez Skylight pour prendre des vacances. Toutefois, s\u2019il devait s\u2019absenter plus de quelques jours, il en informait Skylight par courtoisie. Skylight ne lui versait pas d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de vacances.\n[19] Skylight mettait des cartes de visite \u00e0 la disposition de ses travailleurs. Cependant, Suresh a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il fabriquait ses propres cartes de visite, qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait apparemment utiliser. Il payait lui-m\u00eame pour l\u2019impression de ses propres cartes de visite. Sur ses cartes se trouvaient \u00e0 la fois le nom de Skylight et le sien, ainsi que les num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur de Skylight et son propre num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable. Les cartes de visite indiquaient \u00e9galement l\u2019adresse \u00e9lectronique de Skylight et le nom de domaine du site Web de Skylight.\n[20] Suresh a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de le joindre en t\u00e9l\u00e9phonant chez Skylight. Si quelqu\u2019un appelait ce num\u00e9ro et souhaitait lui parler, la personne qui r\u00e9pondait chez Skylight donnait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l\u2019appelant le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable de Suresh.\n[21] Suresh a achet\u00e9 un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable en 2013. Pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, il en \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et payait les factures mensuelles du service t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[22] Bien que ses cartes de visite indiquaient le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur de Skylight, ses clients ne lui ont jamais envoy\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie. Ils ont toujours communiqu\u00e9 avec lui par courriel ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, en l\u2019appelant sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable. Il n\u2019essayaient pas de le joindre en appelant chez Skylight.\nE. Renseignements concernant Titus\n[23] Il y a plusieurs dizaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es, Titus, qui \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 69 ans au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction, \u00e9tait agent de voyage \u00e0 Duba\u00ef. En 1996, il est venu au Canada pour une courte p\u00e9riode. Il est ensuite parti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger pendant pr\u00e8s de cinq ans, puis est revenu au Canada au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000. Pendant une quinzaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, il a travaill\u00e9 pour des entreprises qui ne font pas partie de l\u2019industrie du voyage. D\u00e9sireux de travailler de nouveau dans le domaine du voyage, Titus a li\u00e9 contact avec Skylight en 2015, alors qu\u2019il recherchait un poste \u00e0 temps partiel. Il a choisi Skylight parce que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans les voyages en Inde du Sud, qui est son secteur de pr\u00e9dilection.\n[24] Selon Selvy et Titus, lors de leur premi\u00e8re rencontre, le 11 janvier 2015, Selvy a imprim\u00e9 une br\u00e8ve lettre sur du papier portant l\u2019en-t\u00eate de Skylight et ils l\u2019ont tous deux sign\u00e9e. Puisque cette lettre est assez br\u00e8ve, la partie la plus importante de celle-ci est cit\u00e9e ci-dessous :\n[traduction] Nous souhaitons confirmer que vous (M. Titus George) travaillez actuellement avec Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur au sein du service des voyages et du tourisme. Vous \u00eates employ\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019agent de voyage avec une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration bas\u00e9e sur des commissions, lesquelles seront vers\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on convenue au moment de la signature. Veuillez noter qu\u2019il vous incombe de d\u00e9clarer vos revenus et de payer toutes les taxes et tous les imp\u00f4ts applicables \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, directement aupr\u00e8s de votre comptable[10].\n[25] Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon sa compr\u00e9hension, Titus avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par Skylight pour travailler en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. Le t\u00e9moignage de Titus n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement quelle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment son intention en ce qui concerne son statut professionnel. Il semble qu\u2019il se souciait davantage d\u2019\u00eatre engag\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 temps plein.\n[26] Bien que Titus ait beaucoup travaill\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019agent de voyage \u00e0 Duba\u00ef, c\u2019\u00e9tait des ann\u00e9es avant qu\u2019il ne soit engag\u00e9 par Skylight. \u00c0 Duba\u00ef, il n\u2019utilisait pas le syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9servation SABRE. Il a donc d\u00fb suivre une formation concernant SABRE et d\u2019autres aspects de l\u2019industrie canadienne du voyage. Cette formation a dur\u00e9 environ une semaine, temps pour lequel il n\u2019a re\u00e7u ni r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ni aucun autre paiement de la part de Skylight.\n[27] Tous les agents de voyage de l\u2019Ontario doivent \u00eatre titulaires d\u2019une licence d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par l\u2019Organisme de r\u00e9glementation de voyage de l\u2019Ontario (Travel Industry Council of Ontario, ou \u00ab TICO \u00bb). Titus s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour passer l\u2019examen du TICO et a pay\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame les frais d\u2019examen totalisant 200 $. Skylight ne lui a pas rembours\u00e9 ce montant.\n[28] Titus ne s\u2019occupait pas de r\u00e9server des excursions touristiques. Son travail consistait \u00e0 r\u00e9server des billets d\u2019avion pour des clients, ce qui lui rapportait des commissions.\n[29] Skylight ne v\u00e9rifiait pas les heures de travail de Titus. Titus informait simplement Skylight avant de partir en vacances, et n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 lui demander la permission de le faire. Son niveau de productivit\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question[11]. Skylight n\u2019a fourni \u00e0 Titus aucune fourniture de bureau, mis \u00e0 part des cartes de visite[12].\nF. Modalit\u00e9s de facturation et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de Suresh et Titus\n[30] Ni Suresh ni Titus ne recevait de salaire de la part de Skylight. Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, les seuls revenus que percevaient Suresh et Titus correspondaient \u00e0 70 % des commissions que percevait Skylight sur leurs ventes. Des commissions relatives au travail effectu\u00e9 par Suresh et Titus \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es \u00e0 Skylight en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques des compagnies a\u00e9riennes, des h\u00f4tels et des autres entreprises li\u00e9es aux voyages, ainsi que de la m\u00e9thode par laquelle les clients voyageurs achetaient leurs billets d\u2019avion, leur h\u00e9bergement et tout autre service li\u00e9 au voyage. P\u00e9riodiquement, Suresh et Titus fournissaient \u00e0 Skylight des rapports sous forme de tableaux listant les billets, les excursions touristiques ou autres forfaits achet\u00e9s par leurs clients respectifs, ainsi que le montant de la commission vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Skylight pour le compte de Suresh ou de Titus, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Skylight, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u ces rapports et confirm\u00e9 que les commissions avaient bien \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues, \u00e9mettait p\u00e9riodiquement des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019intention de Suresh et de Titus pour leur verser leur part respective des commissions, soit 70 % du montant.\nIII. QUESTIONS \u00c0 TRANCHER\n[31] Les questions relatives aux pr\u00e9sents appels sont les suivantes :\na)Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, est-ce que Selvy exer\u00e7ait un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\nb)Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, est-ce que Sheela exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\nc)Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, est-ce que Akhill exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\nd)Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, est-ce que Suresh exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\ne)Au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, est-ce que Titus exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension?\nIV. ENJEUX DE LA PREUVE\nA. Entente par lettre\n[32] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction, une proc\u00e9dure de voir-dire a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une entente par lettre dat\u00e9e du 5 avril 2015 et conclue entre Skylight et Suresh[13] et, plus tard, d\u2019une entente par lettre quelque peu similaire dat\u00e9e du 11 janvier 2015 et conclue entre Skylight et Titus (dont la quasi-totalit\u00e9 est cit\u00e9e ci-dessus)[14]. L\u2019avocate du ministre s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la production de ces deux ententes par lettre, au motif que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel indiquait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu que des ententes verbales[15]. L\u2019avocate du ministre semblait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait que les ententes par lettre \u00e9taient produites tardivement et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de documents int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. L\u2019avocate du ministre n\u2019a obtenu une copie de l\u2019entente par lettre de Suresh qu\u2019une semaine avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction; le propre avocat de Titus n\u2019a appris l\u2019existence de l\u2019entente par lettre sign\u00e9e par ce dernier qu\u2019au milieu de la proc\u00e9dure de voir-dire, et l\u2019avocate du ministre n\u2019en savait rien non plus.\n[33] Une autre pr\u00e9occupation concernait le papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate sur lequel les deux ententes par lettre \u00e9taient imprim\u00e9es, car toutes deux affichaient des adresses diff\u00e9rentes pour Skylight. Pour expliquer la situation, Selvy a affirm\u00e9 que, depuis sa constitution en 2004 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un peu avant 2015, l\u2019adresse de Skylight \u00e9tait le 3428 Sheppard Avenue East, Scarborough, Ontario. En 2015, l\u2019adresse de Skylight \u00e9tait le 3300 McNicoll Avenue, Scarborough, Ontario[16]. Peu apr\u00e8s, Skylight a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 ses locaux au 3341 Markham Road, \u00e0 Toronto. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Titus a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 Selvy pour son entretien d\u2019embauche initial, en janvier 2015, les locaux de Skylight \u00e9taient situ\u00e9s au 3300 McNicoll Avenue. Cependant, l\u2019adresse figurant sur l\u2019entente par lettre de Titus, dat\u00e9e du 11 janvier 2015, est le 3341 Markham Road. L\u2019adresse figurant sur l\u2019entente par lettre de Suresh, dat\u00e9e du 5 avril 2015, est le 3428 Sheppard Avenue East.\n[34] Selvy a expliqu\u00e9 ces divergences par le fait que lorsque Skylight a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 ses locaux de Sheppard Avenue \u00e0 McNicoll Avenue, elle disposait d\u2019une grande quantit\u00e9 de papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate inutilis\u00e9 portant l\u2019adresse de Sheppard Avenue. Skylight a donc continu\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser ce papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit \u00e9puis\u00e9. C\u2019est pour cette raison que l\u2019entente par lettre de Suresh porte l\u2019adresse de l\u2019avenue Sheppard. Selvy a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019autour de 2017, Titus avait eu besoin d\u2019envoyer une copie de son entente par lettre au TICO, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 retrouver sa copie. Le texte de l\u2019entente par lettre \u00e9tait encore stock\u00e9 dans l\u2019ordinateur de Skylight; Selvy l\u2019a donc r\u00e9imprim\u00e9e sur du papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate de Skylight, lequel, \u00e0 ce moment, portait la nouvelle adresse de Markham Road.\n[35] Selvy, Suresh et Titus ont tous trois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente par lettre qui leur \u00e9tait applicable. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 des deux ententes par lettre ne fait aucun doute, m\u00eame si l\u2019on peut se demander si elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 antidat\u00e9es. Ainsi, apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au voir-dire, j\u2019ai admis les deux ententes par lettre en tant que preuves en pr\u00e9cisant que je d\u00e9terminerais le poids qui convient de leur accorder, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[36] En prenant cette d\u00e9cision (d\u2019admettre les ententes par lettre comme preuves), j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par Selvy. Il n\u2019est pas rare qu\u2019une entreprise utilise un papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate obsol\u00e8te avant de commencer \u00e0 utiliser un nouveau papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate portant les renseignements actualis\u00e9s. Selvy et Titus (lequel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent dans la salle d\u2019audience lorsque Selvy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9) ont tous deux confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019entente par lettre du 11 janvier 2015 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9imprim\u00e9e autour de 2017 parce que le TICO en demandait une copie. Un autre d\u00e9tail \u00e0 noter est que si Selvy, Suresh et Titus avaient voulu fabriquer les ententes par lettre \u00e0 la veille de l\u2019instruction des pr\u00e9sents appels, il est probable que les deux ententes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9es sur le m\u00eame papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate. Le fait que les deux ententes par lettre aient \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9es sur du papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate diff\u00e9rent tend \u00e0 confirmer qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9es \u00e0 la veille de l\u2019instruction.\n[37] Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, le ministre et l\u2019ARC sont pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par le fait qu\u2019ils ont soi-disant \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s par Selvy, Suresh ou Titus que les seules ententes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 conclues entre Skylight et Suresh et entre Skylight et Titus \u00e9taient des ententes verbales, et non pas des ententes \u00e9crites. En examinant l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019AE et l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant le RPC d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Skylight, je constate que le paragraphe 6 de chacun de ces actes de proc\u00e9dure indique que [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019entente verbale conclue entre Skylight et ces personnes [...] pr\u00e9voyait ce qui suit \u00bb; cette affirmation est suivie d\u2019une liste de neuf termes d\u00e9crivant les arrangements conclus entre Skylight et Suresh et entre Skylight et Titus. Je n\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 aucune disposition dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces avis d\u2019appel indiquant qu\u2019il n\u2019existait qu\u2019une entente verbale, mais pas d\u2019entente \u00e9crite. En examinant l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019AE et l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant le RPC d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Suresh, ainsi que l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019AE et l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant le RPC d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par Titus, je n\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une entente verbale ou \u00e0 une entente \u00e9crite en soi. Comme on peut le constater en examinant les deux ententes par lettre, les portions les plus importantes de ces ententes sont extr\u00eamement br\u00e8ves. Je ne trouve ni inhabituel ni incoh\u00e9rent que chacune des ententes par lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par une entente verbale permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir des conditions suppl\u00e9mentaires de l\u2019entente entre Skylight et Suresh et de l\u2019entente entre Skylight et Titus. En outre, je n\u2019ai vu aucune d\u00e9claration, dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure ou ailleurs, selon laquelle Skylight, Suresh ou Titus auraient confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait qu\u2019une entente verbale mais aucune entente \u00e9crite.\n[38] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019instruction, lorsque j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par deux agentes de l\u2019ARC (dont les rapports seront analys\u00e9s ci-dessous), j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que ces derni\u00e8res avaient reconnu que l\u2019intention de Skylight, de Suresh et de Titus \u00e9tait que ces deux personnes travaillent pour Skylight \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants, et non \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9s[17]. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ai conclu que les ententes par lettre pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant suffisamment de poids pour confirmer l\u2019intention des parties et la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de leurs relations respectives.\n[39] Malgr\u00e9 quelques trous de m\u00e9moire ponctuels[18], j\u2019estime que Selvy, Suresh et Titus sont des t\u00e9moins cr\u00e9dibles et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fiables. Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration leurs t\u00e9moignages et analys\u00e9 les ententes par lettre et les circonstances de leur formation, j\u2019ai conclu que je pouvais m\u2019appuyer sur chacune des ententes par lettre comme confirmant l\u2019intention des parties de lier une relation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, et non une relation employeur-employ\u00e9.\nB. Rapports et t\u00e9moignages des v\u00e9rificateurs\n[40] L\u2019avocate du ministre a cit\u00e9 deux t\u00e9moins de l\u2019ARC. Le premier t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ARC, que j\u2019appellerai \u00ab l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb, est actuellement agente int\u00e9rimaire des appels concernant le RPC et l\u2019AE. Elle a travaill\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions aux fins du RPC et de l\u2019AE de 2013 \u00e0 2021. Le deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ARC, que j\u2019appellerai \u00ab l\u2019agente des appels \u00bb, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019ARC en 2008. En 2014, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e agente des appels concernant le RPC et l\u2019AE; en 2018, elle est devenue agente des ressources des appels concernant le RPC et l\u2019AE. Elle est actuellement conseill\u00e8re en d\u00e9veloppement des programmes et de la formation pour la division des appels concernant le RPC et l\u2019AE.\n[41] L\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Suresh[19] et un autre rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Titus[20]. Le contenu des deux rapports est presque identique. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a reconnu qu\u2019elle avait en beaucoup utilis\u00e9 la fonction copier-coller[21].\n[42] Chacun des deux rapports de d\u00e9cision est un document composite, qui commence par des d\u00e9tails et des renseignements concernant Suresh (dans le cas de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112) et Titus (dans le cas de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113). Suit une portion plus volumineuse intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Faits \u00bb, d\u2019une longueur d\u2019environ six pages. Cette portion du rapport est cens\u00e9e, entre autres, r\u00e9sumer les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques distinctes que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a eues le 7 juin 2017 avec Suresh et Titus, respectivement, ainsi qu\u2019avec Selvy. La partie suivante de chaque rapport de d\u00e9cision est intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Statut professionnel \u00bb. Les faits que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a soi-disant obtenus de Suresh et Titus, respectivement, ainsi que de Selvy, y sont analys\u00e9s. Selon chaque rapport de d\u00e9cision, la conclusion est que le travailleur concern\u00e9 (Suresh ou Titus) exer\u00e7ait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. La derni\u00e8re partie de chaque rapport de d\u00e9cision est intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9cision \u00bb. Cette portion de texte sugg\u00e8re que le statut des ententes de travail respectives de Suresh et de Titus a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9, passant de [traduction] \u00ab Contrat pour service \u00bb [sic] \u00e0 \u00ab Contrat de service \u00bb.\n[43] Comme indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a reconnu qu\u2019elle avait eu recours de nombreuses fois \u00e0 la fonction copier-coller lors de la pr\u00e9paration de ses rapports. La portion analytique (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la partie intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Statut professionnel \u00bb) \u00e9tait identique dans les deux rapports. La similitude entre le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des deux conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a eues le 7 juin 2017 avec Suresh et avec Titus, respectivement, est encore plus troublante. De grandes parties des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de ces deux conversations sont identiques. On y remarque quelques diff\u00e9rences, comme, dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Titus, une indication selon laquelle celui-ci disait \u00eatre \u00ab r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 strictement \u00e0 la commission \u00bb[22], alors qu\u2019on ne trouve pas de d\u00e9claration semblable dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Suresh. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Suresh porte la mention suivante [traduction] : \u00ab Il a confirm\u00e9 que tous les documents administratifs portaient le nom de Skylight \u00bb[23]. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019entretien avec Titus ne contient aucune d\u00e9claration de ce type. \u00c0 l\u2019exception de ces points et de quelques autres diff\u00e9rences mineures, le libell\u00e9 des deux r\u00e9sum\u00e9s est essentiellement identique, sous r\u00e9serve de quelques efforts \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour faire para\u00eetre les deux documents diff\u00e9rents, comme la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Suresh en tant [traduction] qu\u2019\u00ab agent de vente de billets \u00bb et \u00e0 Titus en tant [traduction] qu\u2019\u00ab agent de voyage \u00bb, ou l\u2019utilisation du mot [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00bb dans l\u2019un des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s et du mot [traduction] \u00ab confirm\u00e9 \u00bb au m\u00eame endroit dans l\u2019autre, ou encore le choix du mot [traduction] \u00ab quotas \u00bb dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Titus et de l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab objectifs de vente \u00bb dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Suresh. Un autre exemple, dont il est question ci-dessous, est l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab Il a ri [...] \u00bb dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Suresh et de [traduction] \u00ab Il a rican\u00e9 [...] \u00bb dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conversation avec Titus.\n[44] L\u2019extr\u00eame similitude entre les deux rapports de d\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e en ces termes lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal de l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions :\n[traduction] Me ELLEITHY : [...] J\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que [...] beaucoup de formulations sont tr\u00e8s semblables. Ainsi, par exemple, [...] si l\u2019on compare le[s] rapport[s] de d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 7 [pi\u00e8ce R\u20112] et \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 8 [pi\u00e8ce R\u20113], on constate beaucoup de similitudes dans la structure, l\u2019ordre et le libell\u00e9 du texte. Pouvez-vous nous expliquer pourquoi?\n[AGENTE DES D\u00c9CISIONS] : Oui, c\u2019est vrai; il s\u2019agit en grande partie de texte copi\u00e9 et coll\u00e9, parce que c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose pour chaque dossier. Par exemple, lorsque j\u2019ai communiqu\u00e9 avec la propri\u00e9taire, ces renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 directement copi\u00e9s et coll\u00e9s dans --, car j\u2019ai appel\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps. Aussi, si je laissais le message \u00e0 -- de me rappeler concernant, vous savez, chaque travailleur, je changerais certainement le nom. Honn\u00eatement, pour ce poste en particulier, il n\u2019y a que -- et en traitant autant de dossiers, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un nombre limit\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9crire quelque chose comme \u00ab les outils et l\u2019\u00e9quipement n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par le travailleur \u00bb.\nDonc, encore une fois, beaucoup de choses se ressemblent parce que c\u2019est mon style d\u2019\u00e9criture et que j\u2019aborde, vous savez, la question des outils et de l\u2019\u00e9quipement, puis de la sous-traitance, et enfin des d\u00e9penses. Mais encore une fois, c\u2019est \u00e9galement personnalis\u00e9, parce que si quelque chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 -- vous savez, pour en revenir au rapport de d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent [c.-\u00e0-d.la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112] concernant Suresh, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai not\u00e9 qu\u2019il a rican\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019on lui a pos\u00e9 une question, ce genre de chose, c\u2019est sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 cette personne.\nC\u2019est pourquoi beaucoup de choses semblent identiques, parce qu\u2019elles le sont. Beaucoup de r\u00e9ponses sont les m\u00eames, mais j\u2019aime bien, encore une fois, adapter le tout \u00e0 ce travailleur en particulier et pr\u00e9ciser, par exemple, que j\u2019ai eu une conversation avec cette personne, parce que tout le monde ne va pas ricaner \u00e0 la m\u00eame question ou faire ses propres commentaires.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, nous ne pouvons pas faire figurer nos opinions personnelles dans le dossier. C\u2019est donc ce que nous faisons; dans ce cas, [ce que] j\u2019ai fait, c\u2019est d\u2019ajouter les informations qui \u00e9taient largement similaires, puis de les adapter en fonction de la situation de ce travailleur[24]. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[45] Comme l\u2019indiquent les passages soulign\u00e9s dans l\u2019\u00e9change entre l\u2019avocate du ministre et l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions reproduit ci-dessus, lequel a eu lieu au cours de la discussion sur le rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Titus (c.-\u00e0-d. la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113), l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa mention du \u00ab rapport de d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00bb (c.-\u00e0-d. la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, qui est le rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Suresh), o\u00f9 elle a not\u00e9 que la personne interrog\u00e9e avait rican\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019on avait pos\u00e9 une question, tout en indiquant que ce commentaire \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 cette personne. Ce commentaire sur \u00ab le rapport de d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait plus t\u00f4t dans son t\u00e9moignage, alors qu\u2019elle parlait du rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Suresh et que l\u2019avocate du ministre lui avait demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait ajout\u00e9 \u00ab Il a ri [...] \u00bb dans son rapport. L\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions a r\u00e9pondu ainsi :\n[traduction] Me ELLEITHY : Et je voulais vous demander pourquoi vous -- pourquoi est-ce quelque chose qu\u2019il vous fallait noter?\n[AGENTE DES D\u00c9CISIONS] : Eh bien, c\u2019est une r\u00e9action int\u00e9ressante \u00e0 la question, je pense, et \u00e7a \u00e9voque -- en quelque sorte, c\u2019est presque -- vous savez, lorsque quelqu\u2019un rit et trouve la question dr\u00f4le, alors que c\u2019est une question s\u00e9rieuse, d\u2019avoir ce genre de r\u00e9action. Et dans le dossier, vous savez, j\u2019aime toujours ajouter quelque chose qui est une sorte de -- vous savez, parce que vous ne pouvez \u00e9crire que certains paragraphes, l\u2019information, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, donc pour ajouter comme un petit commentaire personnel ou une r\u00e9action \u00e0 la question. Mais cette question en particulier -- c\u2019est ce dont je me souviens \u00e0 propos de ce dossier[25].\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[46] En parlant de Suresh et de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112 (peu avant que se produise l\u2019\u00e9change reproduit ci-dessus\u2011), l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 se souvenir [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019un monsieur qui ricanait \u00e0 propos du fait de ne pas partir en vacances \u00bb, mais ne pas se rappeler si ce monsieur \u00e9tait Suresh ou Titus[26]. L\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions peut avoir fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au commentaire suivant, qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit dans le rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Suresh (tel qu\u2019il figure dans la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112) :\n[traduction] Il a ri lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait re\u00e7u des invitations personnelles \u00e0 visiter des lieux de vill\u00e9giature et a il d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Selvy Thomas l\u2019avait fait, en tant que propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019agence de voyage[27].\nIl se peut aussi qu\u2019elle ait fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un commentaire qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit dans le rapport de d\u00e9cision concernant Titus (pi\u00e8ce R\u20113), lequel est cit\u00e9 dans le paragraphe suivant.\n[47] Bien que j\u2019aie d\u2019abord compris que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence faite par l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions aux ricanements de l\u2019homme visait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle se souvenait de cette conversation en particulier, et que son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette conversation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adapt\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 personnaliser cette conversation[28], je me demande maintenant si c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment le cas, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9claration suivante tir\u00e9e du r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de sa conversation avec Titus (c.-\u00e0-d. la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113) :\n[traduction] Il a rican\u00e9 et a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u d\u2019invitations personnelles \u00e0 visiter des lieux de vill\u00e9giature, mais a dit que Selvy Thomas l\u2019avait fait, en tant que propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019agence de voyage[29].\n[48] Au cours du contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat des appelants a fait remarquer que des portions importantes des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019a entretenues l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions avec Suresh et Titus semblaient \u00eatre absolument identiques et [traduction] qu\u2019\u00ab on aurait dit un copier-coller \u00bb[30]. Ensuite, lorsque l\u2019avocat des appelants a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas adapt\u00e9 les deux r\u00e9sum\u00e9s (comme elle l\u2019avait pr\u00e9tendu)[31], cette derni\u00e8re a r\u00e9pondu :\n[traduction] Il y a des parties du texte qui sont sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 chacun des individus. Mais apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 cette t\u00e2che si souvent, cela devient un peu -- ce n\u2019est pas un travail d\u2019\u00e9criture cr\u00e9ative[32].\n[49] Je suis tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la mani\u00e8re dont les rapports de d\u00e9cision ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. En ce qui concerne les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019a eu l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions avec Suresh et Titus, j\u2019ai l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle avait pens\u00e9 aux r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019elle voulait obtenir et qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9labor\u00e9 le langage dont elle aurait besoin pour consigner ces r\u00e9ponses. En ce qui concerne les parties analytiques des rapports de d\u00e9cision, le libell\u00e9 parfaitement identique des analyses des ententes de travail respectives de Suresh et de Titus am\u00e8ne \u00e0 se demander si l\u2019une des analyses a \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9e sur l\u2019autre, ou si toutes deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9es sur l\u2019analyse figurant dans un m\u00eame pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n[50] Compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont les rapports de d\u00e9cision ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s, je m\u2019interroge sur le fait que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions ait pu traiter les dossiers de Suresh et de Titus individuellement, ou ait plut\u00f4t adopt\u00e9 une approche \u00ab applicable \u00e0 tous \u00bb pour son audit. Par cons\u00e9quent, puisque ses rapports diff\u00e8rent des t\u00e9moignages des appelants, je suis enclin \u00e0 me fier davantage \u00e0 ces t\u00e9moignages plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux rapports.\n[51] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les rapports de d\u00e9cision contiennent des d\u00e9clarations faites \u00e0 l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions par Selvy, Suresh ou Titus, la question de savoir si ces rapports contenaient des preuves par ou\u00ef-dire a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e lors de l\u2019instruction. Dans un premier temps, l\u2019avocate du ministre a inform\u00e9 la Cour qu\u2019elle souhaitait produire les rapports pour la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leur contenu. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s que la question de la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, l\u2019avocate du ministre a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019appuyait sur les rapports uniquement pour contester la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des travailleurs, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour montrer que les d\u00e9clarations en question avaient bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, et non pas pour montrer qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessairement vraies. Compte tenu de la mani\u00e8re dont les rapports de d\u00e9cision ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s, je ne suis pas convaincu que les d\u00e9clarations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites y aient \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement consign\u00e9es.\n[52] Je ne consid\u00e8re pas que les rapports de d\u00e9cision mettent en cause la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Selvy, de Suresh ou de Titus. Au contraire, compte tenu de leur contenu \u00ab copi\u00e9-coll\u00e9 \u00bb, je me demande plut\u00f4t si les rapports reproduisent fid\u00e8lement les d\u00e9clarations qui ont pu \u00eatre faites par Selvy, Suresh et Titus \u00e0 l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions.\n[53] La similitude entre les rapports de d\u00e9cision concernant Suresh (pi\u00e8ce R\u20112) et Titus (pi\u00e8ce R\u20113) pourrait s\u2019expliquer par l\u2019existence d\u2019un obstacle \u00e0 la communication entre l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions, d\u2019une part, et Suresh et Titus, d\u2019autre part. Sans vouloir leur manquer de respect, j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que, lors de leurs t\u00e9moignages oraux, il \u00e9tait parfois difficile de comprendre ce que disait Suresh, et encore plus Titus. En outre, j\u2019ai observ\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises au cours du t\u00e9moignage de Titus que ce dernier semblait comprendre la nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des questions qui lui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019en saisissait pas tous les d\u00e9tails. Les difficult\u00e9s de communication que j\u2019ai observ\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019audience pourraient bien avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 exacerb\u00e9es au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, qui est le moyen utilis\u00e9 par l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions pour interroger Suresh et Titus.\n[54] Qu\u2019il y ait eu ou non un obstacle \u00e0 la communication entre ces personnes, nous avons constat\u00e9 que sur plusieurs points (comme la question de savoir si Suresh et Titus travaillaient \u00e0 domicile ou dans les locaux de Skylight), les d\u00e9clarations \u00e9crites par l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions dans ses rapports de d\u00e9cision sont diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es aux d\u00e9clarations faites par Suresh et Titus \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, j\u2019estime que Suresh et Titus, de m\u00eame que Selvy, sont des personnes cr\u00e9dibles et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fiables. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re leurs preuves aux rapports de d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions.\n[55] En ce qui concerne l\u2019agente des appels, il \u00e9tait initialement pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019elle t\u00e9moigne le 20 octobre 2021; toutefois, l\u2019instruction ayant progress\u00e9 plus lentement que pr\u00e9vu, elle n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner que le 26 avril 2022. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir examin\u00e9, en octobre 2021, en pr\u00e9paration de son t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu le 20 octobre 2021, ses Notes pour le dossier (formulaire T2020)[33] et son rapport sur un appel (formulaire CPT110)[34]. Cependant, elle a reconnu ne pas avoir relu la note et le rapport entre le 20 octobre 2021 et le d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, soit le 26 avril 2022. Elle a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019elle ne se souvenait pas des conversations individuelles qu\u2019elle avait eues avec Suresh et Titus. Par cons\u00e9quent, je doute de la fiabilit\u00e9 de ses souvenirs et de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[56] Je souhaite faire un commentaire \u00e0 propos de la terminologie utilis\u00e9e par l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions et l\u2019agente des appels (ensemble, \u00ab les agentes \u00bb) dans leurs rapports respectifs. Plut\u00f4t que d\u2019utiliser les termes [traduction] contrat de travail et contrat ind\u00e9pendant, les agentes ont, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, utilis\u00e9 des termes anciens et traditionnels, soit [traduction] contrat de service et contrat pour services. Bien que ces deux ensembles de termes soient acceptables, les agentes utilisent souvent l\u2019expression \u00ab contrat pour services \u00bb lorsqu\u2019elles font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un contrat de services. Je trouve cette terminologie ambigu\u00eb, car il n\u2019est pas toujours facile de savoir si elles font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un contrat de service et ont ajout\u00e9 par inadvertance un \u00ab s \u00bb \u00e0 la fin du mot \u00ab service \u00bb, ou si elles font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un contrat pour services et ont substitu\u00e9 par inadvertance le mot de \u00ab de \u00bb mot \u00ab pour \u00bb. L\u2019extrait qui suit, issu de l\u2019un des rapports de l\u2019agente des appels, illustre bien cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Il est recommand\u00e9 que les parties concern\u00e9es par cet appel soient inform\u00e9es, par voie d\u2019avis minist\u00e9riel, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s un examen complet et impartial des renseignements fournis, les travailleurs Selvy Thomas, Sureh [sic] Aravindaksha [sic], George Titus [sic], Akhill Jolly et Sheela Thomas \u00e9taient engag\u00e9s par le payeur, Skylight Travel & Tours Inc., au titre d\u2019un contrat de service durant les p\u00e9riodes respect\u00e9es [sic] pour lesquelles ils font l\u2019objet d\u2019une v\u00e9rification. Les conditions d\u2019un contrat de services \u00e9taient remplies; il existait donc une relation d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9[35]. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nV. ANALYSE :\nA. Statut de Selvy\n[57] Dans ses avis d\u2019appel, Skylight a plaid\u00e9 que Selvy et Sheela d\u00e9tenaient chacune 50 % des actions ordinaires de Skylight et que la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019une des v\u00e9rificatrices de l\u2019ARC, selon laquelle Selvy d\u00e9tenait 100 % des actions ordinaires de Skylight, \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. Toutefois, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Selvy a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait 100 % des actions ordinaires de Skylight au moment de sa constitution et pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e[36], et que, quelque temps apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Sheela avait acquis 50 % des actions ordinaires \u00e9mises de Skylight.\n[58] Comme Selvy a toujours d\u00e9tenu plus de 40 % des actions ordinaires (qui sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es \u00eatre les seules actions avec droit de vote) de Skylight, son emploi chez Skylight n\u2019\u00e9tait pas assurable[37].\n[59] Au cours de l\u2019instruction, Selvy a confirm\u00e9 que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e par Skylight dans un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension[38].\nB. Statut de Sheela\n[60] Dans son l\u2019avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019AE, Skylight fait valoir que Sheela et Selvy d\u00e9tenaient chacun 50 % de ses actions avec droit de vote, de sorte que, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(2)b) de la LAE, Sheela n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas un emploi assurable[39]. Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle et Sheela \u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle d\u00e9tentrices \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales des actions de Skylight. Toutefois, au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Selvy d\u00e9tenait la totalit\u00e9 des actions avec droit de vote de Skylight. Par cons\u00e9quent, s\u2019il appara\u00eet que l\u2019emploi actuel de Sheela chez Skylight n\u2019est pas un emploi assurable, son emploi chez Skylight au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00e9tait un emploi assurable.\n[61] Au cours de l\u2019instruction, Skylight a admis que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Sheela avait occup\u00e9 un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension chez Skylight[40].\nC. Statut d\u2019Akhill\n[62] Les avis d\u2019appel de Skylight portent principalement sur les situations particuli\u00e8res de Suresh et Titus, et font mention de fa\u00e7on secondaire \u00e0 Selvy et Sheela, sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Akhill. Au cours de l\u2019instruction, Skylight a confirm\u00e9 le fait que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Akhill avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par Skylight et occupait un emploi assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension[41].\nD. Principes juridiques applicables aux cas de Suresh et Titus\n[63] Selon les plaidoiries, Skylight, Suresh et Titus estiment que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Skylight a engag\u00e9 Suresh et Titus en vertu d\u2019un contrat ind\u00e9pendant (parfois appel\u00e9 contrat pour services) et non en vertu d\u2019un contrat d\u2019emploi (parfois appel\u00e9 contrat de service). En revanche, le ministre adopte la position inverse. Pour r\u00e9soudre cette question, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019appliquer le processus analytique en deux \u00e9tapes d\u00e9crit par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Connor Homes[42].\n[64] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 que, pour d\u00e9terminer si un travailleur est un employ\u00e9 ou un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, il est n\u00e9cessaire de prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019intention du travailleur et celle de la personne qui l\u2019a embauch\u00e9, ainsi que les facteurs traditionnels \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les affaires Sagaz Industries et Wiebe Door[43]. Ces facteurs sont les suivants :\n(a) L\u2019employeur contr\u00f4le-t-il les activit\u00e9s du travailleur?\n(b) L\u2019employeur fournit-il les outils et l\u2019\u00e9quipement requis par le travailleur, ou le travailleur doit-il fournir ses propres outils et son propre \u00e9quipement?\n(c) Le travailleur engage-t-il lui-m\u00eame ses assistants?\n(d) Quel est le degr\u00e9 de risque financier pris par le travailleur? En d\u2019autres termes, le travailleur court-il un risque de perte?\n(e) Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point le travailleur est-il responsable des mises de fonds et de la gestion?\n(f) Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point le travailleur peut-il tirer profit de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches[44]?\n[65] Au cours des deux derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies, certains tribunaux ont not\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas de dichotomie nette entre un contrat de travail et un contrat ind\u00e9pendant, mais plut\u00f4t un continuum entre les deux, avec la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 \u00e0 une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, la relation entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant \u00e0 l\u2019autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, et une relation hybride, interm\u00e9diaire ou entrepreneur d\u00e9pendant \u00ab quelque part au milieu \u00bb[45]. Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis qu\u2019une relation hybride, interm\u00e9diaire ou entrepreneur d\u00e9pendant s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une relation employeur-employ\u00e9, mais n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame[46]. Pour d\u00e9terminer si un travailleur est un employ\u00e9 ou un entrepreneur d\u00e9pendant, les tribunaux ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement appliqu\u00e9 les m\u00eames principes que ceux utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer si un travailleur est un employ\u00e9 ou un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant[47].\n[66] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les principes utilis\u00e9s pour distinguer un entrepreneur d\u00e9pendant d\u2019un employ\u00e9 sont semblables \u00e0 ceux utilis\u00e9s pour distinguer un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019un employ\u00e9, j\u2019utiliserai parfois simplement dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs le terme entrepreneur, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant ou entrepreneur d\u00e9pendant.\nE. Statut de Suresh\n[67] Conform\u00e9ment aux orientations fournies par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes, je commencerai par d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait une compr\u00e9hension mutuelle ou une intention commune entre Skylight et Suresh concernant leur relation. Je me pencherai ensuite sur les facteurs d\u00e9finis dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette intention mutuelle (le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant) d\u00e9cider si, tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, les faits pertinents soutiennent cette intention et sont compatibles avec celle-ci ou, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019intention mutuelle, d\u00e9terminer si ces facteurs rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un emploi ou d\u2019un contrat ind\u00e9pendant.\n(1) Intention [68] Au d\u00e9but de la relation de Suresh avec Skylight, Selvy et Suresh ont sign\u00e9 une entente par lettre, dat\u00e9e du 5 avril 2015, imprim\u00e9e sur le papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate de Skylight. L\u2019entente par lettre est relativement br\u00e8ve et ne contient qu\u2019un seul paragraphe, que je cite ci-dessous :\n[traduction] Nous souhaitons confirmer que vous (Suresh Aravindakshan) est [sic] actuellement \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Skylight Travel & Tours Inc. en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur dans le secteur des voyages et du tourisme. M. Aravindakshan doit recevoir 70 % des commissions \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent, comme convenu au moment de la signature. Veuillez noter qu\u2019il vous incombe de d\u00e9clarer vos revenus et de payer toutes les taxes et tous les imp\u00f4ts applicables \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, directement aupr\u00e8s de votre comptable[48].\n[69] En me basant sur la lettre susmentionn\u00e9e, ainsi que sur les t\u00e9moignages de Selvy et de Suresh, je crois comprendre qu\u2019ils ont tous deux compris et eu comme intention que Suresh travaille pour Skylight en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9. En outre, il semble que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions et l\u2019agente des appels aient \u00e9galement reconnu que Selvy (au nom de Skylight) et Suresh avaient comme intention que Suresh travaille en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant[49].\n(2) Contr\u00f4le [70] Pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si Skylight exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le sur le travail qu\u2019ex\u00e9cutait Suresh pour Skylight, Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Skylight n\u2019attendait pas de Suresh qu\u2019il travaille un certain nombre d\u2019heures chaque semaine ou qu\u2019il produise un certain volume de ventes[50].\n[71] Suresh avait la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des cong\u00e9s de maladie ou des vacances quand il le souhaitait[51]. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Suresh a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il fixait lui-m\u00eame ses horaires de travail et qu\u2019il pouvait prendre des cong\u00e9s quand il le souhaitait[52], bien qu\u2019il ait toujours pr\u00e9venu Skylight lorsqu\u2019il partait en vacances et qu\u2019il ait indiqu\u00e9 quels jours il ne serait pas disponible pour travailler[53].\n[72] Lorsque Suresh r\u00e9alisait une vente aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un client, il n\u2019en avisait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas Selvy[54]. Cependant, Suresh informait Selvy si des clients devaient se pr\u00e9senter chez Skylight pour payer un forfait voyage[55], afin d\u2019assurer que Skylight puisse rapidement transf\u00e9rer l\u2019argent \u00e0 l\u2019organisateur du voyage en question[56].\n[73] Suresh pr\u00e9parait ses propres factures pour les commissions qu\u2019il devait percevoir sur les ventes qu\u2019il r\u00e9alisait. Il apportait ses factures dans les locaux de Skylight toutes les deux semaines[57].\n[74] Skylight \u00e9mettait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019intention de Suresh pour lui payer les 70 % des commissions per\u00e7ues qui lui revenaient, Skylight conservant les 30 % restants[58].\n[75] Skylight n\u2019effectuait pas d\u2019\u00e9valuation des performances de Suresh et ne fixait pas d\u2019objectifs de vente pour lui[59].\n[76] Le titre de Suresh chez Skylight \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab coordinateur de voyages \u00bb. C\u2019est un titre qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame choisi. Skylight n\u2019a pas remis en question le choix de ce titre[60].\n[77] D\u2019apr\u00e8s ma compr\u00e9hension des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, Skylight ne contr\u00f4lait pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s professionnelles de Suresh. Ce facteur pointe fortement vers un statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n(3) Mat\u00e9riel et \u00e9quipement [78] Suresh travaillait principalement \u00e0 partir de son domicile, o\u00f9 il avait install\u00e9 un bureau ou un autre espace de travail. Il a pay\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame son mobilier de bureau, notamment un bureau et une chaise de travail. Il a fourni son propre ordinateur portable et son propre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable[61]. Les locaux occup\u00e9s par Skylight \u00e9taient assez petits (environ 450 \u00e0 550 pieds carr\u00e9s, soit entre 42 et 46 m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s) et \u00e9taient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement utilis\u00e9s par Selvy, Sheela, Akhill et Giya. Suresh ne disposait que de peu d\u2019espace physique pour travailler dans les locaux de Skylight, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y avait pas de bureau ou d\u2019espace de travail pour lui[62]. Suresh utilisait son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable personnel pour ses activit\u00e9s professionnelles et il payait lui-m\u00eame ses factures de services t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques[63]. Suresh a lui-m\u00eame fourni la totalit\u00e9 de ses fournitures et de son \u00e9quipement de travail[64].\n[79] Skylight a fourni \u00e0 Suresh un mot de passe lui permettant d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la licence d\u2019utilisation de SABRE, ainsi que des cartes de visite indiquant le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le num\u00e9ro sans frais et le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur de Skylight[65]. Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait obtenu de Skylight le mod\u00e8le des cartes de visite et qu\u2019il avait imprim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame ses cartes, \u00e0 ses frais[66]. Les clients de Suresh l\u2019appelaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable et utilisaient rarement le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Skylight pour le joindre; ils ne lui envoyaient pas de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie[67]. Skylight a \u00e9galement fourni \u00e0 Suresh une adresse \u00e9lectronique et lui a permis d\u2019utiliser le syst\u00e8me de messagerie de Skylight[68].\n[80] Suresh n\u2019a pas eu \u00e0 payer de frais particuliers \u00e0 Skylight pour l\u2019utilisation de SABRE, du mod\u00e8le de carte de visite ou du syst\u00e8me de courrier \u00e9lectronique de Skylight. Selvy et Suresh ont expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une portion du 30 % des commissions g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es par Suresh et revenant \u00e0 Skylight \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 couvrir ces co\u00fbts[69].\n[81] Ce facteur pointe vers les deux directions.\n(4) Embauche d\u2019assistants [82] Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au nom de Skylight, que Suresh avait le loisir d\u2019embaucher un tiers en tant que sous-traitant, ou encore des assistants pour l\u2019aider dans son travail[70]. Suresh a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019engager un sous-traitant ou d\u2019embaucher quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 titre d\u2019assistant. Il est difficile de savoir, en se basant sur son t\u00e9moignage, si Suresh avait compris qu\u2019il avait, ou non, la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019engager un assistant[71]. Bien que le t\u00e9moignage de Selvy semble indiquer qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat ind\u00e9pendant plut\u00f4t que d\u2019un emploi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Suresh n\u2019a pas engag\u00e9 de sous-traitants ou d\u2019assistants, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas sembl\u00e9 comprendre pleinement et clairement les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es \u00e0 propos de ce facteur, je suis enclin \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer ce facteur comme un facteur neutre.\n(5) Risque de perte [83] Avant m\u00eame de commencer \u00e0 travailler pour Skylight, Suresh avait engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses. En 2014, Suresh a suivi, \u00e0 ses frais, plusieurs cours sur les voyages et le tourisme au Everest College[72]. Toujours \u00e0 ses frais, Suresh a \u00e9galement suivi des cours pr\u00e9paratoires \u00e0 l\u2019examen de licence du TICO, qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ussi, avant de commencer \u00e0 travailler pour Skylight[73].\n[84] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Suresh travaillait \u00e0 partir de son domicile et qu\u2019il devait fournir son propre ordinateur portable, son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable, son mobilier de bureau, ses fournitures, sa publicit\u00e9 et d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments li\u00e9s \u00e0 son travail, il a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses \u00e0 titre professionnel. Si un client r\u00e9servait un voyage aupr\u00e8s de Suresh et l\u2019annulait par la suite, Suresh ne recevait pas de commission, mais devait acquitter les frais d\u2019annulation[74]. En outre, comme sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement bas\u00e9e sur les commissions, il pouvait arriver, certains mois, que ses d\u00e9penses d\u00e9passent ses revenus.\n[85] \u00c0 mon avis, Suresh avait des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au travail relativement modestes. N\u00e9anmoins, comme il \u00e9tait toujours possible que ces d\u00e9penses soient plus importantes que ses revenus, Suresh risquait une perte. Ce facteur pointe vers un contrat ind\u00e9pendant.\n(6) Responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de mises de fonds et de gestion [86] Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e concernant ce facteur. Je consid\u00e8re donc qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur neutre ou inapplicable.\n(7) Possibilit\u00e9 de tirer un profit [87] Akhill et Giya, qui \u00e9taient des consultants en voyages et que Skylight a reconnu \u00eatre des employ\u00e9s, \u00e9taient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s par un salaire[75]. En revanche, Suresh \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 uniquement avec des commissions. De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Suresh avait ses propres clients, il a pu n\u00e9gocier une r\u00e9partition de la commission de 70 - 30 %, plut\u00f4t que de 60 - 40 %, ce qui (selon Selvy) est le niveau de r\u00e9partition standard dans l\u2019industrie du voyage[76].\n[88] Suresh a \u00e9labor\u00e9 ses propres forfaits voyages, qui comprenaient le transport a\u00e9rien, l\u2019h\u00e9bergement \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel et des excursions d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Il pr\u00e9parait ses propres feuillets publicitaires pour annoncer les forfaits, dont la publication \u00e9tait souvent programm\u00e9e pour co\u00efncider avec \u00ab une p\u00e9riode de f\u00eate \u00bb ou un jour f\u00e9ri\u00e9[77]. Il faisait la publicit\u00e9 de ses forfaits voyages gr\u00e2ce au bouche-\u00e0-oreille, aux m\u00e9dias sociaux et \u00e0 d\u2019autres moyens de promotion. Les vols inclus dans les forfaits \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9s par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du syst\u00e8me SABRE de Skylight, mais toutes les autres r\u00e9servations \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es par Suresh sans aucune aide de Skylight[78]. C\u2019est Suresh, et non Skylight, qui fixait les prix des excursions touristiques qu\u2019il vendait[79].\n[89] Au cours du contre-interrogatoire, Suresh a d\u00e9crit le processus qu\u2019il utilisait pour cr\u00e9er un forfait voyage. Suresh fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement appel aux services d\u2019un vendeur ou d\u2019un fournisseur en Inde, comme Tours East ou Tamarind Services International, car il estime qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du forfait (vols, h\u00e9bergement et transports terrestres) soient organis\u00e9s par une seule et m\u00eame entit\u00e9. Cependant, Suresh pr\u00e9parait lui-m\u00eame le forfait et donnait ensuite des instructions au vendeur s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9, pour que ce dernier effectue les r\u00e9servations en son nom (ou peut-\u00eatre parfois au nom de ses clients). Le vendeur facturait Suresh un certain prix, que Suresh payait. Lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9parait la facture pour ses clients, ult\u00e9rieurement, Suresh majorait de 5 %, 10 % ou 15 % le prix des forfaits, selon ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec ses clients, qui esp\u00e9raient parfois obtenir une remise[80].\n[90] En ce qui concerne les vols que Suresh r\u00e9servait en utilisant le compte SABRE de Skylight, il ne pouvait pas modifier le prix affich\u00e9 par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de SABRE, mais il pouvait d\u00e9cider de majorer ce prix, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il faisait[81].\n[91] Suresh a attest\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait ses propres clients. Lors de l\u2019instruction, il a soutenu qu\u2019il travaillait depuis six ou sept ans et qu\u2019il avait une liste de plus de 500 clients. Il a \u00e9galement dit que Skylight n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 sa liste (ou \u00e0 son dossier) de clients[82].\n[92] Selvy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 Suresh devait quitter Skylight, il avait la possibilit\u00e9 de garder sa liste de clients et de l\u2019utiliser dans une autre agence de voyage[83].\n[93] Suresh a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait constitu\u00e9 sa liste de clients gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des contacts au sein de sa propre communaut\u00e9, aux m\u00e9dias sociaux et \u00e0 d\u2019autres moyens, et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas trouv\u00e9 ses clients aupr\u00e8s de Skylight[84]. Toutefois, Selvy a indiqu\u00e9 que Skylight envoyait occasionnellement \u00e0 Suresh des clients qui souhaitaient r\u00e9server un voyage[85]. Lors du contre-interrogatoire, interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ces clients envoy\u00e9s par Skylight, Suresh a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que cela se produisait \u00ab tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s rarement \u00bb[86].\n[94] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ci-dessus du syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de Suresh, bas\u00e9 sur la commission, de m\u00eame que sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 choisir et \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier le montant de la majoration des prix de base qu\u2019il obtenait de ses vendeurs et autres fournisseurs, sont des indications claires qu\u2019il avait la possibilit\u00e9 de tirer un profit. Ce facteur pointe vers un contrat ind\u00e9pendant.\n(8) Appr\u00e9cier, pond\u00e9rer et r\u00e9soudre [95] Les facteurs relatifs au contr\u00f4le, au risque de perte et \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de tirer un profit penchent sugg\u00e8rent fortement l\u2019existence d\u2019une relation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant entre Skylight et Suresh. Le facteur relatif au mat\u00e9riel et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipement pointe vers les deux directions, mais je crois qu\u2019il penche tout de m\u00eame un peu vers une relation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. Les facteurs relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019embauche d\u2019assistants et \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de mises de fonds et de gestion sont des facteurs neutres ou inapplicables.\n[96] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9, appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et pond\u00e9r\u00e9 les facteurs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Suresh a travaill\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9. En d\u2019autres termes, et tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, les facteurs pris en compte dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door sont compatibles avec la compr\u00e9hension mutuelle selon laquelle Suresh travaillait pour Skylight en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Suresh a exerc\u00e9 un travail aupr\u00e8s de Skylight qui ne constituait ni un emploi assurable, ni un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\nF. Statut de Titus\n[97] Conform\u00e9ment aux orientations fournies par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes, je commencerai par d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait une compr\u00e9hension mutuelle ou une intention commune entre Skylight et Titus concernant leur relation. Je me pencherai ensuite sur les facteurs d\u00e9finis dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette intention mutuelle (le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant) d\u00e9cider si, tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, les faits pertinents soutiennent cette intention et sont compatibles avec celle-ci ou, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019intention mutuelle, d\u00e9terminer si ces facteurs rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un emploi ou d\u2019un contrat ind\u00e9pendant.\n(1) Intention [98] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Selvy et l\u2019entente par lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 janvier 2015[87], Skylight avait l\u2019intention d\u2019engager Titus \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur. Bien que Titus ait reconnu avoir sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente par lettre, j\u2019ai l\u2019impression qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas bien compris la diff\u00e9rence entre un entrepreneur et un employ\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Titus a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait davantage soucieux de s\u2019assurer de pouvoir travailler seulement \u00e0 temps partiel et de pouvoir le faire \u00e0 partir de son domicile, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de travailler dans les locaux de Skylight[88].\n[99] Titus a expliqu\u00e9 en ces termes la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9tabli sa relation avec Skylight :\n[traduction] Me VANIER : D\u2019accord. Et j\u2019ai cru comprendre que vous vouliez reprendre vos activit\u00e9s dans le domaine du voyage.\nM. GEORGES : Oui, je -- je m\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 l\u2019industrie du voyage parce que la raison pour laquelle je -- comme je disais, j\u2019ai refait le -- avec mon travail \u00e0 temps partiel. Je ne veux pas d\u2019un emploi \u00e0 temps plein.\nMe VANIER : D\u2019accord. Comment la relation entre vous et Skylight a-t-elle commenc\u00e9?\nM. GEORGES : J\u2019ai connu la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un de mes amis, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils sont la seule -- communaut\u00e9 de voyage \u00e0 faire des affaires dans l\u2019industrie du voyage dans le sud de l\u2019Inde. Ce sont les seuls qui vont l\u00e0.\nMe VANIER : D\u2019accord. Les avez-vous approch\u00e9s en ayant un plan?\nM. GEORGES : Un de mes amis les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, et je les ai ensuite approch\u00e9s. Ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 m\u2019aider pour un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel.\nMe VANIER : Pouvez-vous me dire ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu?\nM. GEORGES : Je devais faire mes propres affaires. Ils devaient me donner une commission. Tel est l\u2019entente.\nMe VANIER : La r\u00e9partition de la commission a-t-elle fait l\u2019objet de nombreuses n\u00e9gociations?\nM. GEORGES : Ils me donnent 70 % de la commission, et je suis satisfait pour \u00e7a[89].\n[100] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Titus a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un employ\u00e9 de Skylight, mais il a ensuite dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel[90]. Ces d\u00e9clarations sont quelque peu d\u00e9routantes, car elles semblent indiquer que Titus n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas s\u00fbr de son statut ou, plus probablement (compte tenu des difficult\u00e9s linguistiques qu\u2019il rencontrait), qu\u2019il n\u2019avait peut-\u00eatre pas pleinement compris la signification des termes \u00ab entrepreneur \u00bb et \u00ab employ\u00e9 \u00bb[91]. N\u00e9anmoins, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un soup\u00e7on d\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, il semble que, dans l\u2019ensemble, Skylight et Titus aient compris mutuellement que Titus travaillait pour Skylight en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[101] En outre, je crois comprendre que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions et l\u2019agente des appels ont reconnu que Skylight et Titus avaient comme intention que Titus travaille en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant[92].\n(2) Contr\u00f4le [102] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Titus a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne tenait pas \u00e0 gagner beaucoup d\u2019argent, mais qu\u2019il souhaitait travailler \u00e0 temps partiel dans l\u2019industrie du voyage[93]. Titus a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il entretenait certaines relations gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son appartenance religieuse et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9tabli des relations d\u2019affaires gr\u00e2ce aux amiti\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait nou\u00e9es dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s au sein de son \u00e9glise. Titus ne faisait pas de publicit\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on active. Il trouvait plut\u00f4t de nouveaux clients gr\u00e2ce au bouche-\u00e0-oreille et \u00e0 l\u2019apport d\u2019autres clients satisfaits. Titus a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il beaucoup de clients r\u00e9guliers et de longue date[94].\n[103] Selvy a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune interdiction l\u00e9gale emp\u00eachant Titus de travailler pour quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre. En d\u2019autres termes, il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour d\u2019autres personnes[95]. Titus a assur\u00e9 qu\u2019il comprenait qu\u2019il avait la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler pour d\u2019autres agences de voyages que Skylight, mais que cela ne l\u2019int\u00e9ressait pas[96].\n[104] Titus effectuait la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de son travail \u00e0 partir de son domicile. Il ne se rendait au bureau que pour d\u00e9poser ses factures bihebdomadaires et, occasionnellement, pour rencontrer le personnel de Skylight ou les repr\u00e9sentants des compagnies a\u00e9riennes[97].\n[105] Titus fixait ses propres horaires, avait ses propres clients et travaillait quand il le souhaitait[98]. Titus n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 se rapporter \u00e0 Skylight, sauf lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9sentait ses factures pour obtenir les commissions qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9es[99].\n[106] Titus n\u2019avait pas d\u2019horaire fixe \u00e0 respecter pour le travail; il pouvait prendre des cong\u00e9s de maladie ou des vacances quand il le souhaitait, ou lorsqu\u2019il en avait besoin[100]. Titus pr\u00e9venait Skylight lorsqu\u2019il partait en vacances pour une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e[101].\n[107] Skylight a permis \u00e0 Titus de choisir le titre qu\u2019il souhaitait utiliser dans le cadre de ses fonctions aupr\u00e8s de Skylight. Il a choisi le titre de [traduction] \u00ab directeur des ventes \u00bb[102].\n[108] Titus a expliqu\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re typique dont ses clients faisaient appel \u00e0 ses services. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ils lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonaient, lui expliquaient qu\u2019ils souhaitaient planifier un voyage et lui en donnaient les d\u00e9tails. Souvent, ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le prix du vol qu\u2019ils souhaitent prendre. Titus proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 la r\u00e9servation du vol et en envoyait les d\u00e9tails \u00e0 un groupeur, qui \u00e9mettait ensuite les billets et les lui envoyait par courrier \u00e9lectronique. Apr\u00e8s quoi, Titus il transmettait les billets \u00e0 ses clients. Titus a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019environ 90 % de ses clients payaient leurs vols avec une carte de cr\u00e9dit et que leurs num\u00e9ros de cartes \u00e9taient introduits dans le syst\u00e8me SABRE au cours de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9servation. L\u2019ensemble du processus se d\u00e9roulait sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire que Titus soit en pr\u00e9sence de ses clients ou interagisse avec Skylight, si ce n\u2019est en utilisant le mot de passe fourni par Skylight pour acc\u00e9der au syst\u00e8me SABRE. Une fois la r\u00e9servation effectu\u00e9e et les billets \u00e9mis, Titus envoyait une facture \u00e0 Skylight pour lui facturer les 70 % de la commission qui devait lui \u00eatre vers\u00e9e par la compagnie a\u00e9rienne[103].\n[109] Skylight n\u2019avait pas d\u2019attentes financi\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Titus (si ce n\u2019est de percevoir les 30 % des commissions gagn\u00e9es par Titus qui lui revenaient). Skylight n\u2019imposait pas d\u2019objectifs financiers, d\u2019objectifs ou de crit\u00e8res de vente \u00e0 Titus, et ne proc\u00e9dait pas non plus \u00e0 des \u00e9valuations des performances de Titus[104].\n[110] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquent que Skylight n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas un contr\u00f4le sur Titus. Ce facteur pointe fortement vers le statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n(3) Mat\u00e9riel et \u00e9quipement [111] Skylight a fourni \u00e0 Titus un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 SABRE, des cartes de visite et une adresse \u00e9lectronique. Titus travaillait principalement depuis son domicile. Titus devait fournir son propre ordinateur, son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, son mobilier de bureau (qui se trouvait \u00e0 son domicile) et son v\u00e9hicule.\n[112] Titus n\u2019a pas eu \u00e0 effectuer de paiements \u00e0 Skylight pour l\u2019utilisation de SABRE, de son adresse \u00e9lectronique ou de ses cartes de visite. Au contraire, la compensation vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Skylight pour ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments provenait des 30 % des commissions gagn\u00e9es par Titus qui lui revenaient[105].\n[113] Skylight n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 Titus de fournitures de bureau[106].\n[114] Bien que ce facteur pointe dans les deux directions, il penche \u00e0 mon avis en faveur du statut d\u2019entrepreneur.\n(4) Embauche d\u2019assistants [115] Titus a avanc\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas confier son travail \u00e0 un tiers en sous-traitance, ni embaucher quelqu\u2019un pour l\u2019aider dans son travail[107].\n[116] Ce facteur pointe vers l\u2019emploi.\n(5) Risque de perte [117] Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, Titus a engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail, car il devait fournir son propre ordinateur portable, son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable, son mobilier de bureau et ses fournitures de bureau.\n[118] Titus a \u00e9galement d\u00fb payer les frais pour l\u2019examen du TICO, qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il venait de commencer \u00e0 travailler pour Skylight. Ces frais ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s par Skylight[108].\n[119] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Titus \u00e9tait tenu de payer les frais susmentionn\u00e9s et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que, certains mois ou certaines ann\u00e9es, ses frais d\u00e9passent ses revenus pour cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, il courait un risque de perte. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment plaide en faveur d\u2019un contrat ind\u00e9pendant.\n(6) Responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de mises de fonds et de gestion [120] Ce facteur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal et du contre-interrogatoire de Titus. Ce facteur est inapplicable.\n(7) Possibilit\u00e9 de tirer un profit [121] Bien que Titus n\u2019ait pas fait de publicit\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9dias imprim\u00e9s ou num\u00e9riques, il a travaill\u00e9 dur pour d\u00e9velopper sa client\u00e8le. Il trouvait ses clients principalement par le biais de contacts personnels et en entretenant de bonnes relations avec ses parents, ses amis, les membres de son \u00e9glise et d\u2019autres personnes avec lesquelles il \u00e9tait en contact. Titus fr\u00e9quentait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement trois congr\u00e9gations religieuses \u00e0 Toronto et une quatri\u00e8me \u00e0 Niagara. Il se liait d\u2019amiti\u00e9 avec les personnes qu\u2019il rencontrait, organisait des voyages pour elles; ces personnes parlaient ensuite de ses services de voyage \u00e0 leurs connaissances[109]. Titus a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des contacts avec ses clients lui-m\u00eame, et non par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Skylight[110]. Titus tenait \u00e0 jour une liste manuscrite de ses clients (il s\u2019agissait en fait d\u2019un livre dans lequel il consignait les informations relatives \u00e0 ses clients)[111], qu\u2019il aurait pu emporter avec lui s\u2019il avait quitt\u00e9 Skylight[112].\n[122] Titus a expliqu\u00e9 que dans d\u2019autres relations d\u2019entrepreneur dont il avait connaissance, certaines agences de voyages partageaient les commissions avec leurs entrepreneurs selon un ratio de 50-50 % ou de 60-40 % (en faveur de l\u2019entrepreneur)[113]. Toutefois, dans son cas, Titus a compris qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 70 % des commissions qu\u2019il g\u00e9n\u00e9rait, tandis que Skylight en recevait 30 %[114]. Le fait que le ratio de partage des commissions applicable \u00e0 Titus \u00e9tait plus avantageux pour lui que le ratio offert dans de nombreuses autres positions, et le fait que le montant des commissions per\u00e7ues d\u00e9pendait du temps et des efforts qu\u2019il consacrait au d\u00e9veloppement de sa client\u00e8le et \u00e0 d\u2019autres aspects de son travail, indiquent qu\u2019il avait la possibilit\u00e9 de tirer un profit.\n[123] Ce facteur pointe fortement vers un statut d\u2019entrepreneur.\n(8) Appr\u00e9cier, pond\u00e9rer et r\u00e9soudre [124] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les facteurs relatifs au contr\u00f4le, au risque de perte et \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de tirer profit penchent sugg\u00e8rent fortement l\u2019existence d\u2019une relation d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant entre Skylight et Titus. Le facteur relatif \u00e0 l\u2019embauche d\u2019assistants indique qu\u2019il existait une relation employeur-employ\u00e9 entre Skylight et Titus. Bien que le facteur relatif au mat\u00e9riel et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipement pointe dans les deux directions, il penche en faveur du statut d\u2019entrepreneur. Le facteur relatif \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de mises de fonds et de gestion n\u2019est pas applicable dans cette situation.\n[125] En me basant sur mon examen des facteurs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que, dans l\u2019ensemble, ces facteurs soutiennent la position de Skylight et de Titus, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que ces facteurs sont compatibles avec la compr\u00e9hension mutuelle selon lequel Titus travaillait pour Skylight en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et non en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9. En outre, m\u00eame s\u2019il y avait un certain flou concernant la compr\u00e9hension par Titus de sa relation avec Skylight, tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, les facteurs d\u00e9crits dans les arr\u00eats Sagaz et Wiebe Door penchent en faveur du statut d\u2019entrepreneur. Par cons\u00e9quent, au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, Titus a exerc\u00e9 un travail aupr\u00e8s de Skylight qui ne constituait ni un emploi assurable, ni un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[126] Les appels sont accueillis; les cotisations concernant Suresh (qui font l\u2019objet des appels no 2019-443(EI) et no 2019-441(CPP)) sont annul\u00e9es; les cotisations concernant Titus (qui font l\u2019objet des appels no 2019-450(EI) et no 2019-451(CPP)) sont annul\u00e9es; les cotisations concernant Skylight (qui font l\u2019objet des appels no 2019-454(EI) et no 2019-456(CPP)) sont annul\u00e9es et sont renvoy\u00e9es au ministre pour r\u00e9examen et nouvelle cotisation, au motif que, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e :\n(a)ni Suresh ni Titus n\u2019exer\u00e7aient un emploi assurable ou ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension aupr\u00e8s de Skylight;\n(b)Selvy occupait un emploi ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, mais non assurable, aupr\u00e8s de Skylight;\n(c)Sheela et Akhill occupaient un emploi \u00e0 la fois assurable et ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension aupr\u00e8s de Skylight.\n[127] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ni les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi ni les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada ne pr\u00e9voient de d\u00e9pens, je ne rendrai aucune d\u00e9cision et n\u2019adjugerai aucuns d\u00e9pens en ce qui concerne les pr\u00e9sents appels.\n[128] Six avis d\u2019appel faisaient l\u2019objet de l\u2019instruction, \u00e0 savoir un avis d\u2019appel concernant l\u2019AE et un avis d\u2019appel concernant le RPC pour les appelants Skylight, Suresh et Titus. Ces avis d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par un agent, au nom des appelants, avant que ceux-ci n\u2019aient retenu les services d\u2019un avocat.\n[129] Selon la description de la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans chacun des six avis d\u2019appel que les droits des appelants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 atteints par la conduite d\u2019un employ\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC. La Cour \u00e9tait ainsi pri\u00e9e de leur accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au d\u00e9triment du ministre pour la conduite d\u00e9raisonnable de cet employ\u00e9. L\u2019octroi d\u2019une telle r\u00e9paration ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour; par cons\u00e9quent, je fais abstraction de cette demande particuli\u00e8re en r\u00e9paration. Bien que ce type de r\u00e9paration ne rel\u00e8ve pas de ma comp\u00e9tence, et malgr\u00e9 les lacunes des diff\u00e9rents rapports pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par les agentes (comme expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus), je souhaite noter que j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions et l\u2019agente des appels se sont montr\u00e9es courtoises et polies, de m\u00eame que sinc\u00e8res, respectueuses et mod\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la mani\u00e8re dont elles ont abord\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur emploi. Ces commentaires ne sont destin\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 exprimer mon impression de l\u2019agente des d\u00e9cisions et de l\u2019agente des appels relativement \u00e0 leur comparution en tant que t\u00e9moins dans l\u2019instruction de ces appels. Si les appelants d\u00e9cident d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant et de pr\u00e9senter leur demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats devant une Cour ayant la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour accorder une telle r\u00e9paration, les commentaires que j\u2019exprime dans le pr\u00e9sent paragraphe ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme traitant de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit des preuves ou des questions susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soumises \u00e0 cette cour.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 28e jour de f\u00e9vrier 2024.\n\u00ab Don R.

L\u2019avocate du ministre n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 quel avis d\u2019appel elle faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence; toutefois, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit probablement de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des deux avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9crits dans la pr\u00e9sente note de bas de page, voire des deux.

LES FAITS PERTINENTS\nA. Mise en contexte\n[7] L\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse, Andr\u00e9a Castro (ci-apr\u00e8s, \u00ab les Castro \u00bb), sont des inscrits en vertu de la partie IX de la LTA.\n[8] Le 27 avril 2010, ils acqui\u00e8rent de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Concordia un immeuble situ\u00e9 au 1463, rue Bishop, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab l\u2019immeuble \u00bb) pour la somme de 3 250 000,00 $. L\u2019immeuble est utilis\u00e9 comme centre administratif, mais les Castro d\u00e9sirent entreprendre des r\u00e9novations majeures afin d\u2019y am\u00e9nager trente-deux (32) unit\u00e9s de logement locatif.\n[9] \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, les Castro sont administrateurs et d\u00e9tiennent chacun cinquante pour cent (50%) des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, constitu\u00e9e le 12 avril 2010. Celle-ci n\u2019a pas d\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale et n\u2019est pas inscrite en vertu de la LTA.\n[10] Ayant d\u00e9but\u00e9 le projet de r\u00e9novation de l\u2019immeuble, les Castro ont besoin de financement additionnel afin de pouvoir poursuivre les travaux et c\u2019est dans ce contexte qu\u2019ils acceptent une lettre d\u2019offre de financement dat\u00e9e du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2011 (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab lettre d\u2019offre \u00bb) de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Capital Corporation (\u00ab Capital \u00bb), un pr\u00eateur priv\u00e9, pour un pr\u00eat de 3 400 000,00 $.\n[11] Selon les dispositions de la lettre d\u2019offre, le pr\u00eat doit \u00eatre garanti par une hypoth\u00e8que de premier rang sur l\u2019immeuble, par un certain nombre d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques collat\u00e9rales et par un cautionnement personnel de l\u2019appelant et de son \u00e9pouse de 1 000 000 $ chacun. Il est pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019immeuble doit \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que les actions avec droit de vote de celle-ci, alors d\u00e9tenues par les Castro, doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une mise en gage au profit de Capital.\n[12] La lettre d\u2019offre pr\u00e9voit que la prise de garantie, la cession de l\u2019immeuble et le d\u00e9boursement des fonds doivent \u00eatre faits devant le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Capital et que les travaux doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9galement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par Capital ou ses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s affili\u00e9es.\n[13] Par acte de cession notari\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012, les Castro c\u00e8dent l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la somme de 1,00 $ (ci-apr\u00e8s la \u00ab cession \u00bb).\n[14] En vertu du contrat de cession pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9, l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse d\u00e9clarent que l\u2019immeuble est utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 titre r\u00e9sidentiel, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures, qu\u2019aucun cr\u00e9dit de taxe sur les intrants n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 son acquisition, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la vente est exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de taxes. \u00c0 cette m\u00eame date, les documents de garantie sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, dont l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que mobili\u00e8re avec d\u00e9possession des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de Capital.\n[15] Cependant, le projet de r\u00e9novation conna\u00eet maintes difficult\u00e9s. Capital entame une proc\u00e9dure pour la vente en justice de l\u2019immeuble tandis que les Castro entament une poursuite en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il y a \u00e9ventuellement un r\u00e8glement et le tout se solde par une entente sign\u00e9e le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013 selon laquelle les Castro c\u00e8dent leurs actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par Capital et ses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s affili\u00e9es, pour la somme de 1,00 $. En \u00e9change, ils sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9s des garanties donn\u00e9es en vertu de la lettre d\u2019offre, dont les cautionnements personnels de 1 000,000 $. Quelque temps plus tard, ils signent une quittance en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, laquelle est homologu\u00e9e par la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec le 5 mai 2016.\nB. La cotisation pour la taxe non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e\n[16] Entre-temps, le ministre entame une v\u00e9rification et conclut que la cession \u00e9tait une fourniture taxable puisque l\u2019immeuble ne servait pas \u00e0 des fins r\u00e9sidentielles et les r\u00e9novations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment avanc\u00e9es pour permettre une telle utilisation. Le ministre conclut donc que les Castro, \u00e0 titre d\u2019inscrits, devaient percevoir la taxe calcul\u00e9e sur la juste valeur marchande de l\u2019immeuble au moment de la cession, et ce en vertu du paragraphe 221(1) de la LTA.\n[17] Une cotisation est \u00e9tablie le 10 novembre 2016 pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la taxe que les Castro \u00e9taient tenus de d\u00e9clarer dans leur d\u00e9claration trimestrielle, soit une taxe de 85 050,00 $ chacun, excluant le montant de la taxe provinciale (TVQ). Cette cotisation est port\u00e9e en appel devant la pr\u00e9sente Cour dans le dossier 2017-4748(GST)G. Cependant, un avis de d\u00e9sistement est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 2 mars 2020, mettant ainsi fin au litige. Il en est de m\u00eame de la cotisation pour la TVQ.\nC. Les d\u00e9marches pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la taxe non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e\n[18] Ayant re\u00e7u la cotisation du 10 novembre 2016, les Castro entreprennent des d\u00e9marches, \u00e0 titre de mandataires du ministre, pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la TPS-TVQ relativement \u00e0 la cession de l\u2019immeuble le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012.\n[19] Cependant, ces d\u00e9marches sont infructueuses. Les procureurs de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soutiennent que la demande de remboursement est frivole puisque \u00ab le contrat notari\u00e9 \u00e9tait un acte authentique faisant preuve que (\u2026) le transfert de l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est une fourniture exon\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb. Les Castro re\u00e7oivent une derni\u00e8re lettre le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2018, rejetant leur demande et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019ils arrivent \u00e0 la conclusion que la cr\u00e9ance est irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[20] Dans sa d\u00e9claration de TPS pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant d\u00e9duit de sa taxe nette la somme de 81 250,00 $, soit le montant de la cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[21] En \u00e9tablissant la cotisation du 30 novembre 2018 dont il est ici question, le ministre a refus\u00e9 de donner droit \u00e0 la demande de rajustement pour ladite cr\u00e9ance.\nD. La perte en capital d\u00e9coulant de la vente des actions\n[22] Ayant conclu qu\u2019ils avaient subi une perte en capital \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la juste de valeur marchande des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en raison de la transaction du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013 et de la quittance du 19 avril, 2016, l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse entreprennent des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence de revenu du Qu\u00e9bec pour qu\u2019elle reconnaisse la perte en capital relativement \u00e0 la cession des actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Au mois de mars 2018, Revenu Qu\u00e9bec reconna\u00eet que l\u2019appelant et sa conjointe ont subi une perte en capital de 1 780 777 $.\nV. ANALYSE\n[23] Avant qu\u2019un contribuable puisse demander une d\u00e9duction pour une cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable en vertu de l\u2019article 231 de la LTA, certaines conditions doivent \u00eatre remplies. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les conditions suivantes, telles que pr\u00e9vues aux paragraphes 231(1) et 231(1.1) de la LTA, font l\u2019objet d\u2019un diff\u00e9rend entre les parties:\nLes deux parties \u00e0 la transaction n\u2019ont aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance;\nTout ou une partie de la contrepartie et de la taxe est devenu irr\u00e9couvrable;\nLa taxe percevable relativement \u00e0 la fourniture est incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette dans la d\u00e9claration qui est produite pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration au cours de laquelle la taxe est devenue percevable;\nLa totalit\u00e9 de la taxe nette \u00e0 verser selon cette d\u00e9claration est vers\u00e9e.\n[24] Ces conditions sont toutes obligatoires et cumulatives, de sorte que le non-respect de l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles constitue un obstacle \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction en question : Equinox Realty Ltd. c.

Le lien de d\u00e9pendance\n[25] Selon l\u2019appelant, la cession de l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait une condition essentielle de la lettre d\u2019offre de financement donnant lieu \u00e0 un contrat de pr\u00eat.\n[26] Puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s d\u2019effectuer la cession et \u00ab de consentir une hypoth\u00e8que mobili\u00e8re avec d\u00e9possession sur les actions \u00bb, les Castro soutiennent qu\u2019ils ont perdu le contr\u00f4le de droit et de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s \u00ab de leurs v\u00e9ritables pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels et donc de leur contr\u00f4le effectif au sein m\u00eame de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00bb\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie que les Castro aient perdu le contr\u00f4le de droit ou le contr\u00f4le de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient actionnaires majoritaires au moment de la cession et la convention de pr\u00eat pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019ils conservaient leur droit de vote et leur droit aux dividendes. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00ab il subsistait un lien de d\u00e9pendance entre l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur et le fournisseur lors de la vente du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012 \u00bb au sens des paragraphes 126(1) et 126(2) de la LTA et l\u2019appelant \u00ab n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 repousser la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 251(1) de la Loi sur les imp\u00f4ts \u00e0 l\u2019effet que des personnes li\u00e9es sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es avoir entre elles un lien de d\u00e9pendance. \u00bb\n[28] Pour d\u00e9terminer si des personnes sont li\u00e9es, le paragraphe 126(1) de la LTA pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab les personnes li\u00e9es sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es avoir entre elles un lien de d\u00e9pendance \u00bb. Le paragraphe 126(2) pr\u00e9voit ensuite que les paragraphes 251(2) \u00e0 (6) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (L.R.C. (1985), ch.

Ils constituent donc un groupe li\u00e9 au sens du paragraphe 251(4) de la LIR.\n[31] Selon la jurisprudence, si la Cour devait conclure que des personnes sont li\u00e9es, cette disposition cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption \u00ab irr\u00e9futable \u00bb ou m\u00eame \u00ab irr\u00e9fragable \u00bb qu\u2019ils ont un lien de d\u00e9pendance : Simard c.

[2004] A.C.I. no 2004 (par. 9) (d\u00e9cision \u00ab Lash \u00bb).\n[32] Ainsi, si l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse contr\u00f4laient la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ensemble ou individuellement, ils \u00e9taient tous deux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au sens de la loi.\n[33] La notion de \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 revue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Besse Syndics inc. c. Canada, 2021 CAF 115, o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[22] Les crit\u00e8res de contr\u00f4le de droit et de contr\u00f4le de fait visent tous deux \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelle personne exerce un contr\u00f4le sur la composition du conseil d'administration d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et donc sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame (Buckerfield\u2019s Limited c. Minister of National Revenue, 1964 CanLII 1187 (CA EXC), 64 DTC 5301 [Buckerfield\u2019s Limited]; Silicon Graphics au par. 67). [...]\n[23] La diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux crit\u00e8res se limite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des facteurs pouvant \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration afin de d\u00e9terminer qui contr\u00f4le une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e (McGillivray aux par. 47 et 48). Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le contr\u00f4le de droit r\u00e9side entre les mains de ceux ou celles qui ont le pouvoir de nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce sont les actionnaires majoritaires. Cependant, certains documents peuvent modifier ou restreindre leur pouvoir. L\u2019analyse du contr\u00f4le de droit porte ainsi sur toute restriction interne \u2013 dans les actes constitutifs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou dans une convention unanime des actionnaires \u2013 au pouvoir de ces actionnaires d\u2019\u00e9lire les membres du conseil d\u2019administration ou de limiter la capacit\u00e9 du conseil d\u2019administration de g\u00e9rer les affaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. c. Canada, 1998 CanLII 827 (CSC), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 795 [Duha Printers] aux par. 36 et 37 (\u2026)\n(Non surlign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[34] Cette d\u00e9cision confirme que le contr\u00f4le de droit r\u00e9side entre les mains des personnes qui peuvent nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse. \u00c0 mon avis, le contrat de pr\u00eat et la mise en gage des actions ne peuvent constituer des documents pouvant modifier ou restreindre leur pouvoir de nommer les membres du conseil d\u2019administration.\n[35] Tel que l\u2019enseignent les professeurs Aurore Benadiba et Jacques Deslauriers dans \u00ab Titre II \u2013 Les hypoth\u00e8ques conventionnelles \u00bb, Les s\u00fbret\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec, 2e \u00e9d., Montr\u00e9al (QC), Wilson Lafleur, 2018, 295, \u00e0 la page 399 :\n1120. Le d\u00e9biteur conserve le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le bien gag\u00e9 (art. 2733 C.c.Q.). Par exemple, m\u00eame en les hypoth\u00e9quant avec d\u00e9possession, un actionnaire conserve la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses actions. Les restrictions auxquelles est assujetti le transfert de certaines actions ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00e0 leur mise en gage, le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019en \u00e9tant pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9. De l\u00e0 le maintien du droit de vote du d\u00e9biteur qui aurait donn\u00e9 des actions en gage \u00e0 moins que la dette ne soit pour le prix d\u2019acquisition de ces actions et que le contrat de vente ne contienne une clause \u00e0 cet effet.\n(Non surlign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[36] Le contr\u00f4le de fait n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 cette analyse et donc il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de savoir si Capital avait \u00ab une influence directe ou indirecte dont l\u2019exercice entra\u00eenerait le contr\u00f4le de fait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb, selon les termes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 256(5.11) de la LIR.\n[37] En d\u00e9pit du contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 par Capital, comme relat\u00e9 par les Castro lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, la Cour doit conclure que ces derniers constituaient un groupe li\u00e9 puisqu\u2019ils poss\u00e9daient 100% des actions avec droit de vote de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils \u00e9taient ainsi tous deux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 251(2)b)(ii) de la LIR.\n[38] Ils sont donc r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir un lien de d\u00e9pendance avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 126 de la LTA et cette conclusion suffit, \u00e0 elle seule, pour disposer de l\u2019appel. Je vais n\u00e9anmoins revoir les conditions restantes.\nB. La cr\u00e9ance jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable\n[39] L\u2019appelant maintient que la taxe nette qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb percevoir au moment de la cession et qu\u2019il a reconnue par l\u2019avis de d\u00e9sistement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le dossier d\u2019appel 2017-4748(GST)G est devenue irr\u00e9couvrable et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en droit de la radier de ses livres comptables pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e.\n[40] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019admet pas que la dette \u00e9tait irr\u00e9couvrable, la Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse n\u2019avaient pas \u00e0 \u00e9puiser toutes les voies de recours contre Capital pour conclure que la cr\u00e9ance \u00e9tait bel et bien irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[41] D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que les Castro avaient droit \u00e0 une perte en capital en raison de la cession de leurs actions pour une contrepartie de 1,00 $. La Cour est d\u2019avis que cela suffit pour conclure que la cr\u00e9ance en question \u00e9tait irr\u00e9couvrable au sens de l\u2019article 231 de la LTA.\nC. Les conditions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 231(1.1)\n[42] Les deux autres conditions sont pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 231(1.1) de la LTA, soit que la taxe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration pour la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e et que la taxe ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e.\n[43] Comme l\u2019indiqu\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions Equinox et 9267-9075 susmentionn\u00e9es, il s\u2019agit de conditions essentielles. Puisqu\u2019il la taxe nette exigible n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n[44] Le paragraphe 231(1) de la LTA vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir une situation o\u00f9 il y a une fourniture taxable et, selon la disposition, \u00ab tout ou une partie de la contrepartie et de la taxe payable \u00bb n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9 par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de la fourniture.\n[45] Si la cr\u00e9ance est jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9couvrable et radi\u00e9e de ses livres comptables, l\u2019inscrit peut demander une d\u00e9duction dans le calcul de sa taxe nette. Autrement dit, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019inscrit n\u2019est pas pay\u00e9, en tout ou en partie, et que la cr\u00e9ance est radi\u00e9e de ses livres comptables, il peut r\u00e9clamer un rajustement.\n[46] Cependant, le paragraphe 231(1.1) impose comme conditions que \u00ab la taxe percevable relativement \u00e0 la fourniture (\u2026) pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9claration au cours de laquelle la taxe est devenue percevable \u00bb soit incluse dans le calcul de la taxe nette et que \u00ab la totalit\u00e9 de la taxe nette \u00bb soit vers\u00e9e. En fin de compte, ces dispositions permettent \u00e0 l\u2019inscrit de r\u00e9clamer un remboursement de la taxe nette qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et vers\u00e9e, mais qui est devenue irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[47] Dans cette instance, les Castro ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mal avis\u00e9s quant \u00e0 leur obligation de percevoir la taxe lors de la cession du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2012. Ils n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la taxe nette et celle-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est que plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus tard, lorsque la cotisation pour la taxe percevable est devenue d\u00e9finitive, qu\u2019ils ont tent\u00e9 de recouvrer la cr\u00e9ance aupr\u00e8s de Capital, l\u2019actionnaire subs\u00e9quent de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[48] Je ne crois pas que le l\u00e9gislateur, en cr\u00e9ant la d\u00e9duction \u00e0 l\u2019article 231 de la LTA, souhaitait la rendre disponible aux inscrits qui se retrouvent dans la situation des Castro. Ajoutons \u00e0 cela que l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la d\u00e9duction aux situations semblables \u00e0 celle-ci pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences importantes. Il serait trop facile de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de payer la taxe s\u2019il suffisait de ne pas l\u2019inclure dans sa d\u00e9claration et ensuite d\u2019attendre plusieurs ann\u00e9es que les autorit\u00e9s fiscales \u00e9tablissent une cotisation, uniquement pour r\u00e9clamer une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 parce que le passage des ann\u00e9es a rendu la cr\u00e9ance irr\u00e9couvrable.\n[49] La situation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e par les Castro est certainement malencontreuse et il est manifeste qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 manipul\u00e9s par leur partenaire d\u2019affaires et mal avis\u00e9s par le notaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le pr\u00eateur. Malheureusement, l\u2019erreur de droit, quelle que soit sa source, ne peut constituer une justification valable pour donner droit \u00e0 la demande de rajustement en vertu du paragraphe 231(1) de la LTA.\n[50] Pour ces motifs, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 17e jour de janvier 2024.\n\u00ab Guy Smith \u00bb\nJuge Smith\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE:\n2024 CCI 3\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR:\n2021-1049(GST)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE:\nWILFREDO CASTRO ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nMontr\u00e9al (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE:\nLe 22 mars 2023\nMOTIFS DE JUGEMENT PAR:\nL'honorable juge Guy R.

Le ministre avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment accueilli cette demande en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 la cotisation de la d\u00e9claration de revenus 2006 de l\u2019appelant, telle que produite.\n[3] La p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2006 de l\u2019appelant a expir\u00e9 en 2010. Par cons\u00e9quent, le ministre s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle cotisation au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation.\n[4] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les deux questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont :\nEst-ce que le ministre pouvait invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle cotisation au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation?\nSi le ministre \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2006, est-ce que l\u2019appelant avait droit aux cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t demand\u00e9s pour les dons faits \u00e0 Mega Church?\nI. CONTEXTE\n[5] Vers 2006, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait m\u00e9canicien automobile et travaillait pour diff\u00e9rents concessionnaires automobiles dans le sud de l\u2019Ontario. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, il a \u00e9galement habit\u00e9 diverses r\u00e9sidences dans le sud de l\u2019Ontario.\n[6] Lorsqu\u2019il a produit sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un don de bienfaisance d\u2019un montant de 6 000 $ fait \u00e0 Mega Church, et il a joint \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration un re\u00e7u fiscal d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par le donataire.\n[7] Au cours de chacune des trois ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant 2006, l\u2019appelant a fait des dons de bienfaisance qui \u00e9taient, dans l\u2019ensemble, comparables au don de 6 000 $ qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir fait \u00e0 Mega Church pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006. Le ministre a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelant, rejetant l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des d\u00e9ductions demand\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement pour dons de bienfaisance, principalement parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de fournir la preuve du transfert de fonds aux organismes de bienfaisance en question lors d\u2019une v\u00e9rification par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada de ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. (La pratique de l\u2019appelant consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer des dons d\u2019environ 6 000 $ dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, pour voir ensuite le ministre \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation et rejeter l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des d\u00e9ductions demand\u00e9es s\u2019est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de 2008 \u00e0 2010. Cependant, les d\u00e9tails concernant les dons d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pour cette p\u00e9riode et les raisons pour lesquelles le ministre a rejet\u00e9 ces demandes de cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties.)\n[8] Pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 2003 \u00e0 2006, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des revenus d\u2019emploi annuels compris entre 30 447 $ et 47 538 $, et un revenu net annuel compris entre 22 936 $ et 47 538 $.\nII. FARDEAU DE LA PREUVE\n[9] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le fardeau de la preuve incombe au ministre lorsque ce dernier veut se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une nouvelle cotisation au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Toutefois, lorsque le ministre s\u2019acquitte de ce fardeau et que le v\u00e9ritable fond du diff\u00e9rend porte sur le droit \u00e0 un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t demand\u00e9, le fardeau passe au contribuable en ce qui a trait aux montants demand\u00e9s : voir, par exemple, Calphin, 2015 CCI 158.\n[10] Lors de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant a pris la d\u00e9cision tactique de ne pr\u00e9senter aucune preuve au dossier, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce faisant, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant a pour ainsi dire limit\u00e9 l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant dans le pr\u00e9sent appel aux conclusions de la Cour quant \u00e0 savoir si le ministre avait le droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2006 de l\u2019appelant au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Cette situation s\u2019explique par le fait qu\u2019il incomberait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de prouver qu\u2019il a droit aux cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t si le ministre avait gain de cause sur la premi\u00e8re question; toutefois, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il r\u00e9pondait aux exigences pour demander un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour dons de bienfaisance au titre du paragraphe 118.1(3) de la LIR pour un don \u00e0 Mega Church.\nIII. \u00c9TABLISSEMENT D\u2019UNE NOUVELLE COTISATION APR\u00c8S LA P\u00c9RIODE NORMALE DE NOUVELLE COTISATION\n[11] Les dispositions pertinentes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR pr\u00e9voient :\n(4) Cotisation et nouvelle cotisation \u2013 Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition [\u2026] qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie [\u2026]. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants :\na) le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration :\n(i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi [\u2026].\n[12] Lorsque le ministre cherche \u00e0 invoquer une fausse d\u00e9claration du contribuable dans une d\u00e9claration de revenus qui l\u2019autoriserait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition en question, il doit d\u00e9montrer (i) qu\u2019il y a eu une fausse d\u00e9claration dans la d\u00e9claration de revenus et (ii) que la fausse d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 une n\u00e9gligence, \u00e0 une inattention ou \u00e0 une omission volontaire.\n[13] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le ministre a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que deux fausses d\u00e9clarations faites par l\u2019appelant dans sa d\u00e9claration de revenus de 2006 justifiaient d\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation pour cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. La premi\u00e8re fausse d\u00e9claration all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est la d\u00e9claration, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 9 du formulaire T1 de 2006 rempli par l\u2019appelant, d\u2019un don de bienfaisance de 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mega Church dans le but de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t. La deuxi\u00e8me fausse d\u00e9claration all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est l\u2019omission par l\u2019appelant d\u2019inclure le nom et l\u2019adresse de M. Nathaniel Okoroafor \u00e0 la case 490 du formulaire T1 de sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, afin d\u2019identifier le professionnel qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration.\n(1) D\u00e9duction pour un don de bienfaisance de 6 000 $ dans le formulaire de d\u00e9claration T1\n[14] Le principal argument avanc\u00e9 par le ministre pour justifier l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation est que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettent de conclure que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a fait aucun paiement \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church en 2006. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon cet argument, l\u2019appelant a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire en d\u00e9clarant dans le formulaire T1 de sa d\u00e9claration de 2006 avoir fait un don de 6 000 $, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 aucun paiement ou fait d\u2019autre contribution \u00e0 l\u2019entit\u00e9 en question au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[15] Lors de l\u2019audience, peu de preuves directes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es concernant les paiements sur lesquels l\u2019appelant s\u2019appuyait pour justifier sa r\u00e9clamation au titre d\u2019un don de 6 000 $ fait \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006. Les quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par l\u2019appelant, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure engag\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[16] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant, il se serait rendu \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, accompagn\u00e9 de son fr\u00e8re, dans les locaux de Mega Church en 2006; chaque fois, il aurait fait un don au pasteur en lui donnant une traite bancaire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church.\n[17] Lorsque j\u2019ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant, j\u2019ai eu l\u2019impression qu\u2019il n\u2019avait probablement pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire dans les jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019audience par rapport aux dons faits \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter que son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 relater avec pr\u00e9cision certains d\u00e9tails secondaires soit imputable au passage du temps et \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas pris la peine de se rafra\u00eechir la m\u00e9moire. Par exemple, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir obtenu des re\u00e7us fiscaux de Mega Church au moment o\u00f9 \u00e9tait effectu\u00e9 chaque paiement, mais ce t\u00e9moignage est incompatible avec le fait qu\u2019il a joint \u00e0 sa d\u00e9claration de revenus de 2006 un seul re\u00e7u de Mega Church pour un montant total de 6 000 $. J\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 cette divergence en me basant sur le fait que l\u2019appelant aurait pu confondre, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, les re\u00e7us fiscaux d\u00e9livr\u00e9s par un organisme de bienfaisance et la copie d\u2019une traite bancaire d\u00e9tenue par l\u2019acheteur.\n[18] Cependant, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9soudre les incoh\u00e9rences dans le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant la fr\u00e9quence de ses visites dans les locaux de Mega Church, compte tenu de l\u2019impact que les diff\u00e9rentes versions auraient eu sur le nombre et la valeur nominale des traites bancaires achet\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant pour les dons faits \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006, et sur le nombre de fois o\u00f9 il aurait d\u00fb se rendre \u00e0 sa banque pour acheter ces traites.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u2019abord demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant cit\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins s\u2019il fr\u00e9quentait Mega Church chaque semaine; l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9pondu que ses visites n\u2019\u00e9taient pas hebdomadaires mais qu\u2019elles devaient probablement avoir lieu deux fois par mois. Cela correspond \u00e0 environ 24 visites \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006. Plus tard, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre rendu trois fois dans les locaux de Mega Church en 2006 et qu\u2019\u00e0 chaque fois, il avait fait un don de 2 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9glise au moyen d\u2019une traite bancaire. Cette version des faits est celle qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9e quasiment tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage. Toutefois, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a de nouveau parl\u00e9 de Mega Church, plus tard durant l\u2019interrogatoire, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019y rendait avec son fr\u00e8re tous les dimanches, ce qui correspondrait \u00e0 52 visites en 2006.\n[20] Si l\u2019appelant avait fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 Mega Church deux fois par mois, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 initialement, il y aurait eu 24 traites bancaires d\u2019une valeur moyenne de 250 $ chacune. Lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 Mega Church \u00e0 trois reprises en 2006, il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que trois traites bancaires d\u2019un montant de 2 000 $ chacune avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises. De plus, si l\u2019appelant avait fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 Mega Church chaque semaine, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par la suite, il y aurait eu 52 traites bancaires d\u2019un montant moyen de 115 $ chacune. Il est important de noter qu\u2019avant chacune de ses visites \u00e0 Mega Church, l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb se rendre \u00e0 sa banque pour acheter une traite bancaire en vue cette visite.\n[21] Je ne parviens pas \u00e0 comprendre comment il est possible que l\u2019appelant t\u00e9moigne de ses propres activit\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et que, dans le m\u00eame t\u00e9moignage, il apporte des preuves qui sugg\u00e8rent des versions diff\u00e9rentes des m\u00eames \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Selon l\u2019une des versions, il se serait rendu \u00e0 sa banque \u00e0 52 reprises pour acheter chaque fois une traite bancaire d\u2019une valeur d\u2019environ 115 $ et, selon une autre version, il s\u2019y serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 trois reprises pour acheter une traite bancaire d\u2019environ 2 000 $. Pour cette raison, j\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant ses visites \u00e0 Mega Church et les dons qu\u2019il aurait faits \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de l\u2019\u00e9glise n\u2019est ni cr\u00e9dible ni fiable.\n[22] Bien que je rejette le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant sa participation et ses dons \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 pour les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es, je ne suis pas convaincu que le rejet du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant la remise de traites bancaires \u00e0 Mega Church soit suffisant pour me permettre de conclure que le ministre a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9 de paiements totalisant 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006.\n[23] Je reconnais qu\u2019il y a certains d\u00e9fis suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 relever en mati\u00e8re de preuve lorsqu\u2019on tente de prouver l\u2019inexistence d\u2019un fait \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence que les paiements qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s ne l\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 mais je pense que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait la possibilit\u00e9, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de pr\u00e9senter des preuves prima facie d\u00e9montrant que l\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas pu faire un don \u00e0 Mega Church totalisant 6 000 $ en 2006, en se basant sur une analyse de ses sources de financement connues et de ses d\u00e9penses probables pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, ce qui est similaire \u00e0 l\u2019approche employ\u00e9e par le ministre dans le cas d\u2019une cotisation de valeur nette. Peut-\u00eatre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne disposait pas des donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9parer une telle analyse, mais quelle qu\u2019en soit la raison, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour aucune preuve appuyant la version du ministre sur la situation financi\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant en 2006 et sur l\u2019improbabilit\u00e9 que ce dernier ait pu faire des dons \u00e0 Mega Church totalisant 6 000 $ cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a produit en preuve des donn\u00e9es financi\u00e8res tir\u00e9es des d\u00e9clarations de revenus de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es 2001 \u00e0 2011 et a invit\u00e9 la Cour \u00e0 tenir compte des constantes en mati\u00e8re de dons de bienfaisance pouvant \u00eatre observ\u00e9es dans ces d\u00e9clarations pour \u00e9tayer sa conclusion voulant que l\u2019appelant n\u2019ait pas remis des traites bancaires totalisant 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention de la Cour sur le fait que le montant de 6 000 $ d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant comme un don \u00e0 Mega Church pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006 repr\u00e9sentait 12,62 % du revenu net de l\u2019appelant pour cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition et que, par exemple, les dons de bienfaisance d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2005 (qui ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s par le ministre) repr\u00e9sentaient entre 17,77 % et 26,16 % du revenu net de l\u2019appelant pour ces ann\u00e9es-l\u00e0. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 examiner ces donn\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019il les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve et lors de sa plaidoirie. De toute \u00e9vidence, il ne s\u2019agit pas en soi d\u2019une preuve appuyant directement la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019acheter des traites bancaires totalisant un montant de 6 000 $ pour en faire don \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le montant des dons de bienfaisance d\u00e9clar\u00e9s en 2006 et des dons importants d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pour les autres ann\u00e9es \u00e9tait toujours consid\u00e9rablement inf\u00e9rieur au revenu net de l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en question. \u00c0 mon avis, les mesures statistiques du ratio entre les dons de bienfaisance effectu\u00e9s au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e par rapport au revenu net de cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e sont des outils de v\u00e9rification utiles pour permettre au ministre d\u2019identifier les contribuables qui sont susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le plus rigoureux de leurs dons de bienfaisance. Toutefois, si ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 cherchait finalement \u00e0 prouver \u00e9tait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas avoir les ressources financi\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires pour effectuer les paiements aux organismes de bienfaisance, il lui fallait alors pr\u00e9senter plus de preuves quant \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des revenus de l\u2019appelant en 2006 et exclure la possibilit\u00e9 que celui-ci ait eu d\u2019autres sources de financement non imposables lui permettant d\u2019effectuer les dons.\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a \u00e9galement invit\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir compte du fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas produit de copies des traites bancaires ou des relev\u00e9s bancaires pertinents lors de l\u2019audience, et \u00e0 tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que ces documents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a surtout insist\u00e9 sur le fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas produit de copies des traites bancaires achet\u00e9es en 2006 et \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church. Il a aussi soulign\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019ARC avait envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, en 2006, une correspondance exigeant la preuve du paiement des dons dans le cadre de sa v\u00e9rification des dons de bienfaisance d\u00e9clar\u00e9s pour 2003, 2004 et 2005 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il devait obtenir ou conserver des copies de toutes les traites bancaires achet\u00e9es en 2006 dans le but de faire des dons \u00e0 Mega Church. Je pr\u00e9sume que le souhait de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait que je tire les conclusions d\u00e9favorables suivantes : (i) les copies des traites bancaires \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites en raison du fait qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9es; et (ii) les relev\u00e9s bancaires pertinents de 2006 ne contiennent aucune entr\u00e9e correspondant \u00e0 l\u2019achat de traites bancaires payables \u00e0 Mega Church. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 de tirer ces conclusions d\u00e9favorables dans les circonstances. Tout d\u2019abord, la jurisprudence \u00e9tablit qu\u2019une conclusion d\u00e9favorable ne doit \u00eatre tir\u00e9e que si la partie \u00e0 laquelle incombe le fardeau de la preuve pr\u00e9sente une preuve prima facie (voir : Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 6e \u00e9d., Toronto, ON : Lexis Nexis Canada, Inc., 2022, par. 6.511). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il incombait au ministre de prouver que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas pu faire des dons \u00e0 Mega Church pour un montant total de 6 000 $ en 2006; pourtant, je ne pense pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie appuyant cette th\u00e8se. En second lieu, il serait inappropri\u00e9 de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable dans des circonstances o\u00f9 la partie au d\u00e9triment de laquelle cette conclusion serait tir\u00e9e peut expliquer de fa\u00e7on cr\u00e9dible pourquoi la preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019explication de l\u2019appelant est que les documents n\u2019existent pas parce qu\u2019il ne les a pas conserv\u00e9s et parce que les banques ne conservent pas les donn\u00e9es et documents aussi longtemps. Je serais plus enclin \u00e0 rejeter la raison donn\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant pour n\u2019avoir pas conserv\u00e9 ou obtenu les documents bancaires si l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait en mesure de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a eu correspondance avec l\u2019appelant concernant la preuve du paiement du don de bienfaisance d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en 2006, qui a d\u00fb avoir lieu bien avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle les banques \u00e9taient cens\u00e9es conserver des traces des transactions de leurs clients effectu\u00e9es en 2006. Cependant, telle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la nature de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour appuyer son argument voulant que l\u2019appelant [traduction]\u00ab a[it] \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant \u00bb. Je ne consid\u00e8re donc pas que la correspondance de l\u2019ARC relative \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des d\u00e9clarations de 2003, 2004 et 2005 justifie de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas produit de copies des traites bancaires pour attester du paiement de dons \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006.\n[26] Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de conclure que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a probablement pas vers\u00e9 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 parce que cette derni\u00e8re, de m\u00eame que tous les autres organismes de bienfaisance auxquels il a fait des dons entre 2003 et 2006, a vu son enregistrement \u00e0 titre d\u2019organisme de bienfaisance r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le ministre au cours des ann\u00e9es post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 2006. Je ne vois pas comment la r\u00e9vocation du statut d\u2019organisme de bienfaisance par le ministre, effectu\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour laquelle le don en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme remettant en question le fait que l\u2019appelant a effectu\u00e9 des paiements \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church ou de l\u2019un des autres organismes de bienfaisance auxquels il a dit avoir fait des dons entre 2003 et 2006. M\u00eame si l\u2019appelant savait que le ministre v\u00e9rifiait certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments en rapport avec ces entit\u00e9s avant la r\u00e9vocation de leur enregistrement en tant qu\u2019organisme de bienfaisance \u2013 et rappelons qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019indique que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait au courant \u2013 sa connaissance de ces informations pourrait nous renseigner sur les motivations qui l\u2019ont pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 faire les dons, mais pas sur l\u2019existence r\u00e9elle des paiements qu\u2019il aurait faits \u00e0 ces entit\u00e9s au cours des ann\u00e9es pour lesquelles les dons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s. L\u00e0 encore, il incombait au ministre de d\u00e9montrer que les paiements n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait que le ministre ait r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 le statut d\u2019organisme de bienfaisance de ces entit\u00e9s post\u00e9rieurement aux faits n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[27] Cependant, m\u00eame si je ne souscris pas aux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance de cette autre preuve, je suis amen\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la question en me penchant sur l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant ses visites \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006. Pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, j\u2019ai dit que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 fournir un compte rendu coh\u00e9rent de ses habitudes de transaction avec Mega Church pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006 m\u2019avait conduit \u00e0 rejeter son t\u00e9moignage comme preuve de la fr\u00e9quence de ses dons \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et du montant pay\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque fois. Toutefois, l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence de son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point \u00e0 une port\u00e9e bien plus grande. Pour n\u2019importe quel individu, 6 000 $ repr\u00e9sente une somme importante et il est inconcevable qu\u2019une personne puisse pr\u00e9tendre avoir effectu\u00e9 des transactions aupr\u00e8s de Mega Church et de sa banque pour des montants de cette ampleur sans se souvenir clairement si cela a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 trois, 24 ou 52 visites, ou si la valeur nominale des traites bancaires \u00e9tait de 2 000 $, 250 $ ou 115 $. M\u00eame si j\u2019\u00e9tais pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter certaines impr\u00e9cisions ou de petites incoh\u00e9rences dans les souvenirs de l\u2019appelant concernant ses visites \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et la remise de traites bancaires \u00e0 chacune de ces visites, j\u2019estime que le fait qu\u2019il ait donn\u00e9 des versions tout \u00e0 fait incoh\u00e9rentes de ses visites \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et, indirectement, de ses visites \u00e0 sa banque pour acheter des traites bancaires \u00e0 l\u2019intention de Mega Church, permet de conclure que le montant total des traites bancaires qu\u2019il a remises \u00e0 Mega Church ne pouvait pas \u00eatre 6 000 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas achet\u00e9 et remis des traites bancaires \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mega Church en 2006 pour un montant totalisant 6 000 $.\n[28] Ainsi, le ministre est en droit d\u2019invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR au titre de la fausse d\u00e9claration volontaire faite par l\u2019appelant dans le formulaire T1 de sa d\u00e9claration pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, o\u00f9 il indique avoir fait des dons totaux de 6 000 $ \u00e0 Mega Church en 2016.\nIV. D\u00c9FAUT D\u2019IDENTIFIER M. OKOROAFOR EN TANT QUE PROFESSIONNEL SP\u00c9CIALISTE EN D\u00c9CLARATIONS DE REVENUS SUR LE FORMULAIRE T1\n[29] Ayant \u00e9tabli ci-dessus que le ministre \u00e9tait en droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) de la LIR au motif que l\u2019appelant avait fait une fausse d\u00e9claration concernant le montant de son don \u00e0 Mega Church, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me pencher sur l\u2019argument secondaire du ministre, selon lequel il pouvait \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006 en raison du d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant d\u2019inscrire, \u00e0 la case 490 du formulaire T1 de 2006, le nom et l\u2019adresse du professionnel qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de revenus. Or, si j\u2019avais d\u00fb me pencher sur la question, j\u2019aurais conclu que le ministre ne pouvait pas s\u2019appuyer sur ce type de fausse d\u00e9claration pour justifier une nouvelle cotisation rejetant les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour dons de bienfaisance.\n[30] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, la case 490 du formulaire T1 de la d\u00e9claration 2006 ne pr\u00e9cise pas quelles sont les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une personne qui devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un \u00ab sp\u00e9cialiste en d\u00e9clarations de revenus professionnel \u00bb \u00e0 cette fin. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve concernant les qualifications professionnelles de M. Okoroafor et les \u00e9ventuelles indications fournies par l\u2019ARC pour remplir la case 490, dans son guide publi\u00e9 pour la production du formulaire T1 et de la d\u00e9claration de 2006. D\u00e8s lors, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il existe une base factuelle permettant de conclure que l\u2019appelant a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire en n\u2019inscrivant pas le nom et l\u2019adresse de M. Okoroafor \u00e0 la case 490.\n[31] Toutefois, m\u00eame si je devais conclure que l\u2019appelant a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire en n\u2019identifiant pas son sp\u00e9cialiste en d\u00e9clarations de revenus, j\u2019ai conclu que le sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4.01)a)(i) s\u2019appliquerait pour emp\u00eacher le ministre d\u2019invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelant au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rejeter la demande de cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour dons de bienfaisance relative \u00e0 un don fait \u00e0 Mega Church.\n[32] La version pertinente du sous-paragraphe 152(4.01)a)(i) est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n(4.01) Cotisation \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019applique l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) ou b) : Malgr\u00e9 les paragraphes [152](4) et [152](5), la cotisation, la nouvelle cotisation ou la cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019appliquent l\u2019un des alin\u00e9as (4)a) \u00e0 b.1) ou b.3) \u00e0 c) relativement \u00e0 un contribuable pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est raisonnable de consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elle se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na) en cas d\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (4)a) :\n(i) une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par le contribuable [\u2026] effectu\u00e9e par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire ou attribuable \u00e0 quelque fraude commise par le contribuable [\u2026] lors de la production de la d\u00e9claration ou de la communication de quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi [\u2026].\n[33] Ainsi, alors que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) \u00e9tablit les circonstances dans lesquelles le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour la d\u00e9claration du contribuable frapp\u00e9e de prescription, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4.01)a) limite la possibilit\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 une nouvelle cotisation en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) en exigeant que les modifications dans la nouvelle cotisation puissent \u00eatre raisonnablement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme se rapportant \u00e0 la fausse d\u00e9claration du contribuable. \u00c0 mon avis, le refus du ministre d\u2019accorder un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t au titre du don de bienfaisance fait \u00e0 Mega Church n\u2019est pas une modification qui peut \u00eatre raisonnablement consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme se rapportant au fait que l\u2019appelant a omis d\u2019indiquer le nom et l\u2019adresse de M. Okoroafor \u00e0 la case 490 du formulaire T1 de la d\u00e9claration de revenus produite par l\u2019appelant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006.\nV. DROIT AU CR\u00c9DIT D\u2019IMP\u00d4T POUR DONS DE BIENFAISANCE\n[34] Ayant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le ministre \u00e9tait en droit d\u2019invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 152(4)a) et d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2006 de l\u2019appelant au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, au motif que l\u2019appelant a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration au sujet de ses dons de bienfaisance pour 2006, je me pencherai maintenant sur la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant a droit \u00e0 un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour dons de bienfaisance en vertu du paragraphe 118.1(3) de la LIR pour le montant en cause.\n[35] Sur ce point, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a satisfait aux exigences et \u00e9tait en droit de demander le cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t en vertu du paragraphe 118.1(3) de la LIR pour un don fait \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006.\n[36] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour dire que le re\u00e7u non dat\u00e9 portant le num\u00e9ro 61833, d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant par Mega Church, n\u2019est pas conforme aux exigences prescrites par le paragraphe 3501(1) du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le re\u00e7u n\u2019indique pas le lieu o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 (comme pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3501(1)d)); en outre, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son don avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 sous forme de traites bancaires plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en esp\u00e8ces, le re\u00e7u ne porte ni les dates o\u00f9 les dons ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us ni une br\u00e8ve description des biens (comme pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3501(1)e.1)). En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118.1(2)a), un re\u00e7u pour don de bienfaisance qui ne contient pas les renseignements prescrits par le R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ne peut \u00eatre inclus dans la somme des dons pour lesquels un contribuable peut demander un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t en vertu du paragraphe 118.1(3), comme l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kueviakoe, 2021 CAF 64.\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait que le re\u00e7u de Mega Church ne r\u00e9ponde pas aux exigences du paragraphe 3501(1) du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est d\u00e9terminant et prive l\u2019appelant de son droit \u00e0 recevoir un cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t en vertu du paragraphe 118.1(3) pour tout don fait \u00e0 Mega Church en 2006 et attest\u00e9 par ce re\u00e7u.\nVI.

L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition le 10 novembre 2011 et le ministre a confirm\u00e9 ces cotisations le 25 mars 2013.\n[2] Dans son avis d\u2019appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 24 juin 2013, l\u2019appelant a soutenu ce qui suit :\na)pendant toutes les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, il \u00e9tait parent d\u2019accueil;\nb)il \u00e9tait un particulier et non une fiducie;\nc)dans le cadre de ses fonctions d\u2019aidant, il a re\u00e7u de la province de la Colombie-Britannique des prestations d\u2019aide sociale apr\u00e8s examen des ressources, des besoins ou du revenu;\nd)ces prestations qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues indirectement \u00e9taient vers\u00e9es au profit des enfants sous la garde de la province de la Colombie-Britannique;\ne)il n\u2019avait aucun lien avec les enfants;\nf)il n\u2019a pas per\u00e7u d\u2019allocations familiales ou de prestations similaires au nom des enfants;\ng)il a maintenu une r\u00e9sidence principale s\u00e9par\u00e9e pour son usage personnel, mais les enfants vivaient dans sa r\u00e9sidence principale;\nh)les prestations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es par la province \u00e9taient directement destin\u00e9es aux enfants;\ni)la province de la Colombie-Britannique lui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes dans son cas, que ces prestations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas imposables, et il a donc raisonnablement cru que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas;\nj)compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 tenir de livres ou de registres des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il engageait pour les enfants et en leur nom.\n[3] \u00c0 l\u2019audition du pr\u00e9sent appel, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait invoquer le paragraphe 81(1)(h) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, qui exon\u00e8re de l\u2019imp\u00f4t certaines prestations vers\u00e9es aux parents d\u2019accueil ou, si cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible, le principe de la pr\u00e9clusion au vu des d\u00e9clarations que lui avait faites la province de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[4] Le fait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019ait essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer aucune des hypoth\u00e8ses \u00e9mises par le ministre constitue ici un point important, tout comme le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas souhait\u00e9 t\u00e9moigner, malgr\u00e9 mes recommandations les plus vives; de plus, il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve documentaire pour appuyer son appel.\n[5] Il a appel\u00e9 son fr\u00e8re, David Brereton, \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 parent d\u2019accueil pendant quelques ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de 2002, et recevait des prestations mensuelles de la province de la Colombie-Britannique parce qu\u2019il accueillait des enfants \u00e0 risque qui vivaient dans sa r\u00e9sidence et dont il \u00e9tait responsable 24 heures par jour, sept jours par semaine. Il \u00e9tait parent d\u2019accueil au sens propre du terme. La situation dans laquelle s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 l\u2019appelant est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente, et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve apport\u00e9 par le fr\u00e8re n\u2019est tout simplement pas utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] En ce qui concerne l\u2019appelant, je dois m\u2019en remettre aux hypoth\u00e8ses de fait du ministre pour tirer les conclusions de fait, puisque l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de les r\u00e9futer, de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit.\n[7] Durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, l\u2019appelant a fourni des services d\u2019aidant \u00e0 des enfants \u00e0 risque, mais en tant que sous-traitant dans une ou plusieurs maisons lou\u00e9es par M. John Cole. M. Cole avait \u00e9tabli un contrat avec la province de la Colombie-Britannique pour fournir des services de logement et d\u2019aidant \u00e0 des enfants \u00e0 risque qui ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre plac\u00e9s dans une famille d\u2019accueil traditionnelle. M. Cole n\u2019a jamais v\u00e9cu dans ces maisons; il dirigeait essentiellement une entreprise et exploitait ces logements dans un but lucratif. \u00c0 ce titre, M. Cole utilisait un groupe de sept ou huit sous-traitants, dont l\u2019appelant faisait partie, pour fournir des services d\u2019aidant aux enfants \u00e0 risque. Les sous-traitants effectuaient au maximum deux quarts de travail de 12 heures par semaine pour lesquels ils \u00e9taient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s 250 $ \u00e0 300 $. M. Cole assumait les frais d\u2019alimentation et d\u2019autres d\u00e9penses diverses des sous-traitants lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient en service, et fournissait des locaux de repos au personnel. Il est important de noter que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9sid\u00e9 dans aucun de ces logements, et qu\u2019aucun des enfants \u00e0 risque n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9sid\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9sidence qui, durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, se situait 2557, rue Forbes \u00e0 Victoria (Colombie-Britannique).\n[8] Les paiements r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par M. Cole \u00e0 l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des paiements de prestations d\u2019aide sociale effectu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s examen des ressources, des besoins ou du revenu, et l\u2019appelant n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune prestation d\u2019aide sociale provenant directement du minist\u00e8re pour la garde des enfants. En sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019aidant, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a engag\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9pense li\u00e9e \u00e0 son travail de sous-traitant.\n[9] La partie pertinente de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est le paragraphe 81(1)(h) qui est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n(h) si le contribuable est un particulier (sauf une fiducie), une prestation d\u2019assistance sociale vers\u00e9e habituellement apr\u00e8s examen des ressources, des besoins et du revenu en vertu d\u2019un programme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provincial ou d\u2019un corps dirigeant autochtone (au sens de l\u2019article 2 de la Loi sur les allocations sp\u00e9ciales pour enfants), dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est re\u00e7ue directement ou indirectement par le contribuable au profit d\u2019un particulier donn\u00e9 (\u00e0 l\u2019exception de son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait ou d\u2019une personne qui lui est li\u00e9e ou qui est li\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait \u2013 si \u00e0 la fois\n(i) aucune allocation familiale en vertu de la Loi sur les allocations familiales ou une allocation semblable en vertu d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif provincial qui pr\u00e9voit le versement d\u2019une allocation semblable \u00e0 celle pr\u00e9vue par cette loi, n\u2019est payable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019autre particulier pour la p\u00e9riode pour laquelle la prestation d\u2019assistance sociale est pay\u00e9e,\n(ii) l\u2019autre particulier habite au lieu principal de r\u00e9sidence du contribuable, ou ce lieu est maintenu pour que ce particulier l\u2019utilise \u00e0 titre r\u00e9sidentiel tout au long de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e au sous-alin\u00e9a 81(1)(h)(i);\n[10] Pour que le paragraphe 81(1)(h) s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019aurais d\u00fb constater ce qui suit :\na)les paiements effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient des prestations d\u2019assistance sociale qui lui \u00e9taient vers\u00e9es, directement ou indirectement, au profit des enfants \u00e0 risque apr\u00e8s examen des ressources, des besoins ou du revenu;\nb)les jeunes \u00e0 risque n\u2019avaient aucun lien avec lui;\nc)aucune autre allocation familiale n\u2019\u00e9tait vers\u00e9e au profit des enfants \u00e0 risque au titre d\u2019aucun autre programme;\nd) les enfants r\u00e9sidaient dans la r\u00e9sidence principale de l\u2019appelant.\n[11] Il est clair que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire au premier et au quatri\u00e8me volet de l\u2019examen. Il n\u2019existe absolument aucune preuve montrant que les versements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s examen des ressources, des besoins ou du revenu. En fait, l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration journalier pour le travail qu\u2019il effectuait pour M. Cole. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve selon lequel aucun des enfants ne r\u00e9sidait dans sa r\u00e9sidence principale est \u00e9galement irr\u00e9fut\u00e9. Bien que l\u2019appelant ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son avis d\u2019appel qu\u2019il avait deux r\u00e9sidences principales, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019existe \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[12] L\u2019appelant invoque la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion, sugg\u00e9rant que le ministre devrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer que ce revenu est imposable car un repr\u00e9sentant de la province de la Colombie-Britannique lui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce revenu ne serait pas imposable. Dans le pr\u00e9sent avis d\u2019appel, il indique qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas tenu de livres ou de registres des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il engageait pour les enfants en raison de cette d\u00e9claration que la province lui avait faite. Il soutient que la Couronne est la Couronne, qu\u2019elle soit f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale, et donc que la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion s\u2019applique, bien que la d\u00e9claration ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un autre ordre de gouvernement.\n[13] Tout d\u2019abord, il n\u2019existe absolument aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, oral ou documentaire, montrant que l\u2019appelant a engag\u00e9 de quelconques d\u00e9penses pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 comme sous-traitant de M. Cole.\n[14] Ensuite, la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion n\u2019est tout simplement pas pertinente dans ce contexte. Dans l\u2019affaire Gallant c. la Reine, 2012 CCI 119, la juge Woods a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet de la question de la pr\u00e9clusion, en commen\u00e7ant au paragraphe 14 :\n[14] En l\u2019instance, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant affirme que les motifs de la pr\u00e9clusion en equity devraient s\u2019appliquer, car il y a eu une assertion inexacte de fait.\n[15] Il va de soi que la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion ne peut pas lier la Couronne en ce qui concerne la loi : Goldstein v The Queen, 96 DTC 1029 (CCI). Cette th\u00e9orie peut cependant s\u2019appliquer dans le cas d\u2019assertions inexactes de faits : Rogers v The Queen, 98 DTC 1365 (CCI).\n[16] L\u2019argument qui joue en faveur de l\u2019application de la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le fait que l\u2019ARC a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 tort \u00e0 l\u2019appelant que l\u2019article 118.61 serait appliqu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au formulaire. Pour autant que je sache, le formulaire n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9.\n[17] Il m\u2019est difficile d\u2019accorder une r\u00e9paration, car je dois tenir compte du principe primordial selon lequel la th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9clusion ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019exercice d\u2019une obligation pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Le principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9 par le juge suppl\u00e9ant Chevalier dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ludmer v The Queen, 1994 CanLII 19486 (FCA), 95 DTC 5311 (C.A.F.), \u00e0 la page 5314 :\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada v. Lidder, 1992 CanLII 14712 (FCA), [1992] 2 C. F. 621, monsieur le juge Marceau \u00e9crit (page 625) :\nOn ne saurait invoquer la th\u00e9orie de la fin de non-recevoir pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019exercice d\u2019une obligation pr\u00e9vue par la loi \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019obligation pour l\u2019agent de traiter la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u2013 ni pour conf\u00e9rer un statut d\u00e9fini par la loi \u00e0 une personne qui n\u2019est pas, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9finition l\u00e9gale. En fait, le bon sens dicterait qu\u2019on ne puisse omettre d\u2019appliquer la r\u00e8gle en raison de la d\u00e9claration fausse, de la n\u00e9gligence ou de la simple pr\u00e9sentation inexacte des faits de la part d\u2019un fonctionnaire gouvernemental.\nAu cours du d\u00e9bat, on a laiss\u00e9 entendre que si la th\u00e9orie de la fin de non\u2011recevoir ne pouvait s\u2019appliquer, la th\u00e9orie connexe de \u00ab l\u2019expectative raisonnable ou l\u00e9gitime \u00bb le pourrait peut-\u00eatre. Cette proposition \u00e9tait vaine parce que cette th\u00e9orie conna\u00eet la m\u00eame limite qui restreint la th\u00e9orie de la fin de non\u2011recevoir. Une autorit\u00e9 publique se trouve peut-\u00eatre li\u00e9e par ses engagements quant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019elle va suivre, mais elle ne peut en aucun cas se mettre en situation de conflit avec ses obligations et faire fi des exigences de la loi. Comme l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 le juge Sopinka lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame Renvoi relatif au R\u00e9gime d\u2019assistance publique du Canada (C.-B.), 2 R.C.S. 525, aux pages 557 et 558 :\nOr, ni la jurisprudence canadienne, ni celle d\u2019Angleterre, n\u2019appuient la position suivant laquelle la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019expectative l\u00e9gitime peut cr\u00e9er des droits fondamentaux. Cette th\u00e9orie fait partie des r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale auxquelles peuvent \u00eatre soumis les organismes administratifs. Dans les cas o\u00f9 elle s\u2019applique, elle peut faire na\u00eetre le droit de pr\u00e9senter des observations ou d\u2019\u00eatre consult\u00e9. Elle ne vient pas limiter la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 la suite de ces observations ou de cette consultation.\n[15] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il est \u00e9vident que le ministre ne peut \u00eatre tenu de d\u00e9clarer que le revenu qui est clairement imposable ne le soit pas en raison de la d\u00e9claration inexacte d\u2019un fonctionnaire d\u2019un autre ordre du gouvernement. En fait, le m\u00eame raisonnement s\u2019appliquerait si la d\u00e9claration inexacte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un fonctionnaire du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Comme le juge Sopinka l\u2019indique dans le Renvoi relatif au R\u00e9gime d\u2019assistance publique du Canada (C.-B.), [1991] 2 RCS 525, la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019expectative l\u00e9gitime n\u2019est pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de droits fondamentaux. L\u2019appelant s\u2019attendait peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 ce que le revenu gagn\u00e9 ne soit pas imposable, mais cela n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance. La question en litige est de savoir si l\u2019appelant satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans le paragraphe 81(1)(h), et j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu qu\u2019il ne le satisfait pas.\n[16] L\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des cotisations \u00e9tablies au titre de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2006, 2007, 2008 et 2009 de l\u2019appelant est donc rejet\u00e9.\n[17] Aucuns d\u00e9pens ne sont adjug\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Timmins, (Ontario), ce 9e jour d\u2019avril 2024.\n\u00ab Martin Lambert \u00bb\nLe juge suppl\u00e9ant Lambert\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 41\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2013-2415(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nJONATHAN A.

R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits\n[1] L\u2019appelant, Michael Persaud, interjette le pr\u00e9sent appel afin de demander une d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux du calcul de sa d\u00e9claration de revenus 2019 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux soins de sant\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pour Dennis Persaud, son p\u00e8re alors gravement malade.\n[2] Aucun fait n\u2019est contest\u00e9. Dennis Persaud, citoyen et r\u00e9sident guyanien, \u00e9tait au Canada avec un visa de visiteur et pr\u00e9voyait y passer environ 2 semaines, soit du 5 mai au 19 mai 2019. Au lieu de cela, Dennis Persaud a fait une crise cardiaque grave et est rest\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9 au Canada pendant environ 8 semaines, jusqu\u2019au 14 juillet 2019. Pendant sa convalescence au Canada, Dennis a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des soins m\u00e9dicaux actifs, puis des soins de r\u00e9adaptation. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas couvert pour ces co\u00fbts, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9sident du Canada au sens des lois canadiennes applicables en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9. Malheureusement, Dennis Persaud est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en novembre 2021.\n[3] Pour ceux qui pourraient penser que les soins de sant\u00e9 sont \u00ab gratuits \u00bb au Canada, les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux soins de sant\u00e9 de Dennis Persaud d\u00e9passaient 18 700 $. Ces co\u00fbts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9s par son fils d\u00e9vou\u00e9 et attentionn\u00e9, Michael Persaud. Michael Persaud a d\u00e9duit les co\u00fbts en tant que \u00ab montant admissible des frais m\u00e9dicaux pour d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 charge \u00bb (la \u00ab d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb). Le ministre a refus\u00e9 la demande, Michael Persaud s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9 et le ministre a confirm\u00e9 son refus.\nII. Disposition l\u00e9gislative\n[4] Plusieurs dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb) portent sur la d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux : l\u2019article 118.2 concerne la nature des frais m\u00e9dicaux et le paragraphe 118b) donne la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge pour laquelle un contribuable peut demander une d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux. La nature des frais m\u00e9dicaux est par ailleurs admissible, et le ministre ne conteste pas cette question.\n[5] Les extraits pr\u00e9cis de la LIR pertinents au pr\u00e9sent appel sont les suivants :\nPersonne \u00e0 charge \u2013 d\u00e9finition\n(6) Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)d), est une personne \u00e0 charge, relativement \u00e0 un particulier au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, la personne aux besoins de laquelle le particulier subvient \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e si elle est, par rapport au particulier ou \u00e0 son \u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait :\n[\u2026]\nb) son p\u00e8re ou sa m\u00e8re, son grand-p\u00e8re ou sa grand-m\u00e8re, son oncle ou sa tante, son fr\u00e8re ou sa s\u0153ur, son neveu ou sa ni\u00e8ce, qui r\u00e9side au Canada \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[6] Le contribuable doit remplir trois conditions en vue d\u2019obtenir la d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un tiers. D\u2019abord, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des traitements doit : avoir un lieu d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre (le \u00ab lien de parent\u00e9 \u00bb); \u00eatre \u00e0 la charge du contribuable (la \u00ab d\u00e9pendance \u00bb) et, s\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un \u00e9poux, d\u2019un conjoint de fait ou d\u2019un descendant, avoir un autre degr\u00e9 de parent\u00e9; et \u00eatre une personne \u00ab r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb (la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb).\nConclusions pr\u00e9liminaires et observations\nParent\u00e9\n[7] En ce qui concerne le lien de parent\u00e9, Dennis Persaud \u00e9tait le p\u00e8re de Michael Persaud. La premi\u00e8re condition est remplie dans les faits et en droit.\nD\u00e9pendance\n[8] Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9pendance, la Cour a conclu que Dennis Persaud \u00e9tait dans les faits enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9pendant de Michael Persaud au cours de son s\u00e9jour au Canada, ind\u00e9pendamment de la condition relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. Les montants vers\u00e9s pour assurer le traitement, l\u2019h\u00e9bergement et la r\u00e9adaptation de Dennis Persaud afin qu\u2019il puisse sortir de l\u2019h\u00f4pital et quitter le Canada \u00e9taient tous port\u00e9s au compte de Michael Persaud. Il n\u2019y a pas de jurisprudence pertinente qui porte sur la formulation l\u00e9g\u00e8rement \u00e9tapiste de \u00ab la personne aux besoins de laquelle le particulier subvient \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, comparativement au libell\u00e9 relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, soit \u00ab qui r\u00e9side au Canada \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb. La condition relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9pendance a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Le seul point litigieux est la condition relative \u00e0 la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb.\nIII. Les positions des parties\nR\u00e9sidence\n[9] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 peu de jurisprudence sur la question de la formulation relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(6)b), \u00e0 savoir une personne qui \u00ab r\u00e9side au Canada \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, en particulier en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une phrase identique ou similaire ailleurs dans la LIR et la jurisprudence qui pourrait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour a accord\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour la pr\u00e9sentation de br\u00e8ves observations ult\u00e9rieures. Les observations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues et la Cour peut rendre sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] Selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de Michael Persaud, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 118(6)b) signifie \u00ab une personne qui r\u00e9side l\u00e9galement au Canada \u00e0 tout moment entre le 1er janvier et le 31 d\u00e9cembre au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e \u00bb. Comme Dennis Persaud disposait d\u2019un visa l\u00e9gal d\u2019une dur\u00e9e maximale de six mois et qu\u2019il a s\u00e9journ\u00e9 environ huit semaines au Canada, cela constitue une r\u00e9sidence au Canada. \u00c0 ce titre, Dennis Persaud \u00e9tait un r\u00e9sident du Canada au moment de son s\u00e9jour de huit semaines pendant lequel des d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es.\n[11] \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le paragraphe 2(1) de la LIR, qui ordonne qu\u2019un imp\u00f4t soit \u00ab pay\u00e9 [\u2026] de toute personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, utilise la d\u00e9finition de la r\u00e9sidence en common law, sauf pour les r\u00e9sidents r\u00e9put\u00e9s. Ce crit\u00e8re incarne le concept de \u00ab r\u00e9sident habituel au Canada \u00bb.\nIV. Analyse\n[12] Pour ce qui est de la condition relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer, dans le contexte des d\u00e9ductions pour frais m\u00e9dicaux, \u00ab si \u00bb Denis Persaud \u00e9tait une personne \u00ab r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb.\nLa r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des mots r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s\n[13] Dans une loi du Parlement, on doit, si possible, donner \u00e0 des mots r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s un sens coh\u00e9rent dans l\u2019ensemble de la loi. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a affirm\u00e9 que \u00ab \u00e0 moins que le contexte ne s\u2019y oppose clairement, un mot doit recevoir la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation et avoir le m\u00eame sens tout au long d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif \u00bb[1]. En principe, un l\u00e9gislateur choisit avec soin et coh\u00e9rence les mots qu\u2019il emploie de sorte que les m\u00eames mots auront le m\u00eame sens, et que des mots diff\u00e9rents auront une signification diff\u00e9rente[1].[2]\n[14] L\u2019attribution d\u2019un sens semblable vaut en particulier lorsque les mots sont proches les uns des autres ou qu\u2019il existe un autre rapport entre eux[3]. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Thomson c. Canada (Sous-ministre de l\u2019Agriculture), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet de l\u2019utilisation r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e du mot \u00ab recommandation \u00bb et de son caract\u00e8re non obligatoire[4]. Le juge Cory a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au nom de la majorit\u00e9 :\nCe mot est employ\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi et, \u00e0 moins que le contexte ne s\u2019y oppose clairement, un mot doit recevoir la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation et avoir le m\u00eame sens tout au long d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif. [\u2026]\n[...] De toute \u00e9vidence, le mot \"recommandations\", au par. 52(1), a le sens ordinaire de conseils. Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a certainement pas eu l\u2019intention de donner un sens diff\u00e9rent au mot \"recommandations\" au paragraphe suivant du m\u00eame article. Le mot doit avoir le m\u00eame sens dans les deux cas.\n[15] En outre, la logique sous-tend qu\u2019ailleurs dans la loi, le mot ou l\u2019expression a un seul sens clair. Cette constatation a permis d\u2019invoquer la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019uniformit\u00e9 des expressions pour justifier l\u2019application de ce sens dans l\u2019ensemble du texte. En outre, la pr\u00e9somption s\u2019applique in\u00e9vitablement lorsque les dispositions pertinentes sont proches les unes des autres ou qu\u2019il existe un autre rapport entre elles. Cet outil a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises.\n[16] Cependant, la pr\u00e9somption peut \u00eatre \u00e9branl\u00e9e \u00ab lorsqu\u2019il ressort des circonstances que telle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb[5]. Comme l\u2019a dit le lord juge Atkin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin v. Lowry (Inspector of Taxes)[6] :\n[traduction] S\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019adopter comme principe rigide d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle, dans toute loi, les m\u00eames termes ont toujours le m\u00eame sens, notre t\u00e2che serait peut-\u00eatre plus facile; mais il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019une telle hypoth\u00e8se est non fond\u00e9e [\u2026] Il faut aussi tenir compte du contexte.\nLe sens de l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e0 un moment \u00bb au paragraphe 118(6) de la LIR\n[17] Les notes explicatives publi\u00e9es lors de l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 118(6) ne mentionnent pas l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur derri\u00e8re la formulation \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb.[7]\n[18] L\u2019historique du paragraphe 118(6) s\u2019av\u00e8re plus utile au sujet de l\u2019intention qui sous-tend l\u2019expression \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb. Avant l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 118(6) en 1988, une exemption personnelle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 109 de la LIR. Les notes techniques de 1982 relatives au paragraphe 118(6) pr\u00e9cisent :[8]\n[traduction] L\u2019article 109 accorde des exemptions personnelles qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9duites dans le calcul du revenu imposable d\u2019un particulier. La d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 109(1)(b) [maintenant 118(1)B(b)\u2013n.d.l.r.] est commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9e la d\u00e9duction pour mari\u00e9 ou l\u2019\u00e9quivalent pour les contribuables qui ne sont pas mari\u00e9s ou qui sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s ou divorc\u00e9s et qui subviennent aux besoins d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge dans leur r\u00e9sidence habituelle. La d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 109(1)f) s\u2019applique aux parents, aux grands-parents, aux fr\u00e8res et aux s\u0153urs \u00e0 charge. Les modifications apport\u00e9es aux paragraphes 109(1)b) et f) [maintenant 118(6)\u2013n.d.l.r.] exigent que, pour \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e, une personne \u00e0 charge (\u00e0 l\u2019exception du conjoint, des enfants ou des petits-enfants du contribuable) doit avoir r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada \u00e0 un certain moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[19] On peut en d\u00e9duire que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un \u00ab r\u00e9sident \u00bb, que ce soit \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, \u00ab \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb ou, du point de vue adopt\u00e9 dans les notes techniques, \u00ab \u00e0 un certain moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, a toujours exist\u00e9.\n[20] La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d\u2019une demande de d\u00e9ductions qui mettait en jeu la r\u00e9sidence dans EA Baltazar c. Canada[9]. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 divers cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t non remboursables sur une p\u00e9riode de quatre ans pour une personne \u00e0 charge vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger[10]. L\u2019appelante a fait valoir que la LIR pr\u00e9voyait une exception \u00e0 l\u2019obligation pour une personne \u00e0 charge d\u2019\u00eatre un r\u00e9sident du Canada aux fins de la demande du cr\u00e9dit \u00e9quivalent du montant pour conjoint. Le juge Sarchuk a rejet\u00e9 cet argument. Il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019analyse du juge O\u2019Connor dans l\u2019affaire Ruzicka c. Canada[11]. Pour sa part, le juge O\u2019Connor a estim\u00e9 que toute exception relative \u00e0 l\u2019obligation pour une personne \u00e0 charge d\u2019\u00eatre un r\u00e9sident du Canada en common law est, du fait de la r\u00e9sidence r\u00e9put\u00e9e, annul\u00e9e lorsque le contribuable vit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et subvient en m\u00eame temps aux besoins d\u2019une personne au pays[12]. La personne \u00e0 charge doit donc toujours \u00eatre un r\u00e9sident du Canada, au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019entend normalement la common law[13].\n[21] En guise de conclusion, pour appliquer les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Thomson, la Cour : (i) utilise le terme ou l\u2019expression tel qu\u2019il appara\u00eet ailleurs dans la LIR; (ii) analyse l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e au terme pour bien comprendre son sens dans le contexte; puis (iii) applique la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019uniformit\u00e9 des expressions. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des expressions \u00ab \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb est par ailleurs limit\u00e9e au-del\u00e0 de la jurisprudence pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[22] D\u2019un point de vue quantitatif, la LIR emploie l\u2019expression personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00ab \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb \u00e0 maintes reprises. Surtout, l\u2019expression figure dans la disposition qui impose une responsabilit\u00e9 : le paragraphe 2(1) de la LIR.\n[23] En utilisant les expressions \u00ab \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab \u00e0 un moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00bb, le Parlement modifie le terme \u00ab r\u00e9sident \u00bb, de sorte qu\u2019une personne doit \u00ab r\u00e9side[r] au Canada \u00bb pour satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res de \u00ab personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb admissible dans le cadre d\u2019une demande de d\u00e9duction pour frais m\u00e9dicaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour \u00eatre une personne qui \u00ab r\u00e9side au Canada \u00bb, il convient d\u2019utiliser les r\u00e8gles normales de r\u00e9sidence qui s\u2019appliquent par ailleurs aux autres articles de la LIR en vue d\u2019assurer une application uniforme.\n[24] Il existe deux possibilit\u00e9s pour \u00eatre un r\u00e9sident du Canada; On peut \u00eatre un r\u00e9sident r\u00e9put\u00e9[14] ou un r\u00e9sident de fait[15]. Personne ne conteste que Dennis Persaud n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un r\u00e9sident r\u00e9put\u00e9, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas s\u00e9journ\u00e9 183 jours ou plus au Canada.\n[25] Malheureusement, Dennis Persaud n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un r\u00e9sident de fait au Canada \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 en 2019. Le motif du voyage de Dennis Persaud \u00e9tait de rendre visite \u00e0 Michael Persaud et \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres de sa famille pour une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e et bien en de\u00e7\u00e0 de 180 jours. Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de sa crise cardiaque, Dennis Persaud serait retourn\u00e9 chez lui (dans son lieu de r\u00e9sidence) apr\u00e8s deux semaines. De m\u00eame, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir que Dennis Persaud avait l\u2019intention de rester au Canada. Dennis Persaud n\u2019a jamais modifi\u00e9 ni n\u2019a eu l\u2019intention de modifier l\u2019objet de son voyage, ses habitudes ou son domicile au Canada au-del\u00e0 d\u2019une courte visite, prolong\u00e9e involontairement de six semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison de sa crise cardiaque. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un r\u00e9sident de fait.\nV. Conclusion\n[26] Les mots r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s dans un article doivent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation uniforme. Selon Thomson, on doit utiliser le terme ou l\u2019expression tel qu\u2019il appara\u00eet ailleurs dans la LIR, analyser l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e au terme pour bien comprendre son sens dans le contexte, puis appliquer la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019uniformit\u00e9 des expressions, sauf indication contraire.

Il est tout \u00e0 fait impossible d\u2019en donner une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise et applicable \u00e0 tous les cas.

Dans un cas donn\u00e9, on y retrouve certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments, dans d\u2019autres, on en trouve d\u2019autres dont certains sont fr\u00e9quents et certains autres nouveaux.\nIl poursuit \u00e0 la page 816 :\nMais, dans les diff\u00e9rentes situations de pr\u00e9tendues \u00ab r\u00e9sidences permanentes \u00bb, \u00ab r\u00e9sidences temporaires \u00bb, \u00ab r\u00e9sidences ordinaires \u00bb, \u00ab r\u00e9sidences principales \u00bb et ainsi de suite, les adjectifs n\u2019influent pas sur le fait qu\u2019il y a dans tous les cas r\u00e9sidence; cette qualit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend essentiellement du point jusqu\u2019auquel une personne s\u2019\u00e9tablit en pens\u00e9e et en fait, ou conserve ou centralise son mode de vie habituel avec son cort\u00e8ge de relations sociales, d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et de convenances, au lieu en question.

Le requ\u00e9rant admet qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u la ratification par la poste probablement \u00e0 peine deux jours plus tard. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019appel dans le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, comme il en avait le droit en vertu du paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb).\n[3] Par la suite, le repr\u00e9sentant actuel du requ\u00e9rant a envoy\u00e9 un avis de demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser un appel (la \u00ab demande de prorogation \u00bb), accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un avis d\u2019appel, au greffe de la CCI \u00e0 Vancouver. Le requ\u00e9rant affirme que la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9e le 20 septembre 2023 \u00e0 20 h 24. Un requ\u00e9rant a produit un dossier de transmission par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur en la possession du repr\u00e9sentant, ce qui semble confirmer ce fait. Ce dossier comportait 13 pages et il a fallu 7 minutes 58 secondes pour le transmettre. Par cons\u00e9quent, le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la demande de prorogation, dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, \u00e9tait physiquement au bureau du greffe de la CCI, comme en t\u00e9moigne le rapport de transmission par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur du 20 juin 2023 \u00e0 20 h 32. Le lendemain matin, un membre du personnel du greffe de la cour a estampill\u00e9 la demande de prorogation telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, quand il est revenu au bureau le 21 juin 2023.\nD\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et des demandes de prorogation\n[4] Les parties ne contestent pas ces faits; toutefois, elles contestent la date de [traduction] \u00ab prise d\u2019effet \u00bb de la ratification et la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande de prorogation. Les deux le font en raison des d\u00e9lais express\u00e9ment applicables pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande de prorogation.\n[5] Le paragraphe 169(1) de la LIR pr\u00e9voit que le contribuable peut interjeter appel d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation ratifi\u00e9e, mais pr\u00e9cise que nul appel ne peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 si une p\u00e9riode de 90 jours s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9e depuis que l\u2019avis de ratification a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab envoy\u00e9 \u00bb au contribuable.\n[6] Si le contribuable ne respecte pas la p\u00e9riode de 90 jours, il y a une autre p\u00e9riode d\u2019application, un d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce d\u2019un an. Le paragraphe 167(1) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une telle demande de prorogation peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Le paragraphe 167(3) pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une demande de prorogation est \u00ab d\u00e9pos\u00e9e [\u2026] au greffe de la Cour [\u2026] de l\u2019imp\u00f4t conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00bb. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la demande de prorogation, la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t peut rendre une ordonnance de prorogation du d\u00e9lai et recevoir l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, pourvu que le requ\u00e9rant respecte certaines conditions.\n[7] Ces conditions sont \u00e0 la fois temporelles et qualitatives. Le d\u00e9lai temporel est obligatoire. Le paragraphe 167(5), et plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a), \u00e9tablit clairement qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l n\u2019est fait droit \u00e0 la demande que si [\u2026] la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration [\u2026] \u00bb pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel (voir le paragraphe 169(1) au paragraphe 5 ci-dessus).\nPourquoi les dates comptent-elles plus dans la pr\u00e9sente demande?\n[8] Passons aux dates concernant la pr\u00e9sente demande de prorogation. Si la date de prise d\u2019effet de l\u2019avis de ratification \u00e9tait le 22 juin 2022, la p\u00e9riode de 90 jours en vertu de l\u2019article 169 a expir\u00e9 le 20 septembre 2022. \u00c0 partir de cette date, le requ\u00e9rant, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 167(5)a), \u00e9tait tenu de [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9poser \u00bb sa demande de prorogation dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant le 20 septembre 2022 : le 20 septembre 2023. Comme je l\u2019indique ci-dessus, le greffe de la CCI a constat\u00e9 le [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00bb de la demande de prorogation, selon son cachet, le 21 septembre 2023. Il s\u2019agissait du lendemain du 20 septembre 2023, date limite d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par le ministre. Si ces dates sont exactes, la demande de prorogation est hors d\u00e9lai, d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019audition de cette demande.\nPosition juridique des parties\nRequ\u00e9rant\n[9] Le repr\u00e9sentant du requ\u00e9rant soutient que la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 temps pour deux raisons, chacune \u00e0 titre subsidiaire.\nDate de r\u00e9ception par la CCI de la demande de prorogation\n[10] Tout d\u2019abord, le repr\u00e9sentant soutient que la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur, dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, le 20 septembre 2023. Les R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) pr\u00e9voient le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 4.2a) pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n4.2 Sauf disposition contraire des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou directive contraire de la Cour, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un document au greffe est r\u00e9put\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 :\na) dans le cas d\u2019un document remis au greffe, exp\u00e9di\u00e9 par la poste ou transmis par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur, \u00e0 la date estampill\u00e9e sur le document par le greffe \u00e0 sa r\u00e9ception;\n[11] La demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 physiquement re\u00e7ue par le greffe de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t le 20 septembre 2023. Il s\u2019agit simplement de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 : une copie t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9e de la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur au greffe de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 cette date.\nDate d\u2019envoi de la ratification\n[12] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le requ\u00e9rant affirme qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de ratification au plus t\u00f4t le 24 juin 2022. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par courrier express. Les faits ne permettent pas de d\u00e9terminer avec certitude \u00e0 quel moment exactement la ratification a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e physiquement. On sait que la ratification est dat\u00e9e du 22 juin 2022. Sa date ultime de r\u00e9ception par le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e, seulement sa date r\u00e9elle d\u2019\u00ab envoi \u00bb r\u00e9put\u00e9e.\n[13] Le requ\u00e9rant fait valoir que, logiquement, si la date r\u00e9put\u00e9e d\u2019envoi est m\u00eame le 23 juin 2022, la p\u00e9riode de 90 jours suivants prendrait alors fin le 21 septembre 2023 (article 169) et la derni\u00e8re date applicable un an plus tard serait le 21 septembre 2022 (paragraphe 167(5)). Le greffe de la CCI, m\u00eame selon ses propres indications, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la demande de prorogation le 21 septembre 2023.\nIntim\u00e9\n[14] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et les R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sont claires : la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 21 septembre 2023 et est hors d\u00e9lai. La Cour n\u2019a pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accepter une demande de prorogation hors d\u00e9lai. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 l\u2019argument du requ\u00e9rant concernant l\u2019incertitude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019avis de ratification a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9.\nQuestions en litige\n[15] La Cour doit d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quelle date en droit :\na)la demande de prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du greffe de la CCI (la \u00ab date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande \u00bb);\nb)l\u2019avis de ratification a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par le ministre et est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par le requ\u00e9rant (la \u00ab date d\u2019envoi de la ratification \u00bb), respectivement?\na)Analyse et d\u00e9cision : Date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande\nL\u00e9gislation\n[16] Les R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure informelle) applicables (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) pr\u00e9voient aux articles 4.1 et 4.2 ce qui suit :\nD\u00e9p\u00f4t des autres documents\n4.1 Sauf disposition contraire des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou directive contraire de la Cour, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un document autre qu\u2019un avis d\u2019appel peut s\u2019effectuer de l\u2019une des mani\u00e8res ci-apr\u00e8s :\na) remise au greffe;\nb) exp\u00e9dition au greffe par la poste;\nc) transmission au greffe par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur ou par d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9lectronique.\nDate de d\u00e9p\u00f4t\n4.2 Sauf disposition contraire des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou directive contraire de la Cour, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un document au greffe est r\u00e9put\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 :\na) dans le cas d\u2019un document remis au greffe, exp\u00e9di\u00e9 par la poste ou transmis par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur, \u00e0 la date estampill\u00e9e sur le document par le greffe \u00e0 sa r\u00e9ception;\nb) dans le cas d\u2019un document faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9lectronique, \u00e0 celle apparaissant sur l\u2019accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception transmis par la Cour.\nInterpr\u00e9tation\n[17] Bien qu\u2019aucune jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure n\u2019ait examin\u00e9 express\u00e9ment de l\u2019article 4.1 ou 4.2 des R\u00e8gles ci-dessus, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un libell\u00e9 similaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e.\n[18] L\u2019affaire Covic c. MRN[1] portait sur une question semblable o\u00f9 une demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 estampill\u00e9e par le greffe trois jours apr\u00e8s la date limite. Dans cette affaire, la juge Woods a estim\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Ce faisant, la juge Woods a appliqu\u00e9 le paragraphe 5(2) et l\u2019article 5.2 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Il s\u2019agit des variantes de l\u2019article 4.2 ci-dessus, mais applicables au R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[19] La Cour note une distinction curieuse. L\u2019article 4.1 des R\u00e8gles regroupe le d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9lectronique et la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie dans le m\u00eame alin\u00e9a pour la signification de documents. Toutefois, en vertu de l\u2019article 4.2 des R\u00e8gles, ces modes de signification sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s, la signification par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur \u00e9tant assign\u00e9e \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle le bureau du greffe appose l\u2019estampille sur la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie. En revanche, les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par voie \u00e9lectronique sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la date indiqu\u00e9e sur l\u2019accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception transmis par la Cour.\n[20] La Cour peut expliquer la distinction. Premi\u00e8rement, il y a un fondement logique pour traiter diff\u00e9remment la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie de documents et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9lectronique de documents en ce qui concerne la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t r\u00e9put\u00e9e. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4.2a) des R\u00e8gles, les documents t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9s sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle ils sont estampill\u00e9s par le bureau du greffe. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une conclusion logique puisqu\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9copie est en format papier et ne peut \u00eatre automatiquement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans un syst\u00e8me d\u2019enregistrement de documents. En revanche, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t instantan\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me d\u2019enregistrement d\u2019un document en format num\u00e9rique peut se produire pour un document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par voie \u00e9lectronique. Le repr\u00e9sentant du requ\u00e9rant a choisi de transmettre la demande par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur apr\u00e8s les heures d\u2019ouverture, de sorte que le bureau du greffe n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019estampiller la demande le 20 septembre 2023, en l\u2019absence de l\u2019acte physique de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur. Ce geste s\u2019apparente \u00e0 celui d\u2019ouvrir une enveloppe et d\u2019estampiller la ratification, lorsqu\u2019elle est envoy\u00e9e par la poste.\n[21] Les R\u00e8gles indiquent clairement que la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e que sous deux formes de preuve selon le mode de transmission : (i) l\u2019estampille du bureau du greffe pour le courrier ou les t\u00e9l\u00e9copies ou (ii) le re\u00e7u d\u2019accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception transmis par la Cour pour les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par voie \u00e9lectronique. Ni le requ\u00e9rant ni son repr\u00e9sentant n\u2019ont re\u00e7u de la Cour l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces formes de preuve avec une date qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande de prorogation. Le fait que la demande de prorogation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur et non par voie \u00e9lectronique est d\u2019une importance cruciale.\n[22] Enfin, les mots \u00ab [s]auf [\u2026] directive contraire de la Cour \u00bb figurant dans le pr\u00e9ambule des articles 4.1 et 4.2 des R\u00e8gles semblent \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Cour de vastes pouvoirs lui permettant de d\u00e9roger aux dispositions d\u00e9terminatives qui suivent dans les articles, si la Cour le juge \u00e0 propos. Le repr\u00e9sentant du requ\u00e9rant soutient que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a t\u00e9l\u00e9copi\u00e9 la demande de prorogation \u00e0 la Cour \u00e0 une date [traduction] \u00ab dans les d\u00e9lais \u00bb. Cela est insuffisant pour deux raisons : (i) les R\u00e8gles sont claires en ce sens qu\u2019elles concernent la r\u00e9ception des t\u00e9l\u00e9copies; et la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre la date estampill\u00e9e par le bureau de greffe.\n[23] De plus, l\u2019exception pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [s]auf disposition contraire des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou directive contraire de la Cour, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t [\u2026] est r\u00e9put\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 \u00bb. Ce libell\u00e9 est clairement conjonctif. Les R\u00e8gles doivent pr\u00e9voir une \u00ab disposition contraire \u00bb afin que la Cour puisse exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et ordonner autre chose. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9voient pas une \u00ab disposition contraire \u00bb et, par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour ne peut rendre de \u00ab directive contraire \u00bb.\n[24] Pour ce motif, la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande de prorogation \u00e9tait, comme l\u2019indique le greffe de la CCI, le 21 septembre 2023.\na)Analyse et d\u00e9cision : Date d\u2019envoi de la ratification\nL\u00e9gislation\n[25] La LIR est applicable quant \u00e0 la date d\u2019envoi de la ratification parce que ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 en vertu de cette Loi.

Cela signifie habituellement l\u2019envoi par la poste de tels avis. Le ministre n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019effectuer la signification \u00e0 personne ni m\u00eame de veiller \u00e0 ce que la notification soit \u00ab re\u00e7ue \u00bb par le contribuable; l\u2019envoi d\u2019un avis par la poste suffit pour que le ministre s\u2019acquitte de ses obligations[2].\n[27] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 248(7)a) de la Loi est une disposition d\u00e9terminative selon laquelle un contribuable est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u un avis du ministre le jour de sa mise \u00e0 la poste, pourvu qu\u2019il l\u2019ait re\u00e7u par envoi de premi\u00e8re classe[3]. La pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 248(7)a) n\u2019est pas une pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9futable[4]. Selon le paragraphe 244(14) de la Loi, la date de mise \u00e0 la poste est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00eatre la m\u00eame que celle qui figure sur l\u2019avis. L\u2019arr\u00eat Schafer soutient \u00e9galement la proposition selon laquelle, lorsqu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9, le d\u00e9compte commence peu importe le moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par un contribuable, ou m\u00eame si c\u2019est le cas[5].\n[28] Dans la d\u00e9cision 741290 Ontario, le juge Rossiter (plus tard juge en chef) a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u2019intersection du paragraphe 244(14) et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 248(7)a) de la Loi en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019un avis donn\u00e9 par un contribuable :\n[14] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019envoi par la poste, plusieurs dispositions l\u00e9gislatives rendent la charge de la preuve plus facile pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir.\n[15] Le paragraphe 244(14) de la LIR pr\u00e9voit que, lorsqu\u2019un avis de cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par la poste, il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la poste \u00e0 la date inscrite sur l\u2019avis de cotisation [\u2026]\n[16] De plus, si l\u2019avis de cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par courrier de premi\u00e8re classe, l\u2019avis est r\u00e9put\u00e9, en vertu du paragraphe 248(7) de la LIR, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par le contribuable le jour de sa mise \u00e0 la poste [\u2026]\n[17] La pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle quelque chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u \u00e0 la date de sa mise \u00e0 la poste n\u2019est pas r\u00e9futable[6].\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[29] Dans la d\u00e9cision Laing, notre Cour a formul\u00e9 les commentaires suivants au sujet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 248(7)a) et d\u2019un contribuable qui soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir \u00e0 quel moment un avis a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u :\n[\u2026] la seule chance qu\u2019aurait eue le demandeur d\u2019avoir gain de cause aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019avis de nouvelle cotisation n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 ou post\u00e9 par l\u2019ARC le 14 novembre 2014.

Cet arrangement a \u00e9t\u00e9 ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 dans leur jugement de divorce, en 2013. Le p\u00e8re a par la suite all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00eatre un parent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e, et l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en 2019 que les parents \u00e9taient des parents ayant la garde partag\u00e9e pour les ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2015 \u00e0 2017. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 un paiement en trop qui fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un recouvrement aupr\u00e8s de la m\u00e8re. Celle-ci interjette aujourd\u2019hui appel de cette d\u00e9termination.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus, en me fondant sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour, que le p\u00e8re n\u2019est pas un parent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e et que la m\u00e8re a droit au plein montant de l\u2019ACE.\nI.

La question juridique qui se pose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est donc de savoir si les enfants ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au moins 40 % du temps avec leur p\u00e8re et si, durant ce temps, le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait principalement responsable de leur soin et de leur \u00e9ducation de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 6302 du R\u00e8glement.\n[7] Il n\u2019existe aucune m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9cise pour r\u00e9partir le temps que les enfants passent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tablir le pourcentage de temps de garde minimal de 40 % ou de d\u00e9terminer quel parent est principalement responsable du soin et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants pendant leurs journ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Ni la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ni la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t n\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9cise de calcul applicable aux journ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Le calcul d\u00e9pend des circonstances et des faits particuliers.\nII. Les faits 1. Les enfants r\u00e9sidaient-ils avec leur p\u00e8re au moins 40 % du temps? [8] Les deux parents ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Les enfants ont pass\u00e9 une fin de semaine sur deux avec leur p\u00e8re et habitaient avec lui deux nuit\u00e9es par semaine, les jours de semaine. Leur m\u00e8re a clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun changement n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9 \u00e0 ces p\u00e9riodes auxquelles le p\u00e8re a acc\u00e8s aux enfants, depuis leur s\u00e9paration jusqu\u2019en 2018. En 2018, le p\u00e8re a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande aupr\u00e8s de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec en vue de faire modifier le jugement de divorce de 2013, et il a modifi\u00e9 cette demande en 2019. Aucune modification n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 ce jour. Dans sa demande, le p\u00e8re a confirm\u00e9 cet arrangement et le fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en vigueur depuis le d\u00e9but et qu\u2019il s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019en juillet 2018.\n[9] Selon la m\u00e8re, toutes les deux fins de semaine, les enfants \u00e9taient avec leur p\u00e8re de 9 h le samedi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il les d\u00e9pose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ou \u00e0 son domicile le lundi matin avant 9 h. Le p\u00e8re a indiqu\u00e9 que, selon ses souvenirs, les enfants avaient pass\u00e9 un jour par fin de semaine avec lui et non une fin de semaine compl\u00e8te sur deux. Cependant, son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair et coh\u00e9rent, et il \u00e9tait incapable de se rappeler plusieurs choses. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le manque de fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage du p\u00e8re, lorsqu\u2019il y a divergence entre les deux t\u00e9moignages, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de la m\u00e8re (\u00e0 moins qu\u2019il aille \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve cr\u00e9dibles en faveur du p\u00e8re). Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le texto que le p\u00e8re a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00e8re le 26 ao\u00fbt 2018 a express\u00e9ment confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019arrangement pr\u00e9voyait une fin de semaine sur deux, de 9 h le samedi \u00e0 9 h le lundi. Dans ce m\u00eame texto, le p\u00e8re a confirm\u00e9 que les deux nuit\u00e9es en semaine commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 17 h 15 en soir\u00e9e pour prendre fin \u00e0 9 h le matin suivant. Cela cadre \u00e9galement avec l\u2019invitation et les entr\u00e9es dans son calendrier Outlook quotidien de 2018 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites en preuve, lesquelles montrent que les nuit\u00e9es en semaine pendant lesquelles il avait les enfants commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 17 h la veille pour prendre fin \u00e0 8 h 30 le jour suivant. D\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayaient \u00e9galement ce fait.\n[10] L\u2019appelante a clairement mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019\u2019acc\u00e8s du p\u00e8re aux enfants sont demeur\u00e9es les m\u00eames pendant les vacances estivales des enfants. En d\u2019autres termes, les enfants ont continu\u00e9 de retourner chez leur m\u00e8re \u00e0 9 h le lundi matin toutes les deux fins de semaine, et \u00e0 9 h le matin suivant les deux nuit\u00e9es en semaine pendant lesquelles ils \u00e9taient avec leur p\u00e8re.\n[11] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le calendrier des parents, toutes les deux semaines, l\u2019une des nuit\u00e9es en semaine commen\u00e7ait le lundi entre 17 h et 17 h 30 et prenait fin le mardi matin. Lorsque l\u2019acc\u00e8s du lundi en soir\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au lendemain a commenc\u00e9, le p\u00e8re n\u2019allait pas chercher les enfants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire. Les enfants allaient d\u2019abord chez leur m\u00e8re apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9cole.\n[12] La fiabilit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question parce qu\u2019il a maintes fois \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se souvenir des faits, notamment si les enfants avaient pass\u00e9 une fin de semaine sur deux avec lui chaque ann\u00e9e ou s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pass\u00e9 qu\u2019un seul jour par fin de semaine avec lui; s\u2019il avait \u00e9crit la lettre \u00e0 sa cousine dans laquelle il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 le nombre apparemment erron\u00e9 de jours par semaine qu\u2019elle l\u2019aurait eu vu avec les enfants; s\u2019il \u00e9tait ou non l\u2019auteur de la lettre de son employeur qui mentionnait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de travailler deux jours par semaine, sans toutefois pr\u00e9ciser s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible en soir\u00e9e seulement ou pour la journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. D\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de se rappeler s\u2019il avait travaill\u00e9 ces jours-l\u00e0, et a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 se souvenir du moment de la journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 il ramassait et d\u00e9posait les enfants les jours de semaine, pendant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[13] Le p\u00e8re a fait une d\u00e9claration inexacte \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada par le biais de sa demande visant \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnu en tant que parent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il lui a indiqu\u00e9 que ses enfants habitaient avec lui trois jours complets sur sept par semaine. Cela soul\u00e8ve des doutes quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il dit \u00e0 la Cour.\n[14] Je ne vois aucune raison de consid\u00e9rer le temps que les enfants passent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole tous les deux lundis pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire en tant que temps que les enfants ont pass\u00e9 avec leur p\u00e8re. Son droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s a pris fin \u00e0 9 h. Sa nuit\u00e9e du lundi n\u2019a pas commenc\u00e9 avant 17 h ou m\u00eame plus tard, au retour des enfants qui se rendaient chez leur m\u00e8re pour un certain temps. Pendant les vacances estivales, les enfants ne passaient pas de temps avec leur p\u00e8re, durant la journ\u00e9e, le lundi. Je ne vois \u00e9galement aucune raison de consid\u00e9rer les nuit\u00e9es en semaine que les enfants ont pass\u00e9es avec leur p\u00e8re comme des journ\u00e9es de 24 heures.\n[15] Je juge que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve ne suffit pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les enfants ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au moins 40 % du temps avec leur p\u00e8re.\n2. Soin et \u00e9ducation [16] Le p\u00e8re a pris soin de ses enfants lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient avec lui. Au cours des nuit\u00e9es en semaine, il soupait avec eux et pr\u00e9parait leur repas du midi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole pour le lendemain. Il s\u2019assurait qu\u2019ils avaient fait leurs devoirs en soir\u00e9e. Le p\u00e8re assistait \u00e0 quelques-unes des activit\u00e9s des enfants, et il se rappelle avoir accompagn\u00e9 la m\u00e8re \u00e0 quelques rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux.\n[17] La m\u00e8re coordonnait l\u2019ensemble des activit\u00e9s des enfants ainsi que leurs rendez-vous avec le m\u00e9decin de famille, l\u2019optom\u00e9triste et le dentiste. Elle \u00e9tait le parent principal avec qui l\u2019\u00e9cole communiquait concernant les enfants. Lorsque l\u2019un des enfants devait quitter l\u2019\u00e9cole t\u00f4t en raison de probl\u00e8mes de comportement, l\u2019\u00e9cole communiquait principalement avec la m\u00e8re, qui allait alors chercher l\u2019enfant ou demandait \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re de le faire. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9cole, les enfants retournaient chez leur m\u00e8re, o\u00f9 leur p\u00e8re les ramassait entre 17 h et 17 h 30 pour sa nuit\u00e9e, et ce, m\u00eame les lundis. Lorsque les enfants \u00e9taient \u00e0 la maison apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9cole, la m\u00e8re leur offrait des collations et s\u2019assurait qu\u2019ils faisaient leurs devoirs avant qu\u2019ils partent chez leur p\u00e8re.\n[18] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces faits, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait av\u00e9r\u00e9 que tous les deuxi\u00e8mes lundis, pendant l\u2019\u00e9cole, comptent pour le temps pass\u00e9 avec le p\u00e8re, et que l\u2019\u00e9cole a pu \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 joindre l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des parents pour lui faire part de pr\u00e9occupations au sujet des enfants, je conclus que la m\u00e8re \u00e9tait principalement responsable du soin et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants pendant chacun des jours d\u2019\u00e9cole.\n[19] Pour ces motifs, l\u2019appel est accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 18e jour d\u2019avril 2024.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nLe juge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 46\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2019-3661(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nPATRICIA L\u00c9VESQUE ST-CYR c.

L\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 ultimement rejet\u00e9 par le juge du fond le 16 octobre 2018 (Jugement) sur pr\u00e9sentation, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel le 15 octobre 2018, d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour cause de retard en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t (Proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale), DORS\/90-688, telles que modifi\u00e9es (R\u00e8gles).\n[2] L\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles se lit comme suit :\n64 L\u2019intim\u00e9e qui n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9faut en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ou d\u2019un jugement de la Cour peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate, le rejet de l\u2019appel pour cause de retard si l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas poursuivi l\u2019appel avec promptitude.\n[3] Ainsi, les motifs au soutien du rejet de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es sont en lien avec les circonstances et les d\u00e9lais avec lesquels la requ\u00e9rante a men\u00e9 son appel devant la Cour. Les motifs de la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de son appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en avril 2011 ne sont pas au c\u0153ur du Jugement rendu dont la requ\u00e9rante cherche l\u2019annulation.\n[4] Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de l\u2019audition tenue le 15 octobre 2018 fait \u00e9tat du d\u00e9bat qu\u2019a entrain\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour rejet d\u2019appel pour cause de retard. Et suite \u00e0 ce d\u00e9bat, le Jugement fut rendu en accordant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et rejetant l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante visant les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. Le Jugement n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel par aucune des parties au Jugement.\n[5] L\u2019historique du pr\u00e9sent dossier de la Cour indique que pendant une dur\u00e9e de plus de sept ans, 4 avocats se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 pour repr\u00e9senter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la requ\u00e9rante, les \u00e9ch\u00e9anciers amend\u00e9s, la liste de documents de la requ\u00e9rante d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 3 mars 2016, des audiences de justification tenues, un juge gestionnaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9, une date d\u2019audition d\u00e9termin\u00e9e le 14 novembre 2017 pour audition les 15, 16 et 17 octobre 2018. Et ultimement, le premier jour de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel une requ\u00eate pour cessation d\u2019occuper de l\u2019avocat de la requ\u00e9rante est trait\u00e9e et aucun procureur pour repr\u00e9senter les appelantes (dont la requ\u00e9rante), seul un repr\u00e9sentant agissant pour le compte des fiducies au dossier (dont la requ\u00e9rante) pr\u00e9sent pour l\u2019unique fin de d\u00e9poser un document qui demande l\u2019ajournement de tous les dossiers des appelantes (incluant la requ\u00e9rante) devant la Cour.\n[6] La requ\u00e9rante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 5 juillet 2023 une requ\u00eate en vertu de l\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles (Requ\u00eate) afin d\u2019annuler le Jugement rejetant l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, et r\u00e9f\u00e8re plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) des R\u00e8gles. La requ\u00e9rante demande que la Requ\u00eate soit tranch\u00e9e sur la base des observations \u00e9crites et sans comparution des parties conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 69 des R\u00e8gles.\n[7] La Requ\u00eate indique notamment que :\nLa requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 obtenir la r\u00e9ouverture du dossier 2011-1193(IT)G \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9ception du dossier : Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019Information. Je suis en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas analys\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des informations Les procureurs de la Cour Canadienne d\u2019Imp\u00f4t (sic) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 induits en erreur \u00e0 la suite de documents non-divulgu\u00e9 par des repr\u00e9sentants(es)de l\u2019ARC et de la Division des enqu\u00eates.\nLes documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s d\u00e9montrent clairement un impact n\u00e9gatif majeur sur les jugements rendus. Les procureurs qui le repr\u00e9sentaient ont \u00e9t\u00e9, par ce fait, induits en erreur.\nSelon la r\u00e8gle 172(2)a, le requ\u00e9rant demande l\u2019annulation pour les modifications d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu.\n[8] L\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit :\n172 (1) Le jugement qui :\na) comporte une erreur d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un lapsus ou d\u2019une omission;\nb) doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 une question sur laquelle la Cour n\u2019a pas statu\u00e9, peut \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 par la Cour, sur demande ou de son propre chef.\n(2) Une partie peut demander, par voie de requ\u00eate dans l\u2019instance, selon le cas :\na) l\u2019annulation ou la modification d\u2019un jugement en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu;\nb) un sursis d\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement;\nc) une mesure de redressement diff\u00e9rente de celle qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[9] La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9cise que les moyens au soutien de la Requ\u00eate sont les suivants :\nPar suite de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, le requ\u00e9rant est en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ARC et la Division des enqu\u00eates avaient la preuve depuis 2006 que Fiducie Mario Laquerre n\u2019avait pas omis de d\u00e9clarer un montant de 261 734,69$ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2001.\nFiducie Mario Laquerre avait contract\u00e9 un pr\u00eat \u00e0 Fiducie ML et ce dit pr\u00eat, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de moins de 12 mois \u00e0 Fiducie ML. Le requ\u00e9rant a re\u00e7u un tableau des enqu\u00eates d\u00e9montrant un encaissement des ch\u00e8ques totalisant 167 000$ du compte de Fiducie ML Banque de Montr\u00e9al. Cet encaissement provenait de Fiducie Mario Laquerre au compte 3391 pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er novembre au 24 d\u00e9cembre 2001.\nLe requ\u00e9rant a re\u00e7u le dossier jaune de Jeannot Roy d\u00e9montrant un remboursement additionnel de 250K de Fiducie Mario Laquerre \u00e0 Fiducie ML de janvier 2002 \u00e0 novembre 2002.\n[10] Il y a lieu de pr\u00e9ciser que la Cour ne peut \u00eatre saisie que de la Requ\u00eate visant l\u2019annulation du Jugement rendu. Et dans ce contexte, le r\u00f4le de la Cour n\u2019est pas de statuer sur le fond ou le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es.\n[11] La Cour constate \u00e9galement que les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante sont uniquement en lien avec l\u2019objet ou le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es. Aucun des moyens invoqu\u00e9s ne vise le fait que le Jugement suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement, tel que le requiert l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) des R\u00e8gles.\n[12] L\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles d\u00e9cide uniquement d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour rejet de l\u2019appel en lien avec le d\u00e9faut de promptitude dont a pu faire preuve l\u2019appelant \u00e0 poursuivre son appel. La situation ainsi examin\u00e9e est post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019appel par l\u2019appelant devant la Cour. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, cette p\u00e9riode est post\u00e9rieure au 18 avril 2011 et ne vise que les agissements de la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 faire preuve de promptitude dans la poursuite de son appel devant la Cour.\n[13] Le Jugement repr\u00e9sente la d\u00e9cision de la Cour quant \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la promptitude dont a fait preuve la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 poursuivre son appel. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue sur le bien-fond\u00e9 ou le fond de l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante. Un d\u00e9saccord de la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aurait justifi\u00e9 un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 27 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[14] Alternativement, une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 172 des R\u00e8gles, notamment l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) comme l\u2019a fait la requ\u00e9rante. Cependant, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Doussot c. Canada, 2022 CAF 199 souligne que pour r\u00e9ussir sous l\u2019alin\u00e9a 172(2)a) :\nun requ\u00e9rant doit prouver que l\u2019annulation ou la modification du jugement en cause est justifi\u00e9e en raison d\u2019une fraude ou de faits survenus ou d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s que ledit jugement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. Cela requiert une preuve, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate en bonne et due forme adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCI.\n[15] Les trois moyens soulev\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante visent le fond de l\u2019appel \u00e0 savoir selon la requ\u00e9rante que l\u2019appel serait bien fond\u00e9. Tel que repris au paragraphe 8 plus haut, les moyens invoquent le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019omission de d\u00e9clarer un montant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2001, qu\u2019un pr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de moins de 12 mois, et qu\u2019un remboursement additionnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 de janvier 2002 \u00e0 novembre 2002. Aucun de ces moyens n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli comme ayant un lien avec la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles.\n[16] La Cour n\u2019est pas persuad\u00e9e, selon la balance de probabilit\u00e9s, que les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de la Requ\u00eate \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019il y a eu fraude de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec le Jugement rendu ou que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et qui s\u2019av\u00e9raient importants aux fins du Jugement rendu en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles ou encore auraient probablement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un jugement diff\u00e9rent toujours sous l\u2019article 64 s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s initialement.\n[17] La requ\u00e9rante ne pr\u00e9cise pas la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a re\u00e7u les documents suite \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Elle r\u00e9f\u00e8re la Cour \u00e0 un document \u00e9manant du Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019information du Canada en date du 30 mai 2022.\n[18] Les pi\u00e8ces au soutien de la Requ\u00eate contiennent essentiellement une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux (i) documents li\u00e9s au dossier de la Cour concernant l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (ii) documents judiciaires impliquant nomm\u00e9ment la requ\u00e9rante, monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement ou l\u2019une ou des parties li\u00e9es regroup\u00e9es avec la requ\u00e9rante aux fins de la tenue de l\u2019audition (collectivement Personnes nomm\u00e9es), (iii) documents et bordereaux bancaires des Personnes nomm\u00e9es en lien avec les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (iv) document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec la v\u00e9rification et les documents bancaires des Personnes nomm\u00e9es aux Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (v) document judiciaire provenant d\u2019un dossier judiciaire impliquant monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement et des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 des op\u00e9rations bancaires en 2001, (vi) communication interne de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec la section du recouvrement, et (vii) courriel auquel est partie monsieur Mario Laquerre.\n[19] La r\u00e9plique de la requ\u00e9rante aux observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la Requ\u00eate et d\u2019autres documents dont (i) des analyses bancaires en lien avec les Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, (ii) pi\u00e8ces sur lesquels la requ\u00e9rante tire des conclusions l\u00e9gales concernant la v\u00e9rification fiscale de la requ\u00e9rante, et (iii) document judiciaire dat\u00e9 de 2006 impliquant monsieur Mario Laquerre personnellement.\n[20] Malheureusement, l\u2019examen de toutes ces pi\u00e8ces n\u2019am\u00e8ne pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments substantiels ou suffisamment pertinents au soutien de la fa\u00e7on dont la requ\u00e9rante a pu poursuivre avec promptitude ou diligence l\u2019appel des Ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es devant la Cour. Cet examen n\u2019est pas davantage concluant pour la Cour aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu fraude dans le cadre de l\u2019audition ayant men\u00e9 au Jugement, ni que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et pr\u00e9sentent une importance telle qu\u2019ils entachent la validit\u00e9 du Jugement.\n[21] En fait, la Cour est d\u2019avis que les moyens de la requ\u00e9rante accompagn\u00e9s des pi\u00e8ces sont essentiellement des motifs que la requ\u00e9rante aurait pu vouloir d\u00e9battre au fond. Ce d\u00e9bat n\u2019a pu eu lieu consid\u00e9rant le Jugement et le r\u00f4le de la Cour n\u2019est pas d\u2019ouvrir ce d\u00e9bat en tranchant la Requ\u00eate.\n[22] Consid\u00e9rant ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour est d\u2019avis que la preuve de la requ\u00e9rante au soutien de la Requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, fraude de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada en lien avec le Jugement rendu ou que des faits sont survenus ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts apr\u00e8s la date du Jugement et qui s\u2019av\u00e9raient importants aux fins du Jugement rendu en vertu de l\u2019article 64 des R\u00e8gles, ou auraient pu donner lieu \u00e0 un jugement diff\u00e9rent, toujours sous l\u2019article 64, s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s initialement.\n[23] La Requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens de 1 000 $ payables par la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans les 30 jours suivants la date des pr\u00e9sentes.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 19e jour de janvier 2024.\n\u00ab J.M.

Othniel Defreitas, a demand\u00e9 le remboursement de la TPS\/TVH pour habitations neuves s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 un bien situ\u00e9 au 3, avenue Matthewson, Bradford (Ontario) L3Z 0P3. Le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) a refus\u00e9 le remboursement. M. Defreitas a interjet\u00e9 appel du refus devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Dans son avis de r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire afin de faire annuler l\u2019appel au motif que les conditions pr\u00e9alables pour d\u00e9poser l\u2019appel n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que M. Defreitas ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la cotisation dans le d\u00e9lai imparti pour le faire, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour s\u2019opposer dans le d\u00e9lai imparti pour le faire et qu\u2019il est maintenant hors d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une telle demande. Comme l\u2019opposition \u00e0 une cotisation est une condition pr\u00e9alable pour interjeter appel d\u2019une cotisation devant notre Cour, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\nI. QUESTION EN LITIGE [2] \u00c0 ce stade, la seule question en litige sur laquelle notre Cour doit statuer est celle de savoir \u00e0 quelle date l\u2019avis de cotisation (l\u2019\u00ab AC \u00bb) a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Defreitas. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que l\u2019AC en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par la poste le 1er avril 2015. M. Defreitas all\u00e8gue ne pas avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019AC de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) avant le 18 mai 2021, date \u00e0 laquelle un agent des recouvrements de l\u2019ARC lui a remis une copie. L\u2019intim\u00e9 admet que si l\u2019AC a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la date all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, M. Defreitas a fait opposition dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, L.R.C. 1985, ch. E-15 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) et l\u2019appel ne devrait pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9. Ainsi, l\u2019unique question en ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire concerne la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9.\nII. EXPOS\u00c9 DES FAITS [3] Le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, l\u2019appelant a achet\u00e9 un bien situ\u00e9 au 3, avenue Matthewson, Bradford (Ontario). Le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 le 1er avril 2014.\n[4] Le 28 mars 2014, l\u2019appelant a sign\u00e9 la demande de remboursement de la TPS\/TVH pour les maisons achet\u00e9es d\u2019un constructeur. Cette demande comprenait son adresse au 3, avenue Matthewson.\n[5] En f\u00e9vrier 2015, l\u2019ARC a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 l\u2019appelant.\n[6] Le 14 juin 2016, l\u2019appelant la r\u00e9sidence situ\u00e9e au 3, avenue Matthewson.\n[7] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2020, l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u une lettre de mise en garde juridique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une dette de TPS\/TVH.\n[8] Le 4 ao\u00fbt 2021, l\u2019appelant a, par voie \u00e9lectronique, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du ministre un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation.\n[9] Le ministre a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 4 ao\u00fbt 2021 comme une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition.\n[10] Le 15 octobre 2021, le ministre a refus\u00e9 la demande par l\u2019appelant de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour produire un avis d\u2019opposition, parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e 2 227 jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai pour accueillir ce type de demande de prorogation pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 303(7)a) de la Loi.\n[11] Le 9 novembre 2021, l\u2019appelant a interjet\u00e9 appel devant notre Cour relativement \u00e0 la cotisation.\n[12] Dans le courant de d\u00e9cembre 2020, l\u2019appelant a engag\u00e9 Alexander Shaulov pour que ce dernier le repr\u00e9sente. M. Shaulov a fait des demandes aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ARC, dont une demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels (AIPRP).\n[13] M. Shaulov a conclu que l\u2019AC applicable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019ARC le 1er avril 2015. Cette conclusion est en grande partie fond\u00e9e sur son analyse des renseignements fournis \u00e0 la suite de sa demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP.\n[14] L\u2019appelant et M. Shaulov ont tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en son nom. M. Anujan Kumaranathan, un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Un affidavit de Wade Smith, un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ARC, a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[15] Je ne remets en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019aucun t\u00e9moin qui a fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Chaque partie s\u2019est efforc\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre utile et de r\u00e9pondre aux questions pos\u00e9es. Cependant, comme cela sera examin\u00e9 plus loin, plusieurs t\u00e9moins me demandent de tirer une conclusion de fait qui est diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019appelant ont indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 avant 2021, tandis que les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 attestent que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015.\nIII. LA TH\u00c8SE DE L\u2019APPELANT [16] La plupart des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019appelante provenaient de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Shaulov. Voici les raisons pour lesquelles l\u2019appelant affirme que je devrais conclure que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015 :\n(i) d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen par M. Shaulov des renseignements fournis \u00e0 la suite de la demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP, l\u2019ARC s\u2019est content\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un projet d\u2019AC en avril 2015; (ii) avant 2021, l\u2019ARC n\u2019avait ni le num\u00e9ro d\u2019assurance sociale ni l\u2019adresse de M. Defreitas. En fait, il soutient que l\u2019ARC ne disposait pas de suffisamment de pi\u00e8ces pour \u00e9tablir une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelant en 2015; (iii) l\u2019appelant demande \u00e0 la Cour de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9sultats de sa demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP. Il en est ainsi parce qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de sa demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP, on ne lui a fourni qu\u2019un projet d\u2019AC. Il invoque le paragraphe 30(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada L.R.C. 1985, ch. C-5 pour avancer cet argument. Ce paragraphe est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nPr\u00e9somption \u00e0 tirer du d\u00e9faut de renseignements\n(2) Lorsqu\u2019une pi\u00e8ce \u00e9tablie dans le cours ordinaire des affaires ne contient pas de renseignements sur une chose dont on peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 trouver la survenance ou l\u2019existence consign\u00e9es dans cette pi\u00e8ce, le tribunal peut, sur production de la pi\u00e8ce, admettre celle-ci aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir ce d\u00e9faut de renseignements et peut en conclure qu\u2019une telle chose ne s\u2019est pas produite ou n\u2019a pas exist\u00e9.\nIV. LA TH\u00c8SE DE L\u2019INTIM\u00c9 [17] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019une cotisation est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la date de son envoi, et qu\u2019elle est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le destinataire \u00e0 cette date[1].\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que l\u2019appelant ne doit pas se contenter d\u2019affirmer ne pas avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019AC en avril 2015. Il doit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve cr\u00e9dibles pour \u00e9tayer cette th\u00e8se.\n[19] Dans son analyse de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque ce qui suit. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas produit de d\u00e9claration de revenus depuis 2003. Il indique que les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de l\u2019appelant [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9v\u00e8lent du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses obligations fiscales aux termes de diff\u00e9rentes lois fiscales \u00bb[2]. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019absence d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition d\u00fbment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ne permet pas de d\u00e9duire que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u l\u2019AC. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre une \u00e9vidence que l\u2019appelant se serait oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019AC s\u2019il l\u2019avait re\u00e7u en 2015.\n[20] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il pensait avoir droit au remboursement en cause et qu\u2019on le lui a garanti. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure que l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u l\u2019AC le 1er avril 2015, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pris aucune mesure.\n[21] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que si je conclus que l\u2019appelant a fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour susciter des doutes quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u l\u2019AC, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019ARC a envoy\u00e9 l\u2019AC le 1er avril 2015. Pour appuyer cette affirmation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 se fonde sur les t\u00e9moignages de ses deux t\u00e9moins.\nV. DISCUSSION [22] Les deux parties d\u00e9clarent, \u00e0 juste titre, que je devrais m\u2019appuyer sur la d\u00e9cision DaSilva c. La Reine, 2018 CCI 74 dans ma discussion.\n[23] Dans la d\u00e9cision DaSilva, le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 quatre \u00e9tapes \u00e0 appliquer, lorsqu\u2019un contribuable all\u00e8gue qu\u2019un AC \u00e9tabli en application de la Loi n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9, est reproduit.\n(1) \u00c9tape 1 [24] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 1, le contribuable doit affirmer que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par le ministre, soit en affirmant 1) ne pas avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019AC et croire donc qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9, soit 2) en affirmant que l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9 \u00e0 la mauvaise adresse, sans que ce soit de sa faute[3].\n[25] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que si l\u2019affirmation du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 1 n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante[4].\n[26] L\u2019appelant n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la mauvaise adresse, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il vivait dans le bien vis\u00e9 par la demande de remboursement au moment de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation. Au lieu de cela, l\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019AC n\u2019avait gu\u00e8re \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 en avril 2015.\n[27] Pour appuyer cette all\u00e9gation, l\u2019appelant a simplement indiqu\u00e9 ne pas avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019AC. Il est un particulier qui n\u2019a pas produit de d\u00e9clarations de revenus depuis 2003. Il ne se montre donc pas \u00eatre une personne diligente dans le traitement de ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus.\n[28] Il est presque certain que l\u2019appelant ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait d\u2019affirmer de fa\u00e7on cr\u00e9dible que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u. Il a juste soutenu ne pas avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019AC qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015 ou vers cette date. Pour ce motif, j\u2019accueillerais la requ\u00eate de la Couronne. Cependant, je discuterai aussi des autres \u00e9tapes indiqu\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision DaSilva.\n(2) \u00c9tape 2 [29] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 2 du crit\u00e8re, si la Cour conclut que l\u2019appelant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait d\u2019affirmer de fa\u00e7on cr\u00e9dible que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par le ministre, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour prouver que l\u2019AC a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9. La norme de preuve est celle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s[5].\n[30] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015.\n[31] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, au paragraphe 27, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a, \u00e0 juste titre, expliqu\u00e9 ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en ces termes : [traduction]\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 trois affidavits de deux fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC pour d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015. Dans l\u2019affidavit souscrit par Anujan Kumaranathan le 14 septembre 2023, il est indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 dans le cycle 000006840 du Syst\u00e8me de communication avec les entreprises (le \u00ab SCE \u00bb) de l\u2019ARC qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 le 28 mars 2015 avec un avis dat\u00e9 du 1er avril 2015[6]. L\u2019affidavit de Wade Smith, gestionnaire au sein du service d\u2019impression-courrier situ\u00e9 au centre fiscal de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada sur l\u2019\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard, souscrit le 12 septembre 2023, indique que le cycle 000006840 du SCE a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9 et post\u00e9 \u00e0 temps[7]. L\u2019affidavit d\u2019Anujan Kumaranathan, souscrit le 7 septembre 2023, indique qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de conclure qu\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par l\u2019ARC au plus tard le 30 juin 2015, ou qu\u2019une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019opposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par l\u2019ARC au plus tard le 30 juin 2016. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9[8].\n[32] M. Kumaranathan a comparu devant le tribunal et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9.\n[33] L\u2019appelant affirme que la Cour ne devrait pas retenir la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, au motif que ni M. Kumaranathan ni M. Smith n\u2019avaient une [traduction] \u00ab connaissance personnelle \u00bb de l\u2019envoi de l\u2019AC. L\u2019appelant affirme que les affidavits de MM. Smith et Kumaranathan manquent de d\u00e9tails et que M. Smith se fonde, du moins en partie, sur les renseignements que d\u2019autres lui ont communiqu\u00e9s. Il all\u00e8gue que les affidavits reposent sur un mod\u00e8le d\u2019affidavit type et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas des plus pr\u00e9cis. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne devrais accorder aucune importance \u00e0 leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[34] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019analyse de l\u2019appelant. M\u00eame si j\u2019aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Smith indique dans son affidavit \u00e0 quel moment il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019ARC, cette information manquante ne constitue toutefois pas un motif suffisant pour rejeter son t\u00e9moignage. \u00c0 tous autres \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contiennent les renseignements sur lesquels je souhaite statuer. Je conclus donc que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire au deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re. Je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, au 3, avenue Matthewson, le 1er avril 2015.\n(3) \u00c9tape 3 [35] Ayant conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019AC avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015, l\u2019AC est alors r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par l\u2019appelant le 1er avril 2015. En revanche, selon l\u2019\u00e9tape 3 du crit\u00e8re, l\u2019appelant peut n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour r\u00e9futer cette pr\u00e9somption et prouver que l\u2019AC a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre date[9].\n[36] Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019appelant se fonde en grande partie sur les notes et documents obtenus \u00e0 la suite de la demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP, pour conclure que l\u2019AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en avril 2015.\n[37] Je ne trouve pas que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant permettent de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 2. Les conclusions que l\u2019appelant me demande de tirer, notamment le fait que l\u2019AC \u00e9tait antidat\u00e9, ne peuvent pas \u00eatre raisonnablement tir\u00e9es des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[38] \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, l\u2019appelant se fonde sur une annotation dans la note au dossier pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le v\u00e9rificateur de l\u2019ARC le 26 mars 2015 qui indique dossier envoy\u00e9 pour examen comme preuve qu\u2019un AC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015. [10]. Je n\u2019interpr\u00e8te pas cette inscription de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. \u00c0 mes yeux, ce commentaire, court et sans contexte, n\u2019a aucune valeur probante.\n[39] L\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue aussi que le fait que le ministre ne disposait pas des pi\u00e8ces exactes quant au num\u00e9ro d\u2019assurance sociale et \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de l\u2019appelant signifiait que le ministre ne pouvait pas avoir envoy\u00e9 l\u2019AC \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en 2015. Cet argument est fond\u00e9 sur une hypoth\u00e8se erron\u00e9e, car il ne tient pas compte du fait que l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 le remboursement et indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019adresse du bien vis\u00e9 par la demande de remboursement dans le formulaire de demande. Je n\u2019ai aucun doute que le ministre avait l\u2019adresse de l\u2019appelant qui r\u00e9sidait au 3, avenue Matthewson, Bradford (Ontario) en 2015. L\u2019adresse est en fait indiqu\u00e9e dans la note au dossier sur laquelle l\u2019appelant s\u2019appuie.\n[40] L\u2019appelant souligne ensuite que les pi\u00e8ces fournies \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP comprenaient un projet d\u2019AC. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019AC qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9 n\u2019existe pas et n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015. J\u2019arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019existence d\u2019un projet d\u2019AC ne t\u00e9moigne pas de l\u2019inexistence d\u2019une version d\u00e9finitive de l\u2019AC. Le projet d\u2019AC est par ailleurs la m\u00eame chose que l\u2019AC envoy\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du filigrane [traduction] \u00ab Projet \u00bb. \u00c0 ce sujet, notre Cour pr\u00e9f\u00e8re les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les deux fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC \u00e0 la conclusion d\u00e9favorable que l\u2019appelant demande \u00e0 notre Cour de tirer du projet de cotisation dans le dossier de demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP.\n[41] En fin de compte, l\u2019appelant me demande de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9sultats de la demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Il est une fois encore question du fait que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP ne fournissait qu\u2019un projet d\u2019AC. Il invoque le paragraphe 30(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada pour avancer cet argument.\n[42] Son argument repose sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e du paragraphe 30(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. L\u2019appelant mentionne les pi\u00e8ces fournies \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019AIPRP pour chercher \u00e0 obtenir une conclusion d\u00e9favorable. M\u00eame si je devais appliquer le paragraphe 30(2), ce paragraphe pr\u00e9cise que le tribunal peut tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable. Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne tirerai pas la conclusion d\u00e9favorable demand\u00e9e.\n[43] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire ou de t\u00e9moignages pour r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle l\u2019AC a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 1er avril 2015, comme cela est indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 2 du crit\u00e8re.\n(4) \u00c9tape 4 [44] Selon l\u2019\u00e9tape 4 du crit\u00e8re, une cotisation est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la date \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 2 ou 3 et un AC est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par le destinataire \u00e0 cette date[11].\n[45] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u l\u2019AC \u00e0 la date de son envoi, le 1er avril 2015. Un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la Loi par l\u2019appelant.\n[46] Aucun avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus par la Loi, la condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 306 de la Loi pour interjeter appel de la cotisation n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie. L\u2019appel est donc annul\u00e9.\n[47] Chaque partie assumera ses propres d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 30e jour d\u2019avril 2024.\n\u00ab R.

Introduction\n[1] La Couronne intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en annulation du pr\u00e9sent appel au motif que la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, M. Scott Gillies, ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour.\n[2] M. Gillies demande \u00e0 la Cour de conclure, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas redevable au ministre du Revenu national (ministre) de l\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu par la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) que son employeur de l\u2019\u00e9poque, Love That River Inc. (\u00ab LTRI \u00bb), a retenu sur le revenu qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas vers\u00e9 au ministre.\nII. Contexte\n[3] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada fait valoir que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019objection pr\u00e9liminaire [\u2026] [est que] [\u2026] dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant cherche \u00e0 interjeter appel de la cotisation \u00e9tablie pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017, aucun recours ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 devant notre honorable Cour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u00fb en vertu de la Loi \u00bb [1].\n[4] Selon la r\u00e9ponse, LTRC a produit des feuillets T4 modifi\u00e9s pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017, indiquant qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces ann\u00e9es[2].\n[5] De plus, selon la r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019appelant avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un imp\u00f4t sur le revenu d\u00e9duit pour 2016 de 54 900 $, montant que le ministre a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 49 844 $ lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation. De m\u00eame, pour l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de 2017 d\u00e9duit, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 28 063 $, montant que le ministre a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 19 744 $ apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation[3].\n[6] M. Gillies a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, par la suite, LTRI a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un employ\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait donc responsable de ses versements au ministre relativement aux retenues obligatoires.\n[7] Cette affirmation de LTRI a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par une d\u00e9cision du ministre. Cette d\u00e9cision est indiqu\u00e9e dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Gillies par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) au nom du ministre, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9e le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2017 (pi\u00e8ce A\u20111.) La lettre informait que le ministre maintenait une d\u00e9cision rendue le 27 septembre 2017 en vertu du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada et de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi selon laquelle la relation de l\u2019appelant avec LTRC avait satisfait aux exigences d\u2019un contrat de travail et que, par cons\u00e9quent, une relation employeur\u2011employ\u00e9 existait entre LTRC \u00e0 titre d\u2019employeur et l\u2019appelant \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[8] Tel que je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, la pr\u00e9occupation constante de l\u2019appelant est que le ministre s\u2019adresse \u00e0 lui pour recouvrer l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2016 et 2017, que LTRC avait retenu, mais non vers\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 une entente avec LRTC selon laquelle, en \u00e9change du paiement d\u2019une somme convenue pour cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9, il ne poursuivrait pas LRTC pour les retenues non vers\u00e9es.\n[9] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gillies pourquoi il avait port\u00e9 cette affaire devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Il a r\u00e9pondu en citant la lettre susmentionn\u00e9e (pi\u00e8ce A-1) de l\u2019ARC envoy\u00e9e au nom du ministre le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2017. Elle indiquait que s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision selon laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 de LTRC, il [traduction] \u00ab peut interjeter appel devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [\u2026] \u00bb. Bien entendu, il est tr\u00e8s satisfait de cette d\u00e9cision du ministre. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il demande une d\u00e9cision tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente.\nIII. Analyse\n[10] Dans ce contexte, je reviens maintenant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate susmentionn\u00e9e de la Couronne intim\u00e9e visant l\u2019annulation de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Dans la r\u00e9ponse, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral affirme que notre Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour [traduction] \u00ab lib\u00e9rer l\u2019appelant de l\u2019obligation de payer l\u2019imp\u00f4t dont il est redevable en vertu de l\u2019article 222 de la Loi \u00bb [4].\n[11] \u00c9galement dans la r\u00e9ponse, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [traduction] \u00ab admet que l\u2019employeur est responsable de verser au ministre toute retenue d\u2019imp\u00f4t des employ\u00e9s \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab admet \u00e9galement que l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas vers\u00e9 l\u2019imp\u00f4t retenu sur le revenu de l\u2019appelant \u00bb [5].\n[12] Pour faire valoir que cette proc\u00e9dure devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e, les avocates de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Boucher c. Sa Majest\u00e9, 2004 CAF 47, qui faisait suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (la \u00ab CAF \u00bb) Neuhaus c. Canada, 2002 CAF 391, dans laquelle le juge No\u00ebl, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit (paragraphes 4 \u00e0 6) :\n4. Or, en l\u2019occurrence, la demanderesse ne recherche pas l\u2019annulation ou la modification des cotisations en litige. Elle pr\u00e9tend plut\u00f4t que les imp\u00f4ts tels que cotis\u00e9s par le Ministre ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par voie de retenue \u00e0 la source (voir l\u2019article 227 (9.4) [sic] qui rend inter alia l\u2019employeur responsable des imp\u00f4ts d\u00fbs [sic.] par un employ\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence des montants retenus \u00e0 m\u00eame le salaire et non remis). Dans ces circonstances, c\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que la premi\u00e8re juge [de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t] s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e sans juridiction et c\u2019est donc \u00e0 tort qu\u2019elle s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur le fond du litige.\n5. Le probl\u00e8me soulev\u00e9 par la demanderesse en est un de recouvrement. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019article 222 [de la Loi] conf\u00e8re comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en ces termes :\nTous les imp\u00f4ts, int\u00e9r\u00eats, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, frais et autres montants payables en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi sont des dettes envers Sa Majest\u00e9 et recouvrables comme telles devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [\u2026]\n6. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la demanderesse pr\u00e9tend avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 pay\u00e9 les imp\u00f4ts qu\u2019on lui r\u00e9clame, elle pourra faire valoir ses droits devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsque le Ministre tentera de recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re exigibles [\u2026]\n[13] En 2004, l\u2019article 222 de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9 et est devenu le paragraphe 222(2), intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Cr\u00e9ances de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00bb, qui pr\u00e9voit :\nLa dette fiscale est une cr\u00e9ance de Sa Majest\u00e9 et est recouvrable \u00e0 ce titre devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou devant tout autre tribunal comp\u00e9tent ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[14] Dans la d\u00e9cision Boucher, la CAF a cit\u00e9 avec approbation au paragraphe 8 les m\u00eames paragraphes de l\u2019affaire Neuhaus. Les paragraphes 10 et 11 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Boucher, rendu par la juge Sharlow de la Cour d\u2019appel, sont ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9s :\n10. [\u2026] le Parlement n\u2019a pas investi la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t du pouvoir de trancher un diff\u00e9rend qui porte sur la question de savoir si l\u2019imp\u00f4t a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu \u00e0 la source pour certains paiements.\n11. La seule r\u00e9paration possible est d\u2019accueillir le pr\u00e9sent appel [\u00e0 la CAF], d\u2019annuler le jugement de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et de le remplacer par un jugement qui annule l\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t [\u2026]\n[15] Dans l\u2019affaire Reese McIntosh c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine, 2011 CCI 147, mon coll\u00e8gue le juge D\u2019Arcy a examin\u00e9 une situation quelque peu similaire. Il a conclu ce qui suit aux paragraphes 19 \u00e0 21 :\n19. Il ressort clairement [\u2026] que la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour est limit\u00e9e aux appels interjet\u00e9s d\u2019une cotisation. Il s\u2019agit seulement des appels interjet\u00e9s d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie en vertu de la Loi (voir les observations du juge Rip (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) dans McMillen Holdings Limited c. The Minister of National Revenue, 87 DTC 585, aux pages 591 \u00e0 592).\n20. Le ministre est tenu, aux termes de l\u2019article 152(1) [sic] de la Loi, d\u2019\u00e9tablir une cotisation de l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e au titre de la Loi. Je retiens la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle le paragraphe 152(1) de la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas le calcul de l\u2019\u00ab imp\u00f4t d\u00fb \u00bb apr\u00e8s que les retenues \u00e0 la source ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, et, par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour cr\u00e9diter \u00e0 l\u2019appelant les retenues \u00e0 la source d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu suppl\u00e9mentaires dont il fait \u00e9tat.\n21. Ma conclusion est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019enseignement de la Cour dans la d\u00e9cision Liu c. Her Majesty The Queen, [1995] 2 C.T.C. 2971 [\u2026] et \u00e0 celui de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuhaus c. R. [\u2026]\nIV. Conclusion\n[16] Je vais rendre un jugement annulant le pr\u00e9sent appel au motif que la Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la question d\u2019un employeur qui a retenu, mais non vers\u00e9, l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable en vertu de la Loi, ce qui constitue un \u00ab probl\u00e8me de recouvrement \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 222(2) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, lequel attribue comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il n\u2019y aura pas d\u2019adjudication de d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 30\u1d49 jour d\u2019avril 2024.\n\u00ab B.

Chacune de ces nouvelles cotisations a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie (envoy\u00e9e) le 24 ao\u00fbt 2006.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sent appel soit rejet\u00e9 au motif qu\u2019aucun avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai imparti en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de ces nouvelles cotisations. Or, le paragraphe 169(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le contribuable qui souhaite interjeter appel devant la Cour concernant une cotisation ou une nouvelle cotisation doit d\u2019abord avoir signifi\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la cotisation ou de la nouvelle cotisation en vertu de l\u2019article 165 de cette loi.\n[3] Le paragraphe 165(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que, pour \u00eatre valable, l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition d\u2019un contribuable autre qu\u2019une fiducie doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 au plus tard au dernier en date des jours suivants, \u00e0 savoir (1) le jour qui tombe un an apr\u00e8s la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de production qui est applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en cause (en l\u2019occurrence les 30 avril 2001, 30 avril 2002, 30 avril 2003 et 30 avril 2004 respectivement pour les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles de nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies) et (2) le quatre-vingt-dixi\u00e8me jour suivant la date d\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis de cotisation (\u00e0 savoir le quatre-vingt-dixi\u00e8me jour suivant le 24 ao\u00fbt 2006, soit le mercredi 22 novembre 2006).\n[4] Par ailleurs, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 166.1(7)a) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le contribuable peut demander une prorogation du d\u00e9lai applicable \u00e0 la signification d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant l\u2019expiration de ce dernier, tel que calcul\u00e9 selon la plus tardive des dates susmentionn\u00e9es.

Le 18 janvier 2022, le ministre a pris connaissance du soi-disant avis d\u2019opposition sous forme \u00e9lectronique dat\u00e9 du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2021 et a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas accepter son opposition en application du paragraphe 165(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, car cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans les 90 jours suivant la date de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations. En outre, le ministre a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019aucune demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai applicable au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition ne saurait \u00eatre accueillie au titre du paragraphe 166.1(7) de la Loi, car une telle demande devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la date limite \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019opposition pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.

Schroeder a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour de la cotisation \u00e9tablie par le ministre du Revenu national (le ministre) en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (S.R.C., 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.), telle que modifi\u00e9e (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb)) pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021.\n[3] Dans la d\u00e9claration de revenus qu\u2019il a produite pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, M. Schroeder a demand\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction de 22 000 $ en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)c) de la LIR, appel\u00e9e \u00ab D\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9 \u00bb. Cette d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e au motif que M. Schroeder n\u2019avait tir\u00e9 aucun revenu d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021.\n[4] En outre, le ministre a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que M. Schroeder n\u2019avait pas fourni \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada le formulaire T1223 prescrit pour la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9 (le \u00ab formulaire T1223 \u00bb), formulaire qui constitue une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction en vertu du paragraphe 8(10) de la LIR.\n[5] Lors de l\u2019audience, M. Schroeder s\u2019est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et fiable.

FAITS\n[8] M. Schroeder est un membre du clerg\u00e9 certifi\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9. Il a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me de premier cycle de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta puis a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 une ma\u00eetrise en th\u00e9ologie \u00e0 la North American Baptist Divinity School et un doctorat en th\u00e9ologie pratique au North American Baptist Seminary (en 1992). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019\u00e9glise North American Baptist Denomination en 1983 (voir pi\u00e8ces A-1, A-2 et A-3).\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir servi dans sa paroisse pendant plus de 40 ans, M. Schroeder a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 en avril 2020 de son poste d\u2019eccl\u00e9siastique et de pasteur principal de la Kelowna Trinity Baptist Church (l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9glise \u00bb).\n[10] Apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9mission, M. Schroeder a communiqu\u00e9 avec la Kelowna Trinity Baptist Church Legacy Foundation (la \u00ab Fondation \u00bb) pour savoir si la Fondation voudrait assurer son financement afin qu\u2019il fournisse des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la \u00ab GRC \u00bb) dans la r\u00e9gion de Kelowna.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s une rencontre informelle entre M. Shroeder et les administrateurs de la Fondation, cette derni\u00e8re a accept\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer M. Shroeder directement pour ses services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aupr\u00e8s des membres et du personnel de la GRC. La Fondation et M. Schroeder, sous le nom de \u00ab Tim Schroeder National Ministry TS67 \u00bb, ont conclu une convention de mandat officialisant leur accord. Le contrat devait entrer en vigueur le 15 avril 2020 et prendre fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2021 (la \u00ab convention de mandat \u00bb) (voir pi\u00e8ce A-8).\n[12] Comme l\u2019indique monsieur B.D. \u00ab Brad \u00bb Haugli, surintendant principal, chef de district, district du Sud-Est de la GRC, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 novembre 2023, M. Schroeder, en tant qu\u2019aum\u00f4nier [traduction] \u00ab [...] procure \u00e0 la fois un soutien strat\u00e9gique et pr\u00e9ventif \u00e0 nos membres en mati\u00e8re de bien-\u00eatre, en plus de leur fournir une aide appropri\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019ils sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des incidents traumatisants \u00bb (voir la pi\u00e8ce A-4). Selon ce qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans cette m\u00eame lettre, et comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Schroeder lui-m\u00eame lors de l\u2019audience, M. Schroeder fournit ces services dans une vaste r\u00e9gion du sud-est de la Colombie-Britannique, \u00e0 raison de quelque 110 heures par mois, gr\u00e2ce au parrainage de la Fondation. Cette r\u00e9gion comprend quatre districts de la GRC.\n[13] M. Schroeder a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 Kelowna, il \u00e9tait le seul aum\u00f4nier r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 offrant des services \u00e0 plus de 300 membres et employ\u00e9s de la GRC. Sept aum\u00f4niers b\u00e9n\u00e9voles fournissaient \u00e9galement des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC.\n[14] En racontant comment se passait une semaine type, M. Schroeder a dit qu\u2019il assistait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance d\u2019information \u00e0 Kelowna, suivie d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec le surintendant principal du district du Sud-Est de la GRC. Lorsque des \u00e9v\u00e9nements bouleversants et tragiques se produisaient, il se rendait sur des lieux pr\u00e9cis pour apporter son soutien aux membres et au personnel de la GRC.\n[15] La GRC prenait en charge les \u00ab frais fixes \u00bb de M. Schroeder, notamment le co\u00fbt de ses repas et de ses d\u00e9placements, en plus de lui verser une indemnit\u00e9 journali\u00e8re. La Fondation payait pour son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable. En outre, la Fondation remboursait M. Shroeder lorsqu\u2019il engageait des d\u00e9penses, comme lorsqu\u2019il achetait des v\u00eatements d\u2019aum\u00f4nier pour les aum\u00f4niers b\u00e9n\u00e9voles et pour lui-m\u00eame. M. Schroeder utilisait son v\u00e9hicule personnel pour se d\u00e9placer entre les diff\u00e9rents lieux o\u00f9 il fournissait des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC.\n[16] Au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale 2021, la Fondation a vers\u00e9 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 M. Schroeder deux fois par mois. M. Schroeder a re\u00e7u un montant total de 66 000 $ (soit 2 750 $ x 24) de la part de la Fondation au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021 (voir pi\u00e8ce A-9), montant qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme un \u00ab revenu d\u2019un travail ind\u00e9pendant de profession lib\u00e9rale \u00bb. M. Schroeder a demand\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction pour l\u2019utilisation de son v\u00e9hicule personnel au titre de d\u00e9pense professionnelle aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. M. Schroeder a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des revenus de pension totalisant 21 949 $. Toutefois, au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021, M. Schroeder n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi.\n[17] M. Schroeder a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il rencontrait [traduction] \u00ab au moins une fois par trimestre \u00bb les membres de la Fondation pour les tenir au courant de ses activit\u00e9s.\nIV. QUESTION \u00c0 TRANCHER\n[18] La seule question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de savoir si la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration vers\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Schroeder par la Fondation au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021 constitue un revenu tir\u00e9 \u00ab d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi \u00bb, de sorte que M. Schroeder aurait droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)c), pour un montant total de 22 000 $.\n[19] Lors de l\u2019audience, le d\u00e9fendeur a admis que M. Schroeder avait d\u00fbment soumis le formulaire T1223 \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (voir pi\u00e8ce A-7). En outre, le d\u00e9fendeur a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour que le statut et la fonction de M. Schroeder, tel que vis\u00e9s par les sous-alin\u00e9as 8(1)c)(i) et (ii), n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contest\u00e9s; il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019opposition quant aux sommes vers\u00e9es par la Fondation \u00e0 M. Schroeder \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021, ni quant au montant de la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9 demand\u00e9e.\nV. CONCLUSION\n[20] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, M. Schroeder est un employ\u00e9 de la Fondation et a donc per\u00e7u un revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019un emploi de la part de la Fondation au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021. L\u2019appel est accueilli, sans d\u00e9pens; M. Schroeder a droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9 d\u2019un montant total de 22 000 $ en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)c).\nVI. POSITION DES PARTIES\n[21] M. Schroeder fait valoir qu\u2019il a droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue de la Fondation constitue un revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00ab emploi \u00bb. Selon M. Schroeder, lorsque les facteurs pertinents sont appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 sa relation avec la Fondation, ils d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019il a agi \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 de la Fondation et non pas comme entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. Dans le cadre de la convention de mandat, il a exerc\u00e9 les m\u00eames fonctions ou des fonctions similaires \u00e0 celles qu\u2019il exer\u00e7ait en tant que pasteur au sein de l\u2019\u00e9glise et devrait donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un employ\u00e9. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, M. Schroeder fait valoir que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue de la Fondation constitue un revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00ab charge \u00bb, ce qui lui donne droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9.\n[22] Le d\u00e9fendeur soutient que M. Schroeder n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un membre du clerg\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas per\u00e7u de revenu provenant \u00ab d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi \u00bb au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021. Le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intention subjective et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective de la relation entre la Fondation et M. Schroeder \u00e9taient que M. Schroeder \u00e9tait un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et non un employ\u00e9 de la Fondation.\nVII. ANALYSE\n[23] Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, tant le crit\u00e8re relatif au statut (sous-alin\u00e9a 8(1)c)(i)) que le crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 la fonction (sous-alin\u00e9a 8(1)c)(ii)) sont remplis. La seule question \u00e0 trancher dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel est de d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que M. Schroeder a re\u00e7ue de la part de la Fondation constitue un revenu provenant d\u2019une charge ou d\u2019un emploi, ou s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un revenu qu\u2019il a per\u00e7u en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant (ou \u00e0 titre de revenu de profession lib\u00e9rale).\n[24] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si une personne est un employ\u00e9 engag\u00e9 au titre d\u2019un \u00ab contrat de louage de services \u00bb ou au titre d\u2019un \u00ab contrat d\u2019entreprise \u00bb, notre Cour doit v\u00e9rifier l\u2019ensemble de la relation entre les parties (Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.N.R., [1986] 3 C.F. 553 [Wiebe Door]).\n[25] La question centrale est de savoir \u00ab si la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e pour fournir les services les fournit en tant que personne travaillant \u00e0 son compte \u00bb (671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 CSC 59, par. 47 [Sagaz]).\n[26] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sagaz (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada approuve l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), o\u00f9 le juge MacGuigan fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux diff\u00e9rents facteurs qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, et r\u00e9sume les principes applicables comme suit :\n[47] [...] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il faut toujours prendre en consid\u00e9ration le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le que l\u2019employeur exerce sur les activit\u00e9s du travailleur. Cependant, il faut aussi se demander, notamment, si le travailleur fournit son propre outillage, s\u2019il engage lui-m\u00eame ses assistants, quelle est l\u2019\u00e9tendue de ses risques financiers, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point il est responsable des mises de fonds et de la gestion et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point il peut tirer profit de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[48] Ces facteurs, il est bon de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, ne sont pas exhaustifs et il n\u2019y a pas de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie de les appliquer. Leur importance relative respective d\u00e9pend des circonstances et des faits particuliers de l\u2019affaire.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[27] En abordant la question centrale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celle de savoir \u00ab si la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e pour fournir les services les fournit en tant que personne travaillant \u00e0 son compte \u00bb, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9fini dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) c. Canada (Revenu national), 2013 CAF 85 [Connor Homes] (par. 39 et suivants), une approche en deux \u00e9tapes qu\u2019il convient de suivre.\n[28] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 cerner l\u2019intention subjective de chacune des parties \u00e0 la relation. Pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention subjective des parties, il convient d\u2019examiner le contrat \u00e9crit qu\u2019elles ont pass\u00e9, ainsi que le comportement effectif de chacune d\u2019elles, par exemple en examinant les factures des services rendus, et les points de savoir si la personne physique int\u00e9ress\u00e9e s\u2019est enregistr\u00e9e aux fins de la TPS et produit des d\u00e9clarations d\u2019imp\u00f4t en tant que travailleur autonome.\n[29] La seconde \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective confirme l\u2019intention subjective des parties. Les diff\u00e9rents facteurs d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) sont alors pertinents pour v\u00e9rifier si les faits de la situation sont compatibles avec l\u2019intention subjective des parties. Comme l\u2019indique la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Connor Homes, \u00ab [a]utrement dit, l\u2019intention subjective des parties ne peut l\u2019emporter sur la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la relation telle qu\u2019\u00e9tablie par les faits objectifs. \u00c0 cette seconde \u00e9tape, on peut aussi prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019intention des parties, ainsi que les modalit\u00e9s du contrat, puisqu\u2019elles influent sur leurs rapports. \u00bb (par. 40).\n[30] En outre, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en appliquant le crit\u00e8re, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape devrait toujours consister \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019intention des parties, pour ensuite \u00ab [...] examiner sous le prisme de cette intention la question de savoir si leurs rapports, concr\u00e8tement, r\u00e9v\u00e8le des rapports d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9 ou de client \u00e0 entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant \u00bb (voir Connor Homes, par. 42).\nA. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape : l\u2019intention subjective des parties\n[31] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, l\u2019intention subjective de la Fondation et de M. Schroeder \u00e9tait que leur relation soit une relation d\u2019employeur \u00e0 employ\u00e9.\n[32] Bien que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent que M. Schroeder a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue de la Fondation au titre de revenu de travail ind\u00e9pendant et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9duit les d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de son v\u00e9hicule personnel, je note que le formulaire T1223 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Fondation en tant qu\u2019\u00ab employeur \u00bb. Je tiens \u00e9galement compte du fait que M. Schroeder n\u2019a adress\u00e9 aucune facture \u00e0 la Fondation pour les services qu\u2019il a rendus aux membres et au personnel de la GRC.\n[33] Au cours de l\u2019audience, le d\u00e9fendeur a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 diverses dispositions de la convention de mandat conclue entre la Fondation et M. Schroeder pour appuyer la position selon laquelle M. Schroeder \u00e9tait un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant et non pas un employ\u00e9 de la Fondation. Par exemple, il a cit\u00e9 l\u2019article 10 de la convention de mandat, qui pr\u00e9voit que [traduction] \u00ab le repr\u00e9sentant national du minist\u00e8re [religieux] Tim Schroeder sera responsable de se conformer \u00e0 toutes les exigences en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9claration des salaires, de la TPS ou de toute autre obligation l\u00e9gale relative aux fonds d\u00e9pens\u00e9s au titre de ce minist\u00e8re \u00bb. La convention de mandat contient \u00e9galement une disposition exon\u00e9rant la Fondation de toute responsabilit\u00e9 et de toute d\u00e9pense li\u00e9e \u00e0 des dommages corporels pouvant r\u00e9sulter du travail de M. Shroeder.\n[34] Cependant, la convention de mandat contient aussi diverses dispositions indiquant que la Fondation contr\u00f4le certains aspects des activit\u00e9s professionnelles de M. Schroeder. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention de mandat, M. Schroeder, agissant en tant d\u2019agent, devait promouvoir les objectifs caritatifs de la Fondation en fournissant aux membres et au personnel de la GRC des services \u00e0 titre de ministre du culte. L\u2019article 3 de la convention de mandat pr\u00e9voit que des comptes rendus \u00e9crits seront fournis \u00e0 la Fondation tous les six mois et que la Fondation se r\u00e9serve le droit de contr\u00f4ler le d\u00e9roulement du projet. Par ailleurs, il est clair selon la formulation de la convention de mandat que la Fondation pr\u00e9voyait superviser le travail de M. Schroeder.\n[35] Ce type de convention de mandat est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement conclu par les organismes de bienfaisance pour s\u2019assurer de respecter les exigences de la LIR, afin de mener leurs propres activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance lorsque des agents sont engag\u00e9s pour mener \u00e0 bien un projet de l\u2019organisme de bienfaisance \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada.\n[36] Bien que M. Schroeder, en tant que \u00ab ministre national Tim Schroeder TS67 \u00bb, et la Fondation aient conclu un tel accord, je n\u2019accorde qu\u2019un poids modeste \u00e0 la convention de mandat dans mon analyse de l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par les ententes de ce type.\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape : la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 objective de la relation\n[37] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration tous les facteurs pertinents, je dois d\u00e9terminer si la relation entre les parties \u00e9tait, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, celle qu\u2019elles voulaient qu\u2019elle soit.\n[38] Pour les motifs qui suivent, apr\u00e8s avoir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 tous les facteurs pertinents, j\u2019estime que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, M. Schroeder \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de la Fondation et qu\u2019il a donc re\u00e7u de celle-ci un revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019un emploi au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2021.\n[39] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019estime que les facteurs pertinents \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration sont : le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le que la Fondation exer\u00e7ait sur les activit\u00e9s de M. Schroeder; le fait que M. Schroeder fournissait ou non son propre \u00e9quipement; la question de savoir si M. Schroeder avait ou non la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit en ex\u00e9cutant ses t\u00e2ches lorsqu\u2019il fournissait des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC; la question de savoir si M. Schroeder g\u00e9rait et assumait un risque de perte lorsqu\u2019il fournissait des services aux membres et au personnel de la GRC.\n(1) Degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le\n[40] La Fondation ne contr\u00f4lait pas l\u2019emploi du temps de M. Schroeder, ni son travail quotidien, ni ses activit\u00e9s. M. Schroeder n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de calendrier ou de relev\u00e9s d\u00e9taillant les activit\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques qu\u2019il a entreprises. M. Schroeder \u00e9tait \u00e9galement libre de fournir ses services de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il souhaitait.\n[41] Les exigences en mati\u00e8re de rapports \u00e0 la Fondation \u00e9taient minimes. Le d\u00e9fendeur a produit en preuve un rapport de projet semestriel fourni par M. Schroeder \u00e0 la Fondation; ce document ne donne qu\u2019un bref aper\u00e7u des activit\u00e9s de M. Schroeder (voir la pi\u00e8ce R-1, \u00ab Respondent\u2019s Book of Documents - Tab 2 - Six Month Project Review Report \u00bb (Cahier de preuves documentaires du d\u00e9fendeur, Onglet 2 \u2013 Rapport d\u2019examen semestriel du projet)).\n[42] Cependant, M. Schroeder devait fournir 110 heures par mois de services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC, et la GRC lui demandait de se rendre \u00e0 des endroits pr\u00e9cis pour fournir ces services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie. J\u2019ai suppos\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec le surintendant principal de la GRC, M. Schroeder devait se rendre l\u00e0 o\u00f9 ses services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires et utiles.\n[43] Bien que les faits susmentionn\u00e9s montrent que la Fondation exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le limit\u00e9 sur les activit\u00e9s et le travail quotidien de M. Schroeder, j\u2019estime que ce facteur indique une relation employ\u00e9-employeur entre M. Schroeder et la Fondation. M. Schroeder \u00e9tant engag\u00e9 par la Fondation pour fournir des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie professionnels et confidentiels, il est compr\u00e9hensible que la Fondation ait exerc\u00e9 moins de contr\u00f4le sur ses activit\u00e9s que sur celles d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ordinaire.\n[44] Pour \u00e9valuer ce facteur, j\u2019ai tenu compte du fait que M. Schroeder devait fournir des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC pendant au moins 110 heures par mois, et qu\u2019il devait offrir ses services partout o\u00f9 la GRC lui demandait de se rendre. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement tenu compte du fait qu\u2019il devait faire rapport \u00e0 la Fondation et qu\u2019il devait se comporter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019objectif de la Fondation. Ces exigences en mati\u00e8re de rapports et de conduite montrent que la Fondation exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le ou avait la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer un contr\u00f4le sur les activit\u00e9s de M. Schroeder.\n(2) \u00c9quipement\n[45] M. Schroeder a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il utilisait son v\u00e9hicule personnel pour se d\u00e9placer entre les diff\u00e9rents sites de la GRC. Il a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 son adresse \u00e9lectronique et son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable personnels pour communiquer dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s. M. Schroeder a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Fondation lui remboursait le co\u00fbt d\u2019autres outils ou accessoires dont il avait besoin dans le cadre de ses fonctions, et a donn\u00e9 comme exemple les vestes d\u2019aum\u00f4nier qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9 pour tous les aum\u00f4niers fournissant des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie \u00e0 la GRC.\n[46] L\u2019utilisation de son propre outillage pour fournir des services est un indice que cette personne fournit des services en tant qu\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant (Sagaz, par. 47). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule personnel pour des activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au travail est \u00e9galement une indication que l\u2019individu est un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant (Connor Homes, par. 50).\n[47] Compte tenu du nombre limit\u00e9 des pi\u00e8ces d\u2019\u00e9quipement n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie, mais compte tenu du fait que M. Schroeder a utilis\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule personnel pour fournir des services d\u2019aum\u00f4nerie aux membres et au personnel de la GRC, j\u2019estime que ce facteur appuie la conclusion selon laquelle M. Schroeder travaillait \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\n(3) Possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit et risque de perte\n[48] Si un travailleur peut augmenter le montant de son salaire en travaillant efficacement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien davantage de projets, il a la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit. Plus un travailleur a de possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9aliser un profit, plus cela indique qu\u2019il est un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant (voir AE Hospitality Ltd. c. M.N.R., 2019 CCI 116, par. 150, conf. par 2020 CAF 207). Le facteur de risque se rapporte au risque financier assum\u00e9 par l\u2019individu dans le cadre de la prestation de ses services. Ces facteurs doivent \u00eatre compris dans le sens entrepreneurial (voir 627148 Ontario Limited (Daily Care Health Services) c. M.N.R., 2013 CCI 169, au par. 27).\n[49] M. Schroeder a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec la Fondation apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 sa d\u00e9mission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9glise, afin de conclure l\u2019accord qui allait mener \u00e0 la convention de mandat. Le d\u00e9fendeur a fait valoir que cela indique qu\u2019il a pris un risque en concluant cet accord. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 ce point de vue.\n[50] M. Schroeder est pay\u00e9 par la Fondation deux fois par mois. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve ne montrent pas qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de pr\u00e9senter des calendriers ou des relev\u00e9s horaires pour \u00eatre pay\u00e9. M. Schroeder a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 travailler 110 heures par mois, mais qu\u2019il faisait souvent des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Qui plus est, rien n\u2019indique que M. Schroeder pourrait achever le projet \u00e9tabli dans la convention de mandat plus vite que pr\u00e9vu et r\u00e9aliser un profit gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette avanc\u00e9e rapide.\n[51] Mon examen des preuves m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que M. Schroeder n\u2019avait aucune possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9aliser un profit alors qu\u2019il fournissait ses services d\u2019aum\u00f4nier aux membres et au personnel de la GRC. En outre, les preuves ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Schroeder n\u2019a assum\u00e9 aucun risque de perte alors qu\u2019il fournissait ses services. J\u2019estime donc que les facteurs relatifs au profit et au risque permettent de conclure que M. Schroeder \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 de la Fondation.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 2e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Dominique Lafleur \u00bb\nLa juge Lafleur\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 56\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2023-1618(IT)I\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nPETER T.

Introduction\n[1] En 2019, Arlo Litman a construit une maison d\u2019all\u00e9e au-dessus d\u2019un garage isol\u00e9 sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa. En 2021, il a demand\u00e9 un remboursement pour habitations neuves de 17 372,38 $ \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, aux termes de l\u2019article 256 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, L.R.C. 1985, c. E-15 (la LTA). Le ministre du Revenu national (le ministre) a rejet\u00e9 la demande de remboursement, principalement au motif que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas effectu\u00e9 de r\u00e9novations majeures dans un logement.\n[2] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait construit la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e comme lieu de r\u00e9sidence pour sa belle-m\u00e8re, afin qu\u2019elle puisse vivre \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de sa fille et de ses petits-enfants, et vieillir sur place. Il affirme que sa belle-m\u00e8re y a v\u00e9cu sans interruption pendant plus d\u2019un an, mais qu\u2019en raison de changements survenus dans la famille, elle partage d\u00e9sormais son temps entre Ottawa et son appartement de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Waterloo, o\u00f9 vit son fils.\nII. Question en litige\n[3] La seule question en litige dans ce recours est de savoir si M.

J\u2019en parle tout au long des pr\u00e9sents motifs et leur texte complet se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A.\nIII. Faits\n[6] En 2016, l\u2019appelant a achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du 80 Huron Avenue North pour 810 000 $. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comprenait une maison et un garage isol\u00e9. La maison comporte quatre niveaux, avec un troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage mansard\u00e9 et un sous-sol am\u00e9nag\u00e9. La superficie de chaque niveau est d\u2019environ 1 000 pieds carr\u00e9s.\n[7] La maison d\u2019all\u00e9e repose sur le garage pr\u00e9existant, qui continue d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme garage. La maison d\u2019all\u00e9e comprend une cuisine, une salle de bains et une buanderie. Sa superficie est d\u2019environ 373 pieds carr\u00e9s, bien que son empreinte au sol soit d\u2019environ 651 pieds carr\u00e9s. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 que le garage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abaiss\u00e9, que les cloisons s\u00e8ches avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es, que la porte du garage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e, modifi\u00e9e et fix\u00e9e \u00e0 nouveau et qu\u2019une entr\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construite. La dalle de b\u00e9ton et les fondations sont rest\u00e9es en place, de m\u00eame que les poteaux. Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectrique a \u00e9t\u00e9 refait. Il y a un panneau \u00e9lectrique secondaire dans le garage et l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est \u00ab aliment\u00e9e \u00bb par le panneau principal de la maison; il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule facture d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Les canalisations d\u2019eaux us\u00e9es passent par la maison principale, tandis que la conduite de gaz va directement \u00e0 la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e.\n[8] La maison d\u2019all\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e comme Airbnb et n\u2019a jamais fait office de lieu de travail. La belle-m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re et unique occupante de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant a estim\u00e9 que s\u2019il vendait sa maison, il faudrait \u00e9galement vendre le garage et la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, car il ne pensait pas que la s\u00e9paration serait autoris\u00e9e.\n[9] En plus de t\u00e9moigner pour lui-m\u00eame, l\u2019appelant a appel\u00e9 Rayeed Choudhury, l\u2019agent des appels de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) charg\u00e9 de ce dossier. Au moment de son implication dans cette affaire, M. Choudhury avait environ quatre ans et demi d\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 ce poste. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il connaissait le remboursement pour les habitations neuves, mais a reconnu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de son premier dossier concernant une maison d\u2019all\u00e9e. J\u2019ai conclu que M. Choudhury \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement franc, mais son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a apport\u00e9 que tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve utiles, voire aucun. Je ne le lui reproche pas.\n[10] M. Choudhury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il connaissait les pratiques et les orientations de l\u2019ARC en mati\u00e8re de maisons d\u2019all\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 interroger M. Choudhury, en citant des exemples dans les documents administratifs de l\u2019ARC et en demandant lesquels \u00e9taient les plus similaires \u00e0 la situation de l\u2019appelant. Outre plusieurs questions hypoth\u00e9tiques, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Choudhury s\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec les renseignements contenus dans les documents de l\u2019ARC. Je conclus que ce qu\u2019un agent d\u2019appel peut penser de ce que l\u2019ARC a \u00e9crit dans ses documents administratifs publics n\u2019est pas pertinent pour l\u2019application de la loi aux circonstances de l\u2019appelant. M. Choudhury a affirm\u00e9 que les documents de l\u2019ARC, tels que le bulletin d\u2019information technique sur la TPS\/TVH B-092 (pi\u00e8ce A-10; [bulletin B-092]), offrent une orientation, mais ne sont pas d\u00e9terminants.\n[11] M. Choudhury a reconnu qu\u2019en examinant l\u2019objection de l\u2019appelant, il a conclu que les r\u00e9novations ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux exigences de r\u00e9novations majeures conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 256(2) de la LTA. Bien qu\u2019il ne figure pas parmi les motifs de refus du remboursement dans l\u2019avis de confirmation, M. Choudhury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un bien nouvellement construit. Il a conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une annexe \u00e0 une structure pr\u00e9existante, \u00e0 savoir le garage, qui faisait partie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la maison principale.\nIV. Les th\u00e8ses des parties\nLa position de l\u2019appelant\n[12] Dans sa demande, l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le remboursement pour habitations neuves au motif que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e constituait des r\u00e9novations majeures au garage pr\u00e9existant (voir la pi\u00e8ce A-4, Feuille de travail pour sommaire de construction; voir \u00e9galement les observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019appelant au paragraphe 18). Dans son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant soutient principalement que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e est un immeuble d\u2019habitation ayant fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures, mais il ajoute qu\u2019\u00e0 titre subsidiaire, la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e est une unit\u00e9 d\u2019habitation nouvellement construite.\n[13] Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a chang\u00e9 de position et s\u2019est concentr\u00e9 sur son argument selon lequel la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e avec le garage \u00e9tait un immeuble d\u2019habitation distinct nouvellement construit. Il a estim\u00e9 que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique \u00bb figurant au paragraphe 256(1) de la LTA parce qu\u2019elle comprend un immeuble d\u2019habitation qui ne contient pas plus de deux logements. Il a \u00e9galement fait valoir qu\u2019elle r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation figurant au paragraphe 123(1) de la LTA parce que [traduction] \u00ab la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e constitue un immeuble d\u2019habitation en soi \u00bb. Selon lui, l\u2019existence d\u2019un garage ne modifie pas le caract\u00e8re d\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation auparavant et qu\u2019il y en a maintenant un, de sorte qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un nouvel immeuble d\u2019habitation. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9molir enti\u00e8rement le garage et de repartir de z\u00e9ro pour construire la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e afin d\u2019avoir droit au remboursement.\n[14] Bien que l\u2019appelant ait parfois sembl\u00e9 confondre ses arguments, je traiterai ses observations sur les r\u00e9novations majeures comme un argument subsidiaire.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9nov\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re importante un immeuble d\u2019habitation et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas non plus construit un nouvel immeuble d\u2019habitation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant a droit au remboursement, il faut consid\u00e9rer la maison et le garage avec la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e comme un tout, car ils sont ins\u00e9parables.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que le garage s\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e9tait une d\u00e9pendance de la maison principale, de sorte que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e est une r\u00e9novation d\u2019un immeuble d\u2019habitation qui comprend la maison principale. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distinct, il ne peut pas y avoir de remboursement. Il a par la suite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas si un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distinct \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessairement une exigence. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que l\u2019appelant ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de la r\u00e9novation majeure, qui exige g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que la totalit\u00e9 ou la quasi-totalit\u00e9 d\u2019un b\u00e2timent, sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments structurels essentiels, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9e ou remplac\u00e9e, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme signifiant 90 %.\nV. Analyse\n[17] L\u2019appelant a invoqu\u00e9 le document technique sur la taxe sur les produits et services dans lequel l\u2019honorable Michael H. Wilson, ministre des Finances, a affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce syst\u00e8me de remboursement de taxes, le gouvernement respectera son engagement de veiller \u00e0 ce que le nouveau syst\u00e8me ne constitue pas un obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019abordabilit\u00e9 du logement au Canada \u00bb. (Pi\u00e8ce A-14, ao\u00fbt 1989, p. 19). L\u2019appelant a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la crise du logement, ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient tout aussi importantes aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019elles l\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l\u2019appelant a fait valoir que le refus du remboursement pour les maisons d\u2019all\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9liminerait la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un remboursement cl\u00e9 qui encouragerait autrement les constructions n\u00e9cessaires pour faire face \u00e0 la crise du logement. Cela pourrait \u00e0 son tour avoir une incidence sur la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019options de logement diversifi\u00e9es, diminuer l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 au logement et augmenter l\u2019\u00e9talement des banlieues, entre autres incidences \u00bb (observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019appelant, par. 9).\n[18] Il faudrait avoir la t\u00eate enfouie dans le sable pour ne pas reconna\u00eetre que le Canada est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une crise nationale du logement et que des mesures sont prises pour relever ce d\u00e9fi. Cela dit, je dois tenir compte du fait que la disposition relative au remboursement pour habitations neuves en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel compte de nombreuses restrictions et conditions qui doivent \u00eatre remplies, faute de quoi le remboursement n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9. La disposition relative aux remboursements est une exception \u00e0 l\u2019objectif de la LTA, qui est de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des recettes publiques. J\u2019adopte le point de vue exprim\u00e9 dans des affaires ant\u00e9rieures d\u00e9crivant la disposition relative au remboursement comme une exception limit\u00e9e et, en outre, comme une exception soigneusement adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019application de la TPS (voir Canada c. Sneyd, 2000 CanLII 15708 (CAF), par. 13; Erickson c. La Reine, 2001 CanLII 569 (CCI), par. 15).\n[19] Je vais maintenant examiner les exigences particuli\u00e8res du paragraphe 256(2) de la LTA pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant au remboursement pour habitations neuves. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la condition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)a) de la LTA, l\u2019appelant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019en faisant construire la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e au-dessus d\u2019un garage pr\u00e9existant, il a soit construit, soit r\u00e9nov\u00e9 en grande partie un immeuble d\u2019habitation qui est un \u00ab immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique \u00bb. Cette derni\u00e8re expression est d\u00e9finie au paragraphe 256(1) comme incluant \u00ab un immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logements multiples ne contenant pas plus de deux habitations \u00bb. L\u2019expression \u00ab immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logements multiples \u00bb est d\u00e9finie au paragraphe 123(1) de la LTA comme signifiant un \u00ab immeuble d\u2019habitation, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion d\u2019un immeuble d\u2019habitation en copropri\u00e9t\u00e9, qui contient au moins deux habitations \u00bb. La d\u00e9finition d\u2019une \u00ab habitation \u00bb se trouve au paragraphe 123(1) de la LTA. Le terme est d\u00e9fini comme incluant une maison individuelle, une maison jumel\u00e9e, une unit\u00e9 en copropri\u00e9t\u00e9, une maison mobile, un appartement ou des locaux similaires et a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re large. Je conclus que la maison de l\u2019appelant, d\u00e9crite plus haut, est un appartement ou un local similaire et qu\u2019elle r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019habitation.\n[20] Bien que les d\u00e9finitions soient quelque peu circulaires, le remboursement est destin\u00e9 aux habitations qui ne contiennent pas plus de deux logements. Dans ces circonstances, que nous consid\u00e9rions l\u2019ensemble de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris la maison principale et la maison attenante, ou que nous ne consid\u00e9rions que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e au-dessus du garage, et si l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre est un immeuble d\u2019habitation, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique.\n[21] Ayant ainsi d\u00e9cid\u00e9, je dois examiner la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019\u00ab immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00bb. Le principal argument de l\u2019appelant lors du proc\u00e8s, comme indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, est qu\u2019en construisant la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e au-dessus de son garage pr\u00e9existant, il a construit un nouvel immeuble d\u2019habitation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e \u00e9tait une habitation, mais pas un immeuble d\u2019habitation parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distinct. Le d\u00e9fendeur a fait valoir que la Cour devait consid\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris la maison principale, comme un tout, le garage \u00e9tant une d\u00e9pendance de la maison principale et du terrain.\n[22] L\u2019ARC a donn\u00e9 des indications sur la fa\u00e7on dont elle pourrait traiter les \u00ab appartements accessoires \u00bb aux fins du remboursement pour habitations neuves. Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du point de vue de l\u2019ARC, qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de droit et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas contraignant pour cette Cour. Toutefois, comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, \u00ab [i]l est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019en cas de doute sur le sens d\u2019une disposition fiscale, la pratique administrative et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation adopt\u00e9es par le ministre ont un certain poids, bien qu\u2019elles ne soient pas des sources concluantes \u00bb (Placer Dome Canada Ltd. c. Ontario (Ministre des Finances), 2006 CSC 20, par. 10, citant Harel c. Sous-ministre du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 851).\n[23] Dans le bulletin B-092, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, l\u2019ARC \u00e9crit ce qui suit (aux pages 30-31) :\nLa construction d\u2019un appartement accessoire peut donner droit au remboursement pour habitations neuves dans n\u2019importe quelle des circonstances suivantes :\nl\u2019appartement est construit \u00e0 titre d\u2019ajout \u00e0 un b\u00e2timent existant qui fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures;\nl\u2019appartement est construit \u00e0 titre d\u2019ajout au b\u00e2timent existant et appartient, ou est cens\u00e9 appartenir, \u00e0 une personne en vertu d\u2019un titre distinct;\nun appartement autonome est s\u00e9par\u00e9 de la maison, de sorte qu\u2019il constitue un b\u00e2timent en soi. Dans cette situation, le remboursement serait fond\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019il y a un immeuble d\u2019habitation nouvellement construit, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un immeuble existant ayant fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures.\n[24] L\u2019ARC poursuit en donnant des exemples des situations d\u00e9crites ci-dessus. L\u2019exemple de \u00ab William L. \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 la construction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent distinct qui sera un appartement accessoire autonome, lequel ne lui appartiendra pas en vertu d\u2019un titre distinct, et sugg\u00e8re que William aurait droit au remboursement parce qu\u2019il a construit un immeuble d\u2019habitation neuf (bulletin B-092, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, p. 31). Ainsi, il semble que, selon l\u2019ARC, si la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construite directement sur le terrain plut\u00f4t que sur le garage pr\u00e9existant, et en supposant que toutes les autres conditions soient remplies, l\u2019appelant aurait eu droit au remboursement.\n[25] La question se pose de savoir si le fait que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 construite sur le garage pr\u00e9existant, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre autonome comme l\u2019appartement accessoire construit par William L. dans l\u2019exemple de l\u2019ARC, la disqualifie en tant qu\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation nouvellement construit. Je conclus que ce n\u2019est pas le cas. La maison d\u2019all\u00e9e est d\u00e9tach\u00e9e de la maison principale et forme un immeuble d\u2019habitation neuf l\u00e0 o\u00f9, avant sa construction, il n\u2019y en avait pas. En outre, je ne vois rien dans la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation qui exige que la maison de passage d\u2019all\u00e9e soit d\u00e9tenue en application d\u2019un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 distinct pour satisfaire aux exigences de cette d\u00e9finition. Et comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019exemple m\u00eame de l\u2019ARC indique le contraire.\n[26] Je note que les deux parties ont invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de notre Cour dans Lemieux c. La Reine (2009 CCI 17), dans laquelle le juge Tardif a conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas droit au remboursement pour habitations neuves. Dans Lemieux, l\u2019appelant avait construit une annexe, au-dessus d\u2019un garage pour deux voitures attach\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9sidence existante de 2 400 pieds carr\u00e9s. Je conclus que les circonstances de cette d\u00e9cision sont tellement diff\u00e9rentes de celles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019elles ne sont que peu, voire pas du tout, utiles pour trancher la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour.\n[27] J\u2019ai conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant concernant l\u2019occupation de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construite pour sa belle-m\u00e8re. Bien qu\u2019elle passe d\u00e9sormais une partie de son temps dans son appartement de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Waterloo o\u00f9 vivent son fils et sa famille, elle \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re et unique occupante et elle a v\u00e9cu dans la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e sans interruption pendant plus d\u2019un an. Je note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a convenu que si je devais conclure que la belle-m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant a v\u00e9cu dans la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e pendant un an, l\u2019appelant a satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence selon laquelle il s\u2019agit du lieu de r\u00e9sidence principal d\u2019un proche (voir les d\u00e9finitions de \u00ab proche \u00bb au paragraphe 256(1) et de \u00ab li\u00e9 \u00bb au paragraphe 126(2) de la LTA).\n[28] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que l\u2019appelant remplit la condition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les derniers mots de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)a) de la LTA, selon laquelle l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation doit servir de r\u00e9sidence habituelle \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses proches. Comme la belle-m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re et la seule personne \u00e0 occuper la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, la condition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)d) est \u00e9galement remplie.\n[29] \u00c0 ce stade, il convient de mentionner que la demande de remboursement pour habitations neuves (formulaire GST191), pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en septembre 2021, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Cour. En outre, lorsqu\u2019il soumet le formulaire GST191, le particulier qui fait la demande est tenu de remplir une Feuille de travail pour sommaire de construction (formulaire GST191-WS), et de la joindre au formulaire GST191. La feuille de travail compl\u00e8te n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a produit en preuve que les pages 1, 2 et 3 du document de 12 pages. La partie C du formulaire GST191-WS, pages 4 \u00e0 11, contient un tableau dans lequel le particulier qui demande le remboursement fournit des renseignements sur les d\u00e9tails de la construction et les factures, y compris le montant de la TPS pay\u00e9e. Malheureusement, et de mani\u00e8re surprenante, aucune des parties n\u2019a pens\u00e9 que le formulaire de demande et la feuille de travail compl\u00e8te constitueraient des renseignements utiles pour la Cour dans les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent appel. Cela renforce peut-\u00eatre l\u2019id\u00e9e que le fondement de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle le remboursement devrait \u00eatre refus\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exigence \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)c) de la LTA.\n[30] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)c) de la LTA exige que le particulier qui demande le remboursement ait pay\u00e9 la taxe sur le fonds qui fait partie de l\u2019immeuble ou sur toute am\u00e9lioration qui y est apport\u00e9e. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis que [traduction] \u00ab le ministre a refus\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelant au motif qu\u2019elle ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)a) \u00bb, mais a ni\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le ministre n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 les alin\u00e9as 256(2)b) \u00e0 d) de la Loi de mani\u00e8re plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e \u00bb (r\u00e9ponse, par. 7). L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas autrement cit\u00e9 une telle \u00ab contestation \u00bb. Selon la r\u00e9ponse, le ministre n\u2019a pas suppos\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait pay\u00e9 des imp\u00f4ts sur le fonds ou sur les am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es. En outre, dans les motifs invoqu\u00e9s dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a formul\u00e9 aucune observation concernant la condition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)c). Je conclus que, du fait qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9 la taxe sur les mat\u00e9riaux de construction et les services, ainsi que les frais tels que les honoraires de l\u2019architecte li\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant a satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence.\n[31] Pour pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du remboursement pour habitations neuves, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)b) de la LTA exige en outre que la juste valeur marchande de l\u2019immeuble, au moment o\u00f9 la construction ou les r\u00e9novations majeures sont achev\u00e9es, soit inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 450 000 $. La formule de calcul du remboursement pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 256(2) pr\u00e9voit que le remboursement est progressivement r\u00e9duit lorsque la juste valeur marchande de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9passe 350 000 $. Lorsque la juste valeur marchande atteint 450 000 $, le remboursement est totalement supprim\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision Somers c. La Reine, (2008 CCI 239, par. 4 [Somers]), le juge Webb a expliqu\u00e9 la pertinence de la juste valeur marchande aux fins du remboursement comme suit :\nPar cons\u00e9quent, si la juste valeur marchande de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait de 350 000 $ ou moins, la juste valeur marchande r\u00e9elle n\u2019est pas pertinente. Si la juste valeur marchande \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 350 000 $ et inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 450 000 $, la juste valeur marchande r\u00e9elle est pertinente, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la juste valeur marchande \u00e9tablie r\u00e9duirait le montant du remboursement pour habitations neuves qui serait par ailleurs accord\u00e9. Si la juste valeur marchande de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait de 450 000 $ ou plus, la juste valeur marchande r\u00e9elle n\u2019est pas pertinente, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun remboursement pour habitations neuves n\u2019est accord\u00e9 lorsque la juste valeur marchande d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 se situe dans cette fourchette.\n[32] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation, le terrain imm\u00e9diatement contigu au b\u00e2timent qui est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation et \u00e0 la jouissance du b\u00e2timent en tant que lieu de r\u00e9sidence doit \u00eatre inclus dans la d\u00e9termination de la juste valeur marchande.\n[33] L\u2019appelant a achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris la maison principale et le garage d\u00e9tach\u00e9, en 2016 pour 810 000 $. Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas droit au remboursement parce que la juste valeur marchande de la \u00ab propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb, d\u00e9finie comme comprenant la maison principale et la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, d\u00e9passait 450 000 $.\n[34] Toutefois, comme j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019appelant a construit un immeuble d\u2019habitation neuf lorsqu\u2019il a engag\u00e9 quelqu\u2019un pour construire la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, le remboursement doit \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 sur la base de la juste valeur marchande de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e et du terrain sur lequel elle se trouve. J\u2019ajouterais que cette conclusion est coh\u00e9rente avec les propres affirmations de l\u2019ARC dans l\u2019Info TPS\/TVH GI-168 (pi\u00e8ce A-11, p. 14-15).\n[35] Je reconnais que la d\u00e9finition de la juste valeur marchande accept\u00e9e par les tribunaux se trouve dans la d\u00e9cision Succession Henderson et Bank of New York c. M.R.N. (73 DTC 5471, p. 5476 (C.F. 1re inst.)) dans laquelle le juge Cattanach a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nDans son sens courant, me semble-t-il, cette expression d\u00e9signe le prix le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un bien peut raisonnablement s\u2019attendre \u00e0 tirer s\u2019il le vend de fa\u00e7on normale et dans le cours ordinaire des affaires, le march\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tant pas soumis \u00e0 des pressions inhabituelles et \u00e9tant constitu\u00e9 d\u2019acheteurs dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 acheter et des vendeurs dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 vendre, qui n\u2019ont entre eux aucun lien de d\u00e9pendance et qui ne sont en aucune fa\u00e7on oblig\u00e9s d\u2019acheter ou de vendre.\n[36] Aucune des parties n\u2019a fait appel \u00e0 un expert pour donner un avis sur la juste valeur marchande de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait tent\u00e9, en vain, de faire \u00e9valuer la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e. Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec deux \u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s qui lui ont tous deux r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019ils ne pouvaient pas fournir d\u2019\u00e9valuation, car il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments comparables (voir \u00e9galement la pi\u00e8ce A-4, le formulaire GST191-WS). Dans sa demande de remboursement, l\u2019appelant a utilis\u00e9 les co\u00fbts de construction de 255 607,90 $, auxquels il a ajout\u00e9 100 000 $ pour tenir compte de la valeur du terrain (voir la pi\u00e8ce A-4, formulaire GST191-WS).\n[37] Dans la d\u00e9cision Qureshi c. La Reine (2006 CCI 485, par. 10), le juge en chef Bowman, tel \u00e9tait alors son titre, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l n\u2019y a tout simplement rien qui puisse justifier l\u2019utilisation du co\u00fbt ou du co\u00fbt de remplacement pour \u00e9valuer le bien lorsqu\u2019il existe un march\u00e9 de biens comparables \u00bb. J\u2019ajouterai que dans la d\u00e9cision Somers, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le juge Webb n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 le co\u00fbt comme m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation appropri\u00e9e, car il y avait des preuves de biens comparables \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant selon lequel il n\u2019a pas pu obtenir une \u00e9valuation de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de deux \u00e9valuateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s qui n\u2019ont pas pu trouver d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments comparables. Je conclus que lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de march\u00e9 vers lequel se tourner, les co\u00fbts de construction qui repr\u00e9sentent les d\u00e9penses sur lesquelles la TPS a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e peuvent constituer une m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation appropri\u00e9e, bien qu\u2019imparfaite.\n[38] Dans sa demande de remboursement, l\u2019appelant a utilis\u00e9 les co\u00fbts de construction de 255 607,90 $, auxquels il a ajout\u00e9 100 000 $ pour tenir compte de la valeur du terrain (voir la pi\u00e8ce A-4, formulaire GST191-WS). Je note qu\u2019au paragraphe 14 de sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a expos\u00e9 des faits suppl\u00e9mentaires pour appuyer la cotisation, faits dont la charge de la preuve lui incombe (Canada c. Loewen, 2004 CAF 146, par. 10-11). Les alin\u00e9as 14a), b) et c) de la r\u00e9ponse sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s comme suit : [traduction]\n14. Le PGC expose en outre les faits suppl\u00e9mentaires suivants pour appuyer la cotisation faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel :\na) La juste valeur marchande du bien, une fois les r\u00e9novations achev\u00e9es, est au moins \u00e9gale \u00e0 450 000,00 $;\nb) L\u2019appelant a estim\u00e9 la juste valeur marchande de la remise \u00e0 355 607,90 $;\nc) La JVM estim\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur les co\u00fbts de construction et sur sa propre estimation de 100 000 $ pour la partie de son terrain d\u2019environ 30 pieds par 33 pieds que le garage occupait;\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste nulle part dans sa r\u00e9ponse le montant des co\u00fbts de construction de 255 607,90 $ sur lequel l\u2019appelant a fond\u00e9 le calcul du remboursement selon la feuille de travail partielle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve. Cette somme n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience. En r\u00e9ponse aux questions de la Cour sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 355 607,90 $, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas parler de la juste valeur marchande de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas \u00eatre mise sur le march\u00e9.\n[40] Je note que notre Cour a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de ne pas tenir compte des r\u00e8gles de preuve lorsqu\u2019un appel est entendu sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (voir Selmeci c. Canada, 2002 CAF 293; Suchon c. Canada, 2002 CAF 282). Je m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et notre Cour ont affirm\u00e9 que cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019aucune r\u00e8gle de preuve ne s\u2019applique et qu\u2019un juge est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019accepter tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[41] J\u2019aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 que la feuille de travail compl\u00e8te, indiquant la tabulation du montant des co\u00fbts de construction, soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Toutefois, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter la somme de 255 607,90 $ comme co\u00fbts de construction, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est indiqu\u00e9e sur la feuille de travail partielle (pi\u00e8ce A-4) et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a inclus cette hypoth\u00e8se de fait en combinant les paragraphes 14b) et c) dans la r\u00e9ponse sans soulever de r\u00e9serves \u00e0 ce sujet dans la r\u00e9ponse ou \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[42] En ce qui concerne l\u2019estimation de 100 000 $ pour le terrain contigu \u00e0 la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a fourni aucun d\u00e9tail sur la mani\u00e8re dont il est parvenu \u00e0 cette estimation, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019il a tenu compte de la taille du terrain que le garage occupe. Il a fait valoir que les \u00e9valuateurs auxquels il s\u2019\u00e9tait adress\u00e9 avaient sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que le terrain aurait une valeur nominale puisqu\u2019il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9 et am\u00e9nag\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019attribuer une valeur de 100 000 $ au terrain.\n[43] Je note que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e en 2016 pour 810 000 $. J\u2019ajouterai que dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019appelant \u00e9crit que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuation fonci\u00e8re municipale a \u00e9valu\u00e9 la valeur de l\u2019ensemble de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en 2023 \u00e0 755 000 $. Je comprends que de telles \u00e9valuations sont \u00e9galement imparfaites (voir, par exemple, Somers, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Toutefois, ces deux \u00e9valuations fournissent des renseignements importants pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du terrain par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 100 000 $. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 cette somme et n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune question \u00e0 ce sujet. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des renseignements ci-dessus, je conclus que la somme de 100 000 $ attribu\u00e9e au terrain est raisonnable.\n[44] Aussi imparfaite soit-elle, je conclus que, aux fins du calcul du remboursement, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9tabli que la valeur de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e et du terrain contigu est de 355 607,90 $.\n[45] Pour \u00eatre complet, et en raison du motif initial du ministre pour refuser le remboursement, je traiterai bri\u00e8vement l\u2019autre argument de l\u2019appelant, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il a fait des r\u00e9novations majeures au garage, de sorte que la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e est admissible \u00e0 titre d\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation ayant fait l\u2019objet de r\u00e9novations majeures. Je conclus que ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Pour r\u00e9nover, et a fortiori pour r\u00e9nover en profondeur, un immeuble d\u2019habitation, il faut d\u2019abord qu\u2019il y ait un immeuble d\u2019habitation. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition de ce terme dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. \u00c0 mon avis, le garage pr\u00e9existant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure, \u00e0 lui seul, d\u2019\u00eatre occup\u00e9 en tant que lieu de r\u00e9sidence; il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un immeuble d\u2019habitation. Si je devais consid\u00e9rer l\u2019ensemble du bien, y compris la maison principale, comme \u00e9tant l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au remboursement, je conclurais que l\u2019appelant ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab r\u00e9novations majeures \u00bb telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence (voir, par exemple, Whittall c. La Reine, 2017 CCI 212). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument subsidiaire de l\u2019appelant selon lequel, en construisant la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e, il a apport\u00e9 des r\u00e9novations majeures dans un immeuble d\u2019habitation, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 256(2)a), doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nVI. Conclusion\n[46] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que l\u2019appelant remplit les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 256(2) de la LTA, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la condition selon laquelle il doit avoir construit (ou engag\u00e9 une autre personne pour construire) un immeuble d\u2019habitation. Il a donc droit au remboursement pour habitations neuves calcul\u00e9 sur la base de ses co\u00fbts de construction de la maison d\u2019all\u00e9e et de la valeur du terrain contigu.\n[47] Bien que l\u2019appelant ait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande de d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, probablement parce qu\u2019il se sentait press\u00e9 par le temps, il a abord\u00e9 cette question dans ses observations \u00e9crites. L\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un avocat tr\u00e8s exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait consacr\u00e9 au moins 50 heures \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de son appel. Il estime qu\u2019il devrait avoir droit \u00e0 des d\u00e9pens de 870 $. L\u2019appelant a fait valoir que la Cour jouit d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour allouer les frais et d\u00e9pens dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel. Il a cit\u00e9 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions, que je trouve inapplicables pour diverses raisons, notamment parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019appels interjet\u00e9s en application d\u2019une autre l\u00e9gislation, comme la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ou en application de la proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ou d\u2019autres types d\u2019affaires port\u00e9es devant une cour diff\u00e9rente.\n[48] Mais surtout, \u00e0 l\u2019article 18.3009 de la Loi sur la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi de limiter la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour pour adjuger les frais et d\u00e9pens dans les recours en mati\u00e8re de TPS\/TVH sous le r\u00e9gime de la proc\u00e9dure informelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucuns frais et d\u00e9pens ne peuvent \u00eatre adjug\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelant dans le pr\u00e9sent appel (voir Canada c. DiFlorio, 2015 CAF 11, par. 9, Wang c. La Reine, 2021 CCI 86, par. 39).\n[49] L\u2019appel de la cotisation \u00e9tablie en application de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du remboursement pour habitations neuves est accueilli, sans d\u00e9pens, et la cotisation est renvoy\u00e9e au ministre du Revenu national pour nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 3e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Gabrielle St-Hilaire \u00bb\nLa juge St-Hilaire\nAnnexe A \u2013 D\u00e9finitions \u2013 Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.\nD\u00e9finition d\u2019un immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique au paragraphe 256(1).\nimmeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique Est assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logement unique :\na) l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logements multiples de deux habitations;\nb) tout autre immeuble d\u2019habitation \u00e0 logements multiples, s\u2019il est vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de la d\u00e9finition de immeuble d\u2019habitation au paragraphe 123(1) et contient une ou plusieurs habitations qui sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00eatre fournies comme chambres dans un h\u00f4tel, un motel, une auberge, une pension ou un g\u00eete semblable et qui ne seraient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie de l\u2019immeuble d\u2019habitation si celui-ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9 \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a.

Bacchus a d\u2019abord fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une cotisation pour ces ann\u00e9es, mais le ministre a par la suite \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 son \u00e9gard afin de refuser les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour don de bienfaisance demand\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 118.1(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. (1985), ch. 1 (5e suppl.) pour ce qui est de sa participation \u00e0 la Global Learning Gifting Initiative, \u00e9galement connue sous le nom de GLGI (le \u00ab programme GLGI \u00bb).\n[4] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 les montants suivants, en plus des reports des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes pour 2006, 2007, 2013 et 2014 :\n2005\n2006\n2009\n2012\nDon en esp\u00e8ces\n3 000 $\n3 000 $\n5 000 $\n5 000 $\nDon en nature\n15 000 $\n15 000 $\n25 000 $\n30 000 $\nTotal\n18 000 $\n18 000 $\n30 000 $\n35 000 $\n[5] L\u2019appelant a contest\u00e9 le rejet par le ministre de ses dons en esp\u00e8ces. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il a fait valoir que le processus par lequel les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies \u00e9tait injuste, car l\u2019ARC ne l\u2019a pas interrog\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer son intention lib\u00e9rale subjective et a injustement extrapol\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de l\u2019intention lib\u00e9rale subjective d\u2019autres participants au programme GLGI. Il a soutenu qu\u2019il y avait eu violation des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[6] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en radiation de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, soutenant que la conduite du ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas importante et que la question dont la Cour \u00e9tait saisie \u00e9tait celle de l\u2019exactitude des nouvelles cotisations.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties, la Cour a radi\u00e9 les paragraphes en cause sans radier l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, indiquant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 entendre la preuve et les arguments de l\u2019appelant sur la question de son intention lib\u00e9rale relative au don en esp\u00e8ces.\n[8] Comme l\u2019appelant l\u2019a lui-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9, la question \u00e0 trancher dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est celle de savoir s\u2019il a droit aux cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour don de bienfaisance pour les dons en esp\u00e8ces, comme ils sont d\u00e9crits ci-dessus.\n[9] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, le ministre a formul\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses factuelles que je r\u00e9sumerais comme suit :\na)Le programme GLGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur pied \u00e0 titre d\u2019abri fiscal qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu en fonction du fait que les participants auraient droit \u00e0 des cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019environ 56 % \u00e0 112 % de leur don en esp\u00e8ces.\nb)Les participants avaient le droit de devenir des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de capital d\u2019une fiducie et, \u00e0 leur acceptation, ils auraient le droit de recevoir des didacticiels \u00e9ducatifs qui seraient ensuite donn\u00e9s aux organismes de bienfaisance.\nc)Les participants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 automatiquement approuv\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de capital, mais n\u2019ont pas pris possession du didacticiel. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, les didacticiels n\u2019avaient aucune valeur.\nd)Les participants ont obtenu des re\u00e7us aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur lesquels \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e la valeur du don en esp\u00e8ces et la valeur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e du didacticiel. Comme le didacticiel n\u2019avait aucune valeur pour le don en nature, il s\u2019agissait en fait d\u2019un re\u00e7u gonfl\u00e9 aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t.\n[10] Le ministre a adopt\u00e9 la position selon laquelle les participants au programme GLGI n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019intention lib\u00e9rale parce qu\u2019ils ont fait des dons en esp\u00e8ces pour obtenir des cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t qui d\u00e9passaient la valeur de leurs dons en esp\u00e8ces. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils avaient r\u00e9ellement l\u2019intention de tirer un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de leur don en esp\u00e8ces. En fin de compte, tous les participants se sont fi\u00e9s \u00e0 des re\u00e7us officiels de dons gonfl\u00e9s puisque le didacticiel n\u2019avait aucune valeur.\nI. La preuve\n[11] L\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour son propre compte. Aucun autre t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9.\n[12] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en cause, il travaillait de fa\u00e7on autonome comme avocat. M\u00eame s\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des dons de bienfaisance de 25 $ \u00e0 100 $, il avait \u00e9galement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 diverses activit\u00e9s de bienfaisance et donn\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et d\u2019\u00e9nergie, ou ce qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 [traduction] une \u00ab contribution en nature \u00bb.\n[13] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9 au programme GLGI par son agent d\u2019assurance qu\u2019il connaissait et qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme un ami. Il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 son bureau o\u00f9 il a rencontr\u00e9 un promoteur qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 le programme GLGI et lui a fourni certains documents qu\u2019il a apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison pour les examiner avec son \u00e9pouse.\n[14] Au d\u00e9part, il \u00e9tait sceptique, mais il a fait preuve de diligence raisonnable et effectu\u00e9 une recherche en ligne pour d\u00e9terminer si les organismes de bienfaisance et les d\u00e9positaires l\u00e9gaux \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes. Il a conclu qu\u2019ils l\u2019\u00e9taient. Il comprenait que s\u2019il faisait un don en esp\u00e8ces, il aurait droit \u00e0 un didacticiel de grande valeur. En tant qu\u2019homme d\u2019affaires cherchant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son sort et celui de sa famille, il a envisag\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont il pourrait profiter de cette occasion. Il a par la suite conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucun droit contractuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du didacticiel et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de simplement le donner aux organismes de bienfaisance.\n[15] L\u2019appelant a produit une s\u00e9rie de re\u00e7us \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses dons en esp\u00e8ces et a soutenu qu\u2019il devrait avoir droit \u00e0 des cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour don de bienfaisance pour ces montants parce que, subjectivement, il avait une intention lib\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019il a fait les dons. Il a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas sciemment particip\u00e9 au programme GLGI et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab escroqu\u00e9 \u00bb par son agent d\u2019assurance.\n[16] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Bacchus a reconnu qu\u2019il avait \u00e9tudi\u00e9 dans un programme de comptabilit\u00e9 de deux ans et qu\u2019il avait par la suite obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en droit. Il a admis que GLGI lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme une fa\u00e7on de faire des dons \u00e0 des organismes de bienfaisance et d\u2019obtenir \u00e9ventuellement un avantage. Il comprenait que GLGI constituait un abri fiscal, qu\u2019il obtiendrait un all\u00e8gement fiscal et \u00e9conomiserait de l\u2019argent, et il a admis qu\u2019il cherchait un avantage. Il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019une brochure d\u2019information ou d\u2019une suggestion d\u2019avantage en mati\u00e8re de liquidit\u00e9s.\nII. Analyse\n[17] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, la Cour conclut que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que les hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre \u00e9taient incorrectes.\n[18] En particulier, la Cour estime que l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u les brochures d\u2019information d\u00e9crivant le programme GLGI qu\u2019il a ensuite examin\u00e9es avec son \u00e9pouse. Compte tenu de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en droit et en comptabilit\u00e9, la Cour conclut qu\u2019il comprenait qu\u2019il y aurait un avantage en mati\u00e8re de liquidit\u00e9s en ce sens que la valeur du didacticiel d\u00e9passerait le montant de son don en argent selon un ratio de 5 pour 1.\n[19] La Cour estime que l\u2019appelant comprenait que sa participation lui permettrait de recevoir des remboursements d\u2019imp\u00f4t sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la valeur de son don en esp\u00e8ces. M\u00eame si la Cour accepte qu\u2019il f\u00fbt initialement sceptique, ces pr\u00e9occupations se sont rapidement dissip\u00e9es, car il a accept\u00e9 de participer au programme GLGI pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n[20] La Cour note que chaque ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il a particip\u00e9, il a sign\u00e9 plusieurs documents, dont la demande d\u2019approbation \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de capital de la fiducie, l\u2019acte de donation du montant en esp\u00e8ces ainsi que l\u2019acte de donation du bien donn\u00e9. Dans ce dernier document, il d\u00e9clarait [traduction] \u00ab \u00eatre le seul et unique propri\u00e9taire en common law et propri\u00e9taire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire en possession et en contr\u00f4le du logiciel \u00e9ducatif \u00bb et souhaitait [traduction] \u00ab en faire don de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9vocable, absolue et inconditionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019organisme de bienfaisance \u00bb.\n[21] L\u2019appelant a choisi de croire que le didacticiel avait une valeur fond\u00e9e sur les \u00e9valuations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es. Malheureusement, cela s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 faux et la juste valeur marchande r\u00e9elle \u00e9tait au mieux nominale. Aucune preuve du contraire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e.\n[22] Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9, l\u2019appelant affirme que, subjectivement, il avait l\u2019intention lib\u00e9rale n\u00e9cessaire lorsqu\u2019il a fait les dons en esp\u00e8ces.\n[23] Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le juge Iacobucci dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Symes c. La Reine [1993] 4 R.C.S. 695 (par. 74) \u2013 et je cite \u2013 lorsqu\u2019il faut \u00e9tablir \u00ab l\u2019objet ou l\u2019intention des actes, on ne doit pas supposer que les tribunaux se fonderont seulement, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cette question, sur les d\u00e9clarations du contribuable, ex post facto ou autrement, quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet subjectif d\u2019une d\u00e9pense donn\u00e9e. Ils examineront plut\u00f4t comment l\u2019objet se manifeste objectivement, et l\u2019objet est en d\u00e9finitive une question de fait \u00e0 trancher en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances \u00bb.\n[24] En examinant la manifestation objective de l\u2019objectif en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour conclut que l\u2019appelant voulait faire les dons en esp\u00e8ces parce qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 avoir droit \u00e0 des didacticiels d\u2019une valeur \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 cinq fois son don en esp\u00e8ces. En fin de compte, il a choisi de mettre ses doutes de c\u00f4t\u00e9 parce que le don all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du didacticiel aux organismes de bienfaisance lui permettrait d\u2019obtenir un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la valeur du don en argent.\n[25] Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ne d\u00e9finit pas le terme \u00ab don \u00bb, mais le terme a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans la jurisprudence comme \u00e9tant un transfert de biens \u00e0 titre gratuit qui n\u2019est pas effectu\u00e9 en contrepartie d\u2019un avantage ou d\u2019un profit financier. L\u2019appauvrissement de la part d\u2019un donataire reconnu constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel d\u2019un don. Si l\u2019un de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments est absent, l\u2019intention lib\u00e9rale sera vici\u00e9e.\n[26] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019appelant a manifestement pay\u00e9 de ses poches les dons en esp\u00e8ces, la Cour conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de s\u2019appauvrir parce que le programme GLGI \u00e9tait con\u00e7u pour lui permettre d\u2019obtenir des cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t sup\u00e9rieurs au montant de son don en esp\u00e8ces.\n[27] La description du programme GLGI laisse peu de doutes quant au fait que l\u2019appelant, ainsi que des milliers d\u2019autres Canadiens, ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un arrangement comportant une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9tapes pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et interreli\u00e9es. En acceptant de participer et en faisant le don initial en esp\u00e8ces, ils avaient automatiquement le droit de recevoir un didacticiel qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq fois la valeur de la d\u00e9pense. Cela pose probl\u00e8me, car la d\u00e9finition \u00e9tablie de \u00ab don \u00bb suppose que le donateur n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u d\u2019avantage financier ou autre.\n[28] Dans la d\u00e9cision Mariano c. La Reine, 2015 CCI 244 (\u00ab Mariano \u00bb), la Cour a entendu des t\u00e9moignages et a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen approfondi du programme GLGI. Elle a conclu que les dons all\u00e9gu\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s en raison de l\u2019avantage financier re\u00e7u par les participants. Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que le didacticiel n\u2019avait aucune valeur marchande. Notre Cour est li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision Mariano en fonction des principes de courtoisie judiciaire, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans R. c. Sullivan, 2022 CSC 19 (par. 24).\n[29] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de distinction entre sa situation personnelle et celle des contribuables dans l\u2019affaire Mariano, mais il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il devrait avoir le droit de r\u00e9clamer son don en esp\u00e8ces.\n[30] Toutefois, dans les d\u00e9cisions Mar\u00e9chaux c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 587, Kossow c. La Reine, 2012 CCI 325 et Markou c. La Reine, 2018 CCI 66, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de fractionner les dons faits dans le cadre d\u2019un arrangement comportant une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9tapes pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et interd\u00e9pendantes. Ces d\u00e9cisions appuient la proposition selon laquelle il n\u2019est pas possible de consid\u00e9rer les dons en esp\u00e8ces isol\u00e9ment.\n[31] Cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mar\u00e9chaux c. Canada, 2010 CAF 287 (par. 12), elle a souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance selon laquelle, s\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul arrangement interd\u00e9pendant, aucune partie de celui-ci ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un don.\n[32] De m\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Makou c. Canada, 2019 CAF 299 (par. 60), elle a conclu que \u00ab la personne qui pr\u00e9voit recevoir des avantages fiscaux sup\u00e9rieurs au montant ou \u00e0 la valeur d\u2019un pr\u00e9tendu don n\u2019a forc\u00e9ment pas d\u2019intention lib\u00e9rale. L\u2019appauvrissement \u00e9tant un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du don en droit civil et en common law, le pr\u00e9tendu don constitu\u00e9 par la contribution en esp\u00e8ces ne saurait \u00eatre reconnu en tant que don \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9galement. Les arguments de l\u2019appelant sont ainsi \u00e9cart\u00e9s.\nIII. Conclusion\n[33] La Cour ajoute qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas un tribunal d\u2019equity et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce titre, elle ne peut rendre de d\u00e9cisions fond\u00e9es sur des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou de justice.\n[34] Elle n\u2019a pas non plus comp\u00e9tence pour renoncer aux int\u00e9r\u00eats ou aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019ils sont impos\u00e9s correctement. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats se sont accumul\u00e9s sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant a le droit de demander un all\u00e8gement en vertu du Programme des all\u00e8gements pour les contribuables g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada et, au besoin, de demander un contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions du ministre devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[35] L\u2019appel est donc rejet\u00e9. Aucuns d\u00e9pens ne seront adjug\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa (Ontario), ce 8\u1d49 jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Guy R.

Le pr\u00e9sent appel a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une audience d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de deux jours, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Mme Caron a agi pour son propre compte.\n[2] Le pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur cinq questions :\nLe refus par l\u2019ARC d\u2019une d\u00e9duction pour int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u2019environ 154 000 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en 2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un emprunt aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un certain M. Trudeau.\nLe refus par l\u2019ARC d\u2019une perte autre qu\u2019en capital tenant \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pour frais d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en 2013 et du report r\u00e9trospectif \u00e0 2012 de cette perte autre qu\u2019en capital d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en 2013, dans les deux cas au motif que l\u2019ARC avait refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction pour int\u00e9r\u00eats;\nL\u2019augmentation d\u2019environ 39 000 $ par l\u2019ARC du montant des gains en capital imposables tir\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante de la vente de deux de ses immeubles locatifs \u00e0 Longueuil en 2013;\nLa d\u00e9duction par Mme Caron de 25 000 $ \u00e0 30 000 $ de d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es en 2005 et 2006 dans le calcul de ses revenus locatifs en 2013. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, Mme Caron demande l\u2019ajout de ces sommes au PBR des immeubles.\nL\u2019imposition par l\u2019ARC d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour production tardive de la d\u00e9claration pour 2013 de pr\u00e8s de 2 000 $.\nI. Les t\u00e9moins [3] En plus de t\u00e9moigner elle-m\u00eame, Mme Caron a fait bri\u00e8vement compara\u00eetre son fr\u00e8re concernant certains aspects du financement qu\u2019elle a obtenu de M. Trudeau. La v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARC a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[4] Je n\u2019ai aucune pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 de chacun de ces t\u00e9moins.\n[5] Je n\u2019ai aucune pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du fr\u00e8re de Mme Caron. Il a volontiers d\u00e9crit le r\u00f4le limit\u00e9 qu\u2019il a jou\u00e9 dans des \u00e9v\u00e9nements remontant \u00e0 plus de dix ans et l\u2019observation limit\u00e9e qu\u2019il en a faite, et expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait uniquement relater ce dont il se souvenait. Ce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour correspond \u00e0 ce qui figure dans la copie non sign\u00e9e de son affidavit r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 2013 par l\u2019avocat de sa s\u0153ur concernant une requ\u00eate d\u2019urgence en injonction contre M. Trudeau et ses relations financi\u00e8res avec l\u2019appelante.\n[6] Je n\u2019ai aucune pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de la v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARC. Son rapport \u00e9crit, ainsi que les documents justificatifs disponibles, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[7] Je retiens que Mme Caron est un t\u00e9moin honn\u00eate et qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve direct ne permet de penser qu\u2019elle a intentionnellement tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9duire des sommes qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en droit de d\u00e9duire ou avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9duites. Toutefois, j\u2019ai des doutes sur la fiabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage compte tenu des affirmations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales faites concernant ce qu\u2019elle savait, croyait, comprenait ou se rappelait, dans leur ensemble, et du fait que certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments clefs \u00e9taient incompatibles avec des documents sign\u00e9s \u2013 et dans certains cas \u00e9crits \u2013 par elle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable du fait que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas cit\u00e9 M. Trudeau \u00e0 compara\u00eetre comme t\u00e9moin pour confirmer sa version des faits. Je m\u2019y refuse. L\u2019ARC aurait pu communiquer avec M. Trudeau dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification. Comme l\u2019appelante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu assigner M. Trudeau \u00e0 compara\u00eetre s\u2019il souhaitait le faire entendre. Aucune raison n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pour expliquer pourquoi cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Vu les all\u00e9gations que Mme Caron a formul\u00e9es contre M. Trudeau dans son instance civile en Cour du Qu\u00e9bec et dans le pr\u00e9sent appel fiscal, nous pouvons ais\u00e9ment tenir pour acquis que la version de Mme Caron et celle de M. Trudeau s\u2019opposeraient. Il serait fort surprenant qu\u2019il en soit autrement. Ce n\u2019est pas un motif valable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Caron.\nII. Analyse\nLe refus de la d\u00e9duction pour paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour, je ne suis pas en mesure de conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019une somme de 154 000 $ correspondant aux int\u00e9r\u00eats en question est une d\u00e9duction permise.\n[10] Je ne suis pas en mesure de conclure que ces sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es \u00e0 titre d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ou \u00e0 un autre co\u00fbt du financement fourni par M. Trudeau. On ne retrouve pas, dans les documents \u00e9tablis concernant chaque avance, les sommes dont M. Trudeau a exig\u00e9 le paiement par Mme Caron, selon cette derni\u00e8re, au moment o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u chaque avance. On ne les retrouve pas dans le document de r\u00e8glement et de quittance que Mme Caron a sign\u00e9, apr\u00e8s que son avocat l\u2019a r\u00e9vis\u00e9. Selon ce document, aucune portion des 340 000 $ vers\u00e9s lors de l\u2019entente n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ue \u00e0 titre d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. Cette somme \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure au montant du capital emprunt\u00e9 par Mme Caron. Le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment que le fr\u00e8re de Mme Caron a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de confirmer est qu\u2019il avait vu sa s\u0153ur se rendre \u00e0 la banque avec M. Trudeau et remettre \u00e0 ce dernier une somme en esp\u00e8ces, que M. Trudeau a compt\u00e9e. Il ne connaissait ni les raisons, ni les montants, ni aucun autre d\u00e9tail de ces transactions.\n[11] Pour les m\u00eames motifs, je ne suis pas en mesure de conclure que ces sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation juridique de payer des int\u00e9r\u00eats, car elles sont clairement sup\u00e9rieures au taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat figurant dans les documents de financement.\n[12] Je ne peux pas non plus conclure que Mme Caron a utilis\u00e9 la somme de pr\u00e8s de 400 000 $ emprunt\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins ouvrant droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9duction pour int\u00e9r\u00eats. La somme emprunt\u00e9e n\u2019a servi ni \u00e0 l\u2019achat des immeubles locatifs, ni \u00e0 des am\u00e9liorations en capital apport\u00e9es aux immobilisations, ni \u00e0 des ajouts aux immobilisations. Ni les travaux d\u2019entretien et de r\u00e9paration document\u00e9s, ni ceux d\u00e9crits par Mme Caron dans son t\u00e9moignage oral, n\u2019ont eu un co\u00fbt total approchant la somme emprunt\u00e9e. Il n\u2019est pas certain que toutes les unit\u00e9s des immeubles locatifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raient un loyer selon le march\u00e9. L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa m\u00e8re occupait l\u2019une des unit\u00e9s, moyennant un loyer modeste, et il n\u2019est pas clairement \u00e9tabli que l\u2019appelante et son fr\u00e8re n\u2019occupaient pas \u00e9galement une unit\u00e9 de ces immeubles.\n[13] Mme Caron a \u00e9t\u00e9 avare de d\u00e9tails et s\u2019est content\u00e9e de faire des d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9parer et de r\u00e9nover sans cesse ses diff\u00e9rents immeubles locatifs. Il n\u2019existe aucun document comptable ou bancaire \u00e9tayant la description des sommes avanc\u00e9es par M. Trudeau et vers\u00e9es \u00e0 ce dernier, ni m\u00eame aucun document compatible avec cette description.\n[14] Je retiens que Mme Caron all\u00e8gue que M. Trudeau a profit\u00e9 d\u2019elle, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re que l\u2019on pourrait d\u00e9crire d\u2019arnaque ou d\u2019escroquerie financi\u00e8re. Toutefois, les pertes financi\u00e8res subies aux mains de fraudeurs et d\u2019escrocs ne sont pas une perte d\u00e9ductible aux fins du calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Je ne suis pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien suffisant entre le financement qu\u2019elle a obtenu de M. Trudeau et ses activit\u00e9s locatives, donc ses pertes et les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s au financement obtenu de M. Trudeau ne sont pas d\u00e9ductibles.\nLe report r\u00e9trospectif des pertes\n[15] Le report r\u00e9trospectif des pertes locatives de 2013 \u00e0 2012 tenait \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction demand\u00e9e par Mme Caron des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s au financement obtenu de M. Trudeau en 2013, que j\u2019ai analys\u00e9e ci-dessus. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019ARC avait refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction pour 2013 \u00e0 bon droit, il n\u2019existe aucune perte en 2013 susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9trospectivement report\u00e9e \u00e0 2012. L\u2019appel sur ce point est rejet\u00e9.\nLes gains en capital imposables sur les immeubles St-Alexandre et Montcalm\n[16] La Cour ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve fiable \u00e9tablissant que les montants additionnels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9s sont erron\u00e9s. Les co\u00fbts initiaux et les prix de vente des deux immeubles ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et figurent dans les documents d\u2019achat et de vente. Le prix de base rajust\u00e9 (le \u00ab PBR \u00bb) figurant dans le rapport de v\u00e9rification a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli sur la base des documents et des d\u00e9clarations de la contribuable elle-m\u00eame.\n[17] Mme Caron reproche \u00e0 l\u2019ARC d\u2019indiquer dans les nouvelles cotisations des gains en capital nettement sup\u00e9rieurs aux sommes nettes qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ues de la vente des immeubles concern\u00e9s. Elle semble ne pas avoir tenu compte du fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9galement vers\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Trudeau les 340 000 $ convenus \u00e0 m\u00eame le produit de ces ventes, puisqu\u2019il \u00e9tait titulaire d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que sur les immeubles de l\u2019appelante en garantie de son pr\u00eat, en sus des hypoth\u00e8ques pr\u00e9existantes de la banque sur ces immeubles.\n[18] L\u2019appel sur ce point est \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9.\nLe refus des factures pour l\u2019entretien et les r\u00e9parations\n[19] Ces factures datent toutes de 2005 et de 2006, et non des ann\u00e9es 2012 ou 2013 en question. Il n\u2019existe aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve fiable \u00e9tablissant que ces d\u00e9penses n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duites au titre de frais d\u2019entretien et de r\u00e9paration lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es, ce qui \u00e9tait la pratique standard stricte de Mme Caron selon les explications claires et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de cette derni\u00e8re. Ces factures et d\u00e9penses n\u2019ont manifestement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9gar\u00e9es, n\u00e9glig\u00e9es ou oubli\u00e9es au cours des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Les d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien et de r\u00e9paration sont correctement d\u00e9duites au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es, et non au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e bien ult\u00e9rieure. Pour les m\u00eames motifs, ces sommes ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme du capital et ajout\u00e9es au PBR des immeubles locatifs. L\u2019appel sur ce point est rejet\u00e9.\nLa p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour production tardive\n[20] Mme Caron ne nie pas avoir produit sa d\u00e9claration pour 2013 tardivement. La p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour production tardive pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 150 est stricte et le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu de moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur la diligence raisonnable \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la juge Wood, maintenant juge \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans la d\u00e9cision Douglas c. La Reine, 2012 CCI 73, au par. 14, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas un contribuable d\u2019invoquer la diligence raisonnable s\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures raisonnables pour se conformer \u00e0 la loi (Voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Home Depot of Canada Inc. c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 281, rendue par le juge Miller, cit\u00e9e par la juge Woods. Voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Moore c. La Reine, 2019 CCI 141, aux par. 18 \u00e0 21).\n[21] La situation et les explications de Mme Caron ne me permettent pas de conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que celle-ci a pris toutes les mesures raisonnables pour produire sa d\u00e9claration pour 2013 dans les d\u00e9lais impartis. L\u2019appel sur la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour production tardive est rejet\u00e9.\nIII. Conclusion [22] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacun des moyens invoqu\u00e9s par Mme Caron.\n[23] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 les d\u00e9pens selon le tarif figurant dans les R\u00e8gles de notre Cour.\n[24] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens fix\u00e9s selon le tarif.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, Ontario, ce 14e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nJuge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024CCI68\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2017-3312(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nJOHANNE CARON c.

Pr\u00e9cis [1] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, notre Cour est saisie des appels interjet\u00e9s par Steve Paquet et sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 4527976 Canada Inc. (\u00ab H\u00e9ritage \u00bb), faisant affaire sous le nom de \u00ab H\u00e9ritage \u00bb et, auparavant, sous le nom de \u00ab Les Volailles H\u00e9ritage \u00bb. Ces appels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cotisations d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 2010 \u00e0 2013 en ce qui concerne M. Paquet et pour les ann\u00e9es 2010 \u00e0 2014 en ce qui concerne H\u00e9ritage. La majorit\u00e9 des cotisations a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Les sommes incluses dans le revenu sont une s\u00e9rie d\u2019importantes sommes en esp\u00e8ces que Garda a livr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019adresse commerciale d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. Garda obtenait les esp\u00e8ces en caisse \u00e0 livrer aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 non li\u00e9e aux appelants et les enveloppes de livraison de Garda \u00e9taient adress\u00e9es \u00e0 cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. Les sommes, qui allaient de 15 000 $ \u00e0 150 000 $, \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es chaque semaine, parfois plusieurs fois par semaine. Pour les ann\u00e9es en cause, la somme totale d\u00e9passait 20 000 000 $. L\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (\u00ab ARC \u00bb) a inclus toutes ces sommes dans le revenu des deux appelants, ce qui est autoris\u00e9, mais qui laisse une comptabilisation en double des revenus qui s\u2019av\u00e8re presque toujours incompatible et, au bout du compte, incorrecte[1]. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019exercice financier des deux appelants ne se termine pas en m\u00eame temps, des totaux diff\u00e9rents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans leurs revenus[2]. Des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour faute lourde ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es aux deux appelants relativement aux sommes ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une cotisation.\n[2] Des proc\u00e9dures p\u00e9nales quelque peu parall\u00e8les sont en cours devant la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec quant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle responsabilit\u00e9 de M. Paquet et d\u2019H\u00e9ritage dans la d\u00e9signation erron\u00e9e d\u2019op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res dans des documents financiers cr\u00e9\u00e9s par eux. Les questions en litige devant la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec ne sont pas de nature fiscale et sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes, mais elles portent en grande partie sur les m\u00eames faits. Je ne fais pas montre de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conclusions de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec en premi\u00e8re instance, puisque ces conclusions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 concr\u00e8tement neutralis\u00e9es en appel par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de nouveau proc\u00e8s et qu\u2019il pourrait ne jamais y en avoir. Je n\u2019ai pas non plus accord\u00e9 d\u2019importance aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec puisqu\u2019aucun t\u00e9moignage ou \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ant\u00e9rieur pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 devant les t\u00e9moins dans le pr\u00e9sent appel ni autrement produit en preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Les parties pouvaient, si elles le souhaitaient, convoquer dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure n\u2019importe lequel des t\u00e9moins entendus par la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[3] Les appelants menaient des activit\u00e9s de vente de volaille en gros. Les revenus bruts d\u2019H\u00e9ritage \u00e9taient de l\u2019ordre de 20 millions de dollars. L\u2019Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec (\u00ab ARQ \u00bb) a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 les appelants, ainsi que d\u2019autres interm\u00e9diaires, comme parties \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019op\u00e9rations sur le march\u00e9 de la volaille dans le cadre desquelles d\u2019importantes sommes en esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es par Garda \u00e0 l\u2019adresse commerciale d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. L\u2019ARQ a diligent\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois une enqu\u00eate et une v\u00e9rification, et l\u2019ARC a fait intervenir son \u00e9quipe de v\u00e9rification et son \u00e9quipe de recouvrement. Des t\u00e9moins des deux agences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus.\n[4] La v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ARQ a abouti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux appelants. L\u2019ARQ a communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ARC les r\u00e9sultats de son enqu\u00eate et de sa v\u00e9rification, ainsi que les cotisations \u00e9tablies. L\u2019ARC a \u00e9tabli, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Paquet, de nouvelles cotisations qualifi\u00e9es de cotisations miroirs aux cotisations de l\u2019ARQ. On entendait par l\u00e0 que l\u2019ARC avait inclus la m\u00eame somme que l\u2019ARQ dans le revenu, sans effectuer de r\u00e9elle v\u00e9rification ind\u00e9pendante. L\u2019ARC a \u00e9tabli une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019H\u00e9ritage sur une base enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente qui incluait simplement dans le revenu d\u2019H\u00e9ritage le montant total d\u2019esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9 \u00e0 ses locaux par Garda, sans autre v\u00e9rification, rajustement ni allocation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun motif raisonnable et logique expliquant pourquoi les deux appelants ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une analyse et d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation sur des bases aussi diff\u00e9rentes.\n[5] Les t\u00e9moins des appelants \u00e9taient M. Paquet, Maria D\u2019Amico (la r\u00e9ceptionniste qui signait habituellement lors des livraisons effectu\u00e9es par Garda si M. Monette \u00e9tait absent, et qui gardait le paquet dans son bureau jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que M. Monette le r\u00e9cup\u00e8re), Nathalie Paquet (adjointe administrative chez H\u00e9ritage et s\u0153ur de M. Paquet), Daniel Dauplaise (vice-pr\u00e9sident des op\u00e9rations de Garda au Qu\u00e9bec) et Rima Skaf (v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARQ).\n[6] Les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient David Sawyer (agent de recouvrement de l\u2019ARC), Genevi\u00e8ve Robillard (v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARC et d\u00e9sormais cheffe d\u2019\u00e9quipe) et Minyu Chiu (enqu\u00eatrice de l\u2019ARQ).\n[7] Pour les motifs qui suivent, les appels seront accueillis int\u00e9gralement puisque la Cour n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fiables, cr\u00e9dibles et coh\u00e9rents, directs ou indirects, corrobor\u00e9s ou non, pour conclure que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve permettait d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9es par Garda appartenaient \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des appelants, ou que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre s\u2019\u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 cet argent, ou encore que l\u2019argent avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 leur profit. La Cour n\u2019est pas en mesure de conclure, selon cette norme, que les sommes en cause devraient \u00eatre incluses dans le revenu de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des appelants. Dans ces conditions, l\u2019ARC n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir de cotisations pour des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation et, pour les ann\u00e9es qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas frapp\u00e9es de prescription, l\u2019ARC doit \u00e9tablir des nouvelles cotisations afin d\u2019exclure les sommes incluses dans le revenu et de supprimer les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour faute lourde.\n[8] Il ne faut absolument pas en d\u00e9duire que la Cour conclut que cette s\u00e9rie de livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces par Garda, ainsi que les commandes, les livraisons et les obligations circul\u00e9es, correspond \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des v\u00e9ritables op\u00e9rations sous-jacentes qui ont eu lieu entre les diff\u00e9rents participants. Il semble au contraire qu\u2019un ou plusieurs participants se soient livr\u00e9s \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s douteuses. La Cour n\u2019a tout simplement pas re\u00e7u assez d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour conclure que les op\u00e9rations ont eu lieu au profit des appelants. L\u2019ARQ et l\u2019ARC semblaient toutes deux avoir des soup\u00e7ons \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue raisonnables quant aux activit\u00e9s des appelants, ce qui les a incit\u00e9es \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des enqu\u00eates et \u00e0 des v\u00e9rifications. Malheureusement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a laiss\u00e9 subsister des soup\u00e7ons semblables dans l\u2019esprit de la Cour, ce qui est loin de prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de l\u2019inclusion des sommes dans le revenu de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des appelants selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. La Cour ne peut confirmer les soup\u00e7ons de l\u2019ARQ et de l\u2019ARC portant que les sommes en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues par l\u2019un des appelants ou les deux et au profit de l\u2019un ou des deux. La Cour conclut simplement qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que ces soup\u00e7ons \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s.\nII. Charge de la preuve\n[9] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 subsiste une approche suppl\u00e9tive \u00e0 la loi relativement \u00e0 la charge de la preuve qui incombe aux parties et qui encadre l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve et la prise de d\u00e9cision par notre Cour, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hickman Motors Ltd. c. Canada [1997] 2 RCS 336, je conclus que les appelants se sont parfaitement acquitt\u00e9s de toute charge initiale qui leur incombait.\n[10] Le juge Dussault, dans la d\u00e9cision Brasserie Futuriste de Laval Inc. c. La Reine 2006 CCI 503, aux paragraphes 159 et 160, fait remarquer que l\u2019id\u00e9e de d\u00e9molir des pr\u00e9somptions avec au moins une preuve prima facie, expos\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hickman Motors, va express\u00e9ment dans le sens de la d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure de notre Cour dans la d\u00e9cision Kamin c. M.R.N., 93 DTC 62 :\n[160] Au paragraphe 96 de la d\u00e9cision, la juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 reprenait \u00e0 son compte l\u2019observation suivante du juge Brul\u00e9 de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans l\u2019affaire Kamin c. M.R.N., 93 DTC 62, \u00e0 la page 64 :\nLe Ministre n\u2019a pas carte blanche pour \u00e9tablir les pr\u00e9somptions qui lui conviennent. \u00c0 l\u2019interrogatoire principal, on s\u2019attend qu\u2019il puisse produire des preuves plus concr\u00e8tes que de simples pr\u00e9somptions pour r\u00e9futer les arguments de l\u2019appelant.\n[Soulign\u00e9 dans le texte.]\n[11] Le juge Hogan, dans la d\u00e9cision Cantore c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 367, au paragraphe 18, appliquant le principe de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hickman Motors, a not\u00e9 que lorsque la v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARC prend un raccourci grossier, par exemple en n\u2019analysant pas tous les comptes bancaires de l\u2019appelant, et qu\u2019aucun motif satisfaisant n\u2019est donn\u00e9 ou ne ressort du dossier, cela influe forc\u00e9ment sur le type de preuve que l\u2019appelant devra produite pour s\u2019acquitter de sa charge initiale.\n[12] J\u2019ai tenu compte des commentaires formul\u00e9s par ces deux juges dans mon examen de l\u2019arr\u00eat Hickman Motors en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et dans ma conclusion selon laquelle les appelants se sont acquitt\u00e9s de toute charge initiale qui leur incombait.\nIII. Faits et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve\n[13] L\u2019ARQ a diligent\u00e9 des v\u00e9rifications de Termont Inc. (\u00ab Termont \u00bb), de son unique actionnaire Laurent Monette, ainsi que d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et de M. Paquet. Termont n\u2019avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aucun revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 2010 \u00e0 2012. Elle n\u2019avait pas tenu de comptabilit\u00e9 ni conserv\u00e9 de pi\u00e8ces justificatives. L\u2019ARQ a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse des dossiers bancaires et c\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle a constat\u00e9 que Termont d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait des esp\u00e8ces en passant par Garda[3].\n[14] Toutes les sommes en cause \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es en esp\u00e8ces par Garda \u00e0 une adresse commerciale d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, l\u2019envoi \u00e9tant adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Termont. Garda obtenait les directives de livraison et les formulaires d\u2019autorisation aupr\u00e8s de Termont. L\u2019argent \u00e9tait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Garda \u00e0 partir d\u2019un compte bancaire de Termont. On communiquait ensuite avec M. Monette qui venait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer l\u2019enveloppe cachet\u00e9e. Rien ne prouve que les esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient remises directement ou indirectement \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des appelants.\n[15] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ont pas permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement ce qu\u2019il advenait ensuite des esp\u00e8ces. Les enqu\u00eates et les v\u00e9rifications men\u00e9es par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales n\u2019ont pas permis de savoir ce que devenaient les esp\u00e8ces apr\u00e8s la livraison par Garda. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 si ces esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient ou non retir\u00e9es de ces arrangements pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins. Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que le m\u00eame argent a circul\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 des fins ou pour des raisons qui demeurent inconnues.\n[16] M. Monette a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Paquet s\u2019il pouvait utiliser l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage pour les livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces de Termont effectu\u00e9es par Garda \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re exigeait un lieu d\u2019affaires dont elle \u00e9tait convaincue qu\u2019il \u00e9tait s\u00e9curitaire pour toutes les personnes concern\u00e9es. Garda refusait d\u2019effectuer des livraisons \u00e0 une r\u00e9sidence. Garda a mis fin \u00e0 son contrat avec M. Monette et Termont lorsqu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute, un jour o\u00f9 M. Monette n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent pour une livraison, la consigne de laisser une enveloppe remplie d\u2019esp\u00e8ces sur le coffre d\u2019une voiture dans le stationnement plut\u00f4t que de la livrer \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u00e9difice comme cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu et convenu en tant que m\u00e9thode s\u00e9curitaire acceptable approuv\u00e9e par Garda pour Termont. La Cour n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant qui avait donn\u00e9 ces directives contraires, \u00e0 qui appartenait le v\u00e9hicule, ni qui devait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer l\u2019argent dans le v\u00e9hicule.\n[17] M. Monette est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avant l\u2019audition du pr\u00e9sent appel. La d\u00e9claration sous serment qu\u2019il a faite en 2015 et remise aux autorit\u00e9s fiscales a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Dans cette d\u00e9claration, il reconnaissait qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 tout l\u2019argent livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, que tout l\u2019argent que Termont avait livr\u00e9 en passant par Garda appartenait bien \u00e0 Termont et qu\u2019il n\u2019appartenait ni \u00e0 M. Paquet ni \u00e0 H\u00e9ritage. Je ne peux pas conclure que la preuve r\u00e9futent les d\u00e9clarations sous serment de M. Monette. Il peut tr\u00e8s bien avoir gard\u00e9 les esp\u00e8ces et les avoir utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 des fins personnelles ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, la source des revenus de M. Monette ainsi que certaines de ses activit\u00e9s \u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre douteuses. Aux dires de l\u2019ARC, il avait ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans le vol de 150 000 $ \u00e0 son employeur, et des armes \u00e0 feu avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvertes \u00e0 son domicile lors d\u2019une perquisition[4]. M. Monette \u00e9tait en phase terminale lorsqu\u2019il a fait sa d\u00e9claration sous serment.\n[18] L\u2019ARQ a conclu que Termont et Desco \u00e9taient deux des principaux clients d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et Andr\u00e9 Auger, le comptable de Termont, l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que Termont avait utilis\u00e9 les esp\u00e8ces pour payer certains de ses fournisseurs qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 d\u2019identifier. Cependant, apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification de Termont et d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, ainsi que de leurs actionnaires, y compris un rapprochement tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des relev\u00e9s bancaires et une v\u00e9rification approfondie des achats et des ventes, l\u2019ARQ n\u2019a pas pu conclure qu\u2019une quelconque partie des esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9es par Garda avait constitu\u00e9 un paiement pour des achats effectu\u00e9s entre Termont et H\u00e9ritage.\n[19] Le comptable de Termont, M. Auger, a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ARQ que Termont utilisait les sommes en esp\u00e8ces pour payer ses fournisseurs afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention de sa banque. Il a refus\u00e9 d\u2019identifier les fournisseurs de Termont que M. Monette payait avec ces esp\u00e8ces. Il est \u00e0 noter que ni l\u2019ARC ni l\u2019ARQ n\u2019ont rep\u00e9r\u00e9 de ventes li\u00e9es non d\u00e9clar\u00e9es qu\u2019H\u00e9ritage aurait faites \u00e0 Termont ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit d\u2019autre.\n[20] Guy Chevalier, une autre personne ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ces op\u00e9rations, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales au sujet de sa participation et de ce qu\u2019il savait. Son entreprise, Desco, menait \u00e9galement des activit\u00e9s dans le secteur de la volaille. M. Chevalier n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre par aucune des parties dans le pr\u00e9sent appel. Toutefois, lorsque les autorit\u00e9s fiscales l\u2019ont interrog\u00e9 dans le cadre de leurs enqu\u00eates et de leurs v\u00e9rifications, il a expliqu\u00e9 avoir organis\u00e9 ces op\u00e9rations afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le financement de son inventaire de volaille et de ses cr\u00e9ances aupr\u00e8s de sa banque. Les op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es ont permis \u00e0 son entreprise d\u2019inscrire aux livres la vente d\u2019une partie de son inventaire \u00e0 une des autres parties concern\u00e9es et d\u2019en faire une cr\u00e9ance, puis une somme re\u00e7ue, m\u00eame si les op\u00e9rations se poursuivaient puisqu\u2019il rachetait les m\u00eames inventaires \u00e0 l\u2019autre entreprise. On a \u00e9galement soutenu que ces op\u00e9rations aidaient Desco \u00e0 g\u00e9rer ses probl\u00e8mes de quotas. Il est difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir si les volailles de Desco ont quitt\u00e9 son entrep\u00f4t pour y revenir. Je n\u2019ai obtenu aucun d\u00e9tail quant \u00e0 ses conventions bancaires ou \u00e0 son financement bancaire. Desco comptait environ 250 employ\u00e9s et ses revenus \u00e9taient de l\u2019ordre de 30 millions de dollars. Ni l\u2019ARC ni l\u2019ARQ n\u2019ont soumis Desco \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification en lien avec ceci, mais leurs v\u00e9rifications d\u2019H\u00e9ritage n\u2019ont relev\u00e9 aucune op\u00e9ration d\u2019achat ou de vente entre H\u00e9ritage et Desco qu\u2019H\u00e9ritage n\u2019avait pas d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9e et comptabilis\u00e9e. Les ventes de volaille constituaient le seul lien entre H\u00e9ritage et Termont. \u00c0 la connaissance d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et de M. Paquet, ces deux entreprises n\u2019avaient aucun client en commun.\n[21] Bien que les autorit\u00e9s fiscales aient interrog\u00e9 M. Chevalier dans le cadre de leur enqu\u00eate et de leur v\u00e9rification des appelants, leurs enqu\u00eates et v\u00e9rifications au sujet de M. Chevalier et de Desco, de leur participation \u00e0 ces op\u00e9rations ou de leurs activit\u00e9s commerciales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 minimales, voir nulles. Les autorit\u00e9s fiscales n\u2019ont pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la banque qui finan\u00e7ait l\u2019inventaire de Desco si l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par M. Chevalier \u00e9tait ou non \u00e9tay\u00e9e par les dossiers bancaires de Desco.\n[22] L\u2019explication produite par M. Chevalier n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement incompatible avec celle de M. Auger.\n[23] M\u00eame si cela n\u2019est pas absolument n\u00e9cessaire dans les appels de M. Paquet et d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, je ne suis pas en mesure de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la provenance des sommes d\u2019argent en banque de Termont, que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame en passant par Garda et en utilisant l\u2019adresse d\u2019un \u00e9difice o\u00f9 H\u00e9ritage menait ses activit\u00e9s. L\u2019ARQ n\u2019a pas pu conclure que les esp\u00e8ces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es de nouveau sur le compte de Termont, de M. Monette ou de sa conjointe, ni qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9es ou autrement utilis\u00e9es dans le cadre des activit\u00e9s de Termont ou \u00e0 toute autre fin.\n[24] Les v\u00e9rificatrices de l\u2019ARQ et de l\u2019ARC, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de l\u2019ARC et l\u2019agent de recouvrement de l\u2019ARC ont expliqu\u00e9 que les deux agences se sont employ\u00e9es diligemment, pendant cinq ans, \u00e0 tenter de faire la lumi\u00e8re sur la situation entourant les livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces par Garda. Je ne dois pas obligatoirement trancher cette question, m\u00eame s\u2019il serait certainement utile de le faire. Je dois seulement me prononcer sur l\u2019exactitude des nouvelles cotisations de M. Paquet et d\u2019H\u00e9ritage.\n[25] Malgr\u00e9 cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019enqu\u00eate et de v\u00e9rifications, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas, pendant toute la semaine qu\u2019a dur\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s, produit suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante que les cotisations sont exactes et il n\u2019a pas non plus, lors de son contre-interrogatoire des appelants et de leurs t\u00e9moins, r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire na\u00eetre des doutes suffisants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de leurs t\u00e9moignages.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a gu\u00e8re produite de preuves portant que les autorit\u00e9s fiscales ont cherch\u00e9 avec diligence la source initiale ou le destinataire final de ces esp\u00e8ces. Aucune provenance ou utilisation n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et des v\u00e9rifications men\u00e9es pendant cinq ans par les deux autorit\u00e9s fiscales. De toute \u00e9vidence, elles n\u2019ont pas exerc\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de leurs comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019enqu\u00eate, de v\u00e9rification et de collecte de renseignements en vue d\u2019obtenir ces informations cl\u00e9s.\n[27] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve t\u00e9moignent du peu d\u2019efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales, inform\u00e9es directement par M. Chevalier, pour tenter de comprendre comment fonctionnait la strat\u00e9gie de Desco et \u00e0 qui elle profitait, pour la confirmer ou l\u2019\u00e9carter. Les autorit\u00e9s fiscales avaient le pouvoir d\u2019obtenir ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00eatre en mesure de les pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Cour s\u2019ils appuyaient les cotisations en litige. Elles n\u2019ont donn\u00e9 aucune raison satisfaisante de ne pas l\u2019avoir fait avant de d\u00e9cider d\u2019\u00e9tablir une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Paquet et d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, et encore moins avant l\u2019audience. Les appelants, m\u00eame s\u2019ils auraient pu obliger M. Chevalier \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, n\u2019ont aucun des droits qu\u2019ont les agences de mener des v\u00e9rifications et des enqu\u00eates au pr\u00e9alable.\n[28] Il en va de m\u00eame quant aux v\u00e9rifications des appelants. Aucune des deux agences n\u2019a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse de la valeur nette ou \u00e0 un rapprochement complet des relev\u00e9s bancaires, ni eu recours \u00e0 une autre m\u00e9thode de v\u00e9rification. L\u2019ARC s\u2019est uniquement int\u00e9ress\u00e9e aux d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et aux retraits bancaires concernant une des banques de M. Paquet, m\u00eame si elle savait qu\u2019il faisait affaire avec au moins deux autres banques. L\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas compar\u00e9 son mode de vie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ni son niveau de vie \u00e0 ses sources de revenus ou de capitaux.\n[29] Il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissant que M. Paquet disposait d\u2019avoirs importants autres que les suivants : sa moiti\u00e9 de la r\u00e9sidence familiale de classe moyenne hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e, un chalet d\u2019une valeur de 300 000 $ \u00e0 Mont\u2011Tremblant qu\u2019il mettait parfois en location, un bateau co\u00fbteux et un condo d\u2019une valeur de 500 000 $ \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, appartenant \u00e0 son entreprise et mis \u00e0 sa disposition, qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 et comptabilis\u00e9. Rien de tout cela n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en esp\u00e8ces. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que le revenu d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de M. Paquet ne permettait pas d\u2019expliquer l\u2019achat, au cours d\u2019une des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es, d\u2019une Bentley neuve qu\u2019il a ensuite \u00e9chang\u00e9e contre une Rolls Royce neuve. Cependant, les autorit\u00e9s fiscales n\u2019avaient pas tenu compte du fait que le revenu d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de M. Paquet au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e en question ou de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente comprenait un gain en capital imposable de 800 000 $, ce qui signifiait que M. Paquet d\u00e9tenait \u00e9galement la partie non imposable du gain en capital qui suffisait amplement pour expliquer l\u2019achat d\u2019une voiture de luxe. En outre, le prix d\u2019achat a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du compte bancaire de M. Paquet, et non en esp\u00e8ces. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement reconnu que le v\u00e9hicule Range Rover sur lequel les autorit\u00e9s fiscales s\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9galement concentr\u00e9es \u00e9tait un v\u00e9hicule lou\u00e9 par l\u2019entreprise de M. Paquet et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 et comptabilis\u00e9.\n[30] L\u2019\u00e9difice o\u00f9 Garda livrait l\u2019argent comptait quatre bureaux. Un des bureaux \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 par le cabinet comptable d\u2019Alain Lemay, dont les appelants retenaient les services. Un autre \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 par Maria D\u2019Amico, la r\u00e9ceptionniste de l\u2019\u00e9difice qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au service d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. Toute personne qui entrait dans l\u2019\u00e9difice devait passer par son bureau. Mme D\u2019Amico \u00e9tait \u00e9galement aide-comptable au sein du cabinet comptable de M. Lemay. Le troisi\u00e8me bureau \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re ou une entreprise de construction, et le quatri\u00e8me bureau \u00e9tait celui de M. Paquet.\n[31] M. Paquet ne connaissait pas M. Auger, le comptable de Termont. \u00c0 part la satisfaction d\u2019un client d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, les appelants ne retiraient rien du fait qu\u2019ils autorisaient Termont ou M. Monette \u00e0 utiliser l\u2019adresse commerciale d\u2019H\u00e9ritage pour les livraisons de Garda. M. Paquet avait bien compris que M. Monette versait des paiements en esp\u00e8ces \u00e0 un ou plusieurs fournisseurs de Termont. M. Paquet ne savait pas qui apposait normalement sa signature lors des livraisons effectu\u00e9es par Garda. Termont achetait de la volaille \u00e0 H\u00e9ritage et lui en fournissait.\n[32] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme D\u2019Amico a affirm\u00e9 que M. Monette \u00e9tait souvent pr\u00e9sent dans leurs bureaux pour les livraisons de Garda. Lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait absent, il appelait Mme D\u2019Amico pour la pr\u00e9venir que Garda passerait; elle apposait alors sa signature pour recevoir le paquet qu\u2019elle conservait dans son bureau jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de M. Monette, qui venait rapidement r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le paquet. \u00c9tant r\u00e9ceptionniste, Mme D\u2019Amico apposait sa signature pour d\u2019autres livraisons non li\u00e9es destin\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres locataires dans l\u2019\u00e9difice.\n[33] Natalie Paquet, qui est la s\u0153ur de M. Paquet, exer\u00e7ait les fonctions d\u2019adjointe administrative pour H\u00e9ritage. Elle \u00e9tait parfois pr\u00e9sente dans ces locaux d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et il lui est arriv\u00e9 d\u2019apposer sa signature lors des livraisons de Garda si M. Monette n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent, vraisemblablement parce que Mme D\u2019Amico n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour apposer sa signature et garder le paquet dans son bureau. Lorsque Natalie Paquet apposait sa signature pour ce type de livraison, elle laissait l\u2019argent dans le bureau de son fr\u00e8re. Elle ne savait pas ce qu\u2019il advenait de cet argent.\n[34] Le vice-pr\u00e9sident des op\u00e9rations de Garda au Qu\u00e9bec a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Monette une fois et qu\u2019il ne connaissait ni M. Paquet ni H\u00e9ritage. Le contrat de Garda pour les livraisons a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu avec Termont et pr\u00e9cise que cette derni\u00e8re est destinataire des livraisons. Les bordereaux de livraison indiquent \u00e9galement que Termont est destinataire des livraisons.\n[35] C\u2019est Mme Skaf, de l\u2019ARQ, qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de Termont. Elle a confirm\u00e9 avoir conclu, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de sa v\u00e9rification, que Termont avait des revenus d\u2019environ 60 millions de dollars. Elle a admis des d\u00e9penses d\u2019environ 30 millions de dollars compte tenu du fait que MM. Monette et Auger lui avaient dit que l\u2019entreprise avait d\u2019importantes d\u00e9penses en esp\u00e8ces; elle a conclu que tel \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s probablement le cas et a pr\u00eat\u00e9 foi aux dires de MM. Monette et Auger. Sa v\u00e9rification n\u2019a permis de relever aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve selon lequel d\u2019autres personnes que M. Monette contr\u00f4laient le compte bancaire de Termont. Elle n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 les re\u00e7us sign\u00e9s de Garda pour voir qui avait appos\u00e9 sa signature. Elle ne savait pas qui avait sign\u00e9 la plupart des re\u00e7us, mais elle savait que M. Paquet avait appos\u00e9 sa signature pour une livraison. Elle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant que M. Paquet \u00e9tait le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de ces esp\u00e8ces, \u00e0 part le lien \u00e9tabli par le fait que les esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es par Garda au lieu d\u2019affaires d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. Elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Paquet s\u2019il savait ce qu\u2019il advenait des esp\u00e8ces; elle n\u2019a pos\u00e9 cette question qu\u2019\u00e0 M. Auger. Elle avait \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de M. Monette et des deux appelants. Elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas non plus pos\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 M. Paquet lors de ces v\u00e9rifications.\n[36] M. Sawyer, l\u2019agent de recouvrement de l\u2019ARC, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ses enqu\u00eates l\u2019avaient amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que ni Termont ni le patrimoine de M. Monette ne d\u00e9tenaient d\u2019actifs. Il ne savait pas que l\u2019ARQ avait conclu que Termont avait des revenus de 60 millions de dollars et a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que s\u2019il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, il aurait examin\u00e9 Termont de nouveau. M. Sawyer a discut\u00e9 plusieurs fois avec M. Chevalier, sans toutefois pouvoir conclure que les fausses op\u00e9rations ou les fausses ventes \u00e9voqu\u00e9es par MM. Auger et Chevalier n\u2019avaient pas eu lieu et n\u2019expliquaient pas les livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces par Garda. M. Sawyer a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait vu aucune raison de mettre en doute la d\u00e9claration sous serment de M. Monette et il a reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que les esp\u00e8ces transport\u00e9es par Garda n\u2019appartenaient ni \u00e0 H\u00e9ritage ni \u00e0 M. Paquet. Il croyait savoir, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que lui avaient dit ses coll\u00e8gues du recouvrement de l\u2019ARQ, que M. Monette vivait largement; il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de bijoux de valeur, d\u2019une collection de cartes de hockey et d\u2019un Riopelle. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait eu aucune raison de douter de la d\u00e9claration sous serment de Jean Hamel, qui avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 savoir que les esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9es \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 Termont ou \u00e0 M. Monette puisqu\u2019il avait personnellement remis certaines enveloppes \u00e0 M. Monette. M. Sawyer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses enqu\u00eates et ses efforts ont constitu\u00e9 une grande partie de son travail pendant un ou deux ans et qu\u2019il aurait pu consacrer un millier d\u2019heures \u00e0 ce dossier. Il a confirm\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait en fonction dans l\u2019\u00e9quipe des recouvrements et non celle de la v\u00e9rification, \u00e0 sa connaissance, toutes les op\u00e9rations effectu\u00e9es par M. Paquet et son entreprise \u00e9taient comptabilis\u00e9es, d\u00e9clar\u00e9es aux autorit\u00e9s fiscales et inscrites dans les dossiers bancaires de M. Paquet et de son entreprise, sans aucun indice ou ou\u00ef-dire quant au fait que des esp\u00e8ces en caisse \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es.\n[37] Genevi\u00e8ve Robillard \u00e9tait la v\u00e9rificatrice de l\u2019ARC qui a men\u00e9 les v\u00e9rifications de Termont, de M. Monette, d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et de M. Paquet. Elle est comptable professionnelle agr\u00e9\u00e9e (\u00ab CPA \u00bb), d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en sciences comptables, et occupe depuis plus de 20 ans des postes en v\u00e9rification au sein de l\u2019ARC.\n[38] Elle s\u2019est tout d\u2019abord occup\u00e9e des v\u00e9rifications de Termont et de M. Monette. Elle a obtenu les documents de travail et les cotisations de l\u2019ARQ. Elle a \u00e9tabli des cotisations miroirs \u00e0 celles de l\u2019ARQ sans effectuer d\u2019autre travail de v\u00e9rification.\n[39] Mme Robillard a ensuite effectu\u00e9 les v\u00e9rifications d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et de M. Paquet. Elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre analyse des relev\u00e9s bancaires de M. Paquet \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019ARQ ne lui avait pas transmis de copie d\u2019une telle analyse. Elle a \u00e9tabli des cotisations correspondantes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Paquet. Lorsqu\u2019est venu le tour d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, l\u2019ARC n\u2019a pas suivi la m\u00eame approche que l\u2019ARQ pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation d\u2019H\u00e9ritage et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019inclure dans le revenu d\u2019H\u00e9ritage toutes les sommes livr\u00e9es par Garda \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour les raisons suivantes : (i) M. Monette s\u2019est r\u00e9tract\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9e sous serment, (ii) M. Auger a affirm\u00e9 que les esp\u00e8ces servaient \u00e0 payer des fournisseurs, (iii) les esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, et (iv) H\u00e9ritage \u00e9tait un fournisseur de Termont \u2013 bien qu\u2019aucune des deux agences n\u2019ait trouv\u00e9 la preuve de ventes conclues en esp\u00e8ces.\n[40] Mme Robillard s\u2019est bel et bien adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Chevalier et a appris que la facturation entre Desco et les entreprises de M. Paquet \u00e9tait fausse, tout comme les op\u00e9rations et les ventes, le but \u00e9tant d\u2019inscrire les ventes dans les comptes de Desco.\n[41] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Robillard a permis de confirmer que, lors de la v\u00e9rification des appelants pour le compte de l\u2019ARC :\nelle n\u2019a pas rapproch\u00e9 les paiements qu\u2019H\u00e9ritage a vers\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Paquet;\nelle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 si M. Paquet d\u00e9posait tous ses revenus;\nelle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Paquet s\u2019il d\u00e9posait tous ses revenus;\nelle a envisag\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir la valeur nette, mais ne l\u2019a pas fait et a reconnu que les cotisations de valeur nette n\u00e9cessitaient beaucoup de travail;\nelle n\u2019a pas compris comment se faisaient les achats et les ventes par les interm\u00e9diaires du secteur de la volaille, malgr\u00e9 les explications re\u00e7ues d\u2019un tiers;\nelle n\u2019a pas pu retracer les esp\u00e8ces en caisse \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est r\u00e9ellement difficile de le faire, elle a perdu la trace des esp\u00e8ces lorsqu\u2019elle tentait de les retracer et elle n\u2019a absolument pas pu retracer les esp\u00e8ces apr\u00e8s leur remise \u00e0 M. Monette par Garda, mais elle sentait que quelque chose n\u2019allait pas m\u00eame si elle ne savait pas tr\u00e8s bien quoi;\nelle a pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une \u00ab strat\u00e9gie in-out \u00bb, mais elle n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 les comptes de Desco et n\u2019a donc pas pu suivre la trace de l\u2019argent;\nelle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de dire si les esp\u00e8ces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 oui ou non d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans un compte;\nelle a \u00e9tabli une cotisation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019H\u00e9ritage concernant des revenus non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Paquet pour avoir tir\u00e9 un avantage personnel des revenus non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s d\u2019H\u00e9ritage;\nelle n\u2019a pas analys\u00e9 les relev\u00e9s bancaires de Desco ni de personne d\u2019autre pour tenter d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019origine des esp\u00e8ces et savoir ce que ces sommes \u00e9taient devenues. Cela sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019efforts pour \u00e9tablir la provenance des esp\u00e8ces ou retrouver cet argent;\nelle ne savait pas ce que voulait dire M. Chevalier lorsqu\u2019il a indiqu\u00e9 que les factures et les ventes en esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient \u00ab fausses \u00bb;\nelle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Chevalier s\u2019il savait qui contr\u00f4lait le compte bancaire de Termont ou si ce compte \u00e9tait contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par d\u2019autres personnes que M. Monette;\nelle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019opinion quant \u00e0 savoir si elle avait la moindre raison de mettre en doute le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des t\u00e9moins des appelants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure);\nelle n\u2019a pas analys\u00e9 le mode de vie de M. Paquet, mais \u00e9tait indirectement au courant du fait qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait une voiture tr\u00e8s ch\u00e8re, qu\u2019il fr\u00e9quentait des casinos et qu\u2019il partait en vacances;\nelle n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 bon de douter de l\u2019explication de M. Auger voulant que les esp\u00e8ces aient servi \u00e0 payer un ou plusieurs fournisseurs de Desco;\nelle n\u2019a pas conclu, apr\u00e8s son analyse des comptes bancaires, qu\u2019il y avait des montants pr\u00e9cis de revenus non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s;\nelle n\u2019a pas estim\u00e9 que la carte de cr\u00e9dit que M. Monette a mise \u00e0 la disposition de M. Paquet \u00e9tait pertinente dans le cadre des cotisations de l\u2019ARC \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les cotisations tenaient simplement compte de l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des sommes livr\u00e9es par Garda[5];\nelle ne savait pas qui contr\u00f4lait le compte bancaire de Termont, qui contr\u00f4lait le montant des livraisons de Garda et le moment auquel elles avaient lieu, d\u2019o\u00f9 venaient les esp\u00e8ces remises \u00e0 Garda par Termont, qui contr\u00f4lait l\u2019enveloppe de Garda lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait livr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adresse d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, ni l\u2019utilisation qui \u00e9tait finalement faite de ces esp\u00e8ces. Elle estimait que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de l\u2019ARQ \u00e9tait plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce genre de questions puisque c\u2019\u00e9tait le but de son enqu\u00eate;\nelle n\u2019a signal\u00e9 aucun fait \u00e9tayant la th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulant que M. Paquet ait contr\u00f4l\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation ou la destination des esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9es.\n[42] J\u2019ai conclu que Mme Robillard avait parfois une attitude tr\u00e8s d\u00e9fensive quand elle a donn\u00e9 certaines de ces r\u00e9ponses lors du contre-interrogatoire. Ses r\u00e9ponses ne vont pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 porter atteinte \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 puisqu\u2019elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des r\u00e9ponses d\u00e9favorables, et a parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 encourag\u00e9e par les objections non fond\u00e9es et les interruptions de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pendant son contre-interrogatoire.\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9, dans des appels en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t portant sur des revenus non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, n\u2019a pas besoin de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer la provenance des revenus ni l\u2019utilisation qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Un exemple \u00e9vident est celui d\u2019une cotisation de valeur nette, o\u00f9 l\u2019ARC se concentre plut\u00f4t sur d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour \u00e9tayer sa cotisation, que le contribuable appelant doit ensuite contester ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle il doit produire de meilleurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant son revenu. Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les cotisations des appelants reposaient simplement sur le montant en esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9 par Garda. Pour cette raison, la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans les pr\u00e9sents appels est marqu\u00e9e par une accumulation de faiblesses dans les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[44] Compte tenu notamment de ce que M. Chevalier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux agences du revenu quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet de ces op\u00e9rations en esp\u00e8ces et du fait que l\u2019argent revenait bel et bien \u00e0 la case d\u00e9part, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Auger a partiellement corrobor\u00e9 ces d\u00e9clarations, le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Chevalier, \u00e0 M. Auger ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 Desco d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience et de t\u00e9moigner devant notre Cour permet de conclure qu\u2019un tel t\u00e9moignage n\u2019aurait probablement pas aid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve \u00e9taye les cotisations en litige.\n[45] Mme Chiu \u00e9tait l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de l\u2019ARQ charg\u00e9e de ces dossiers. Depuis 2017, elle est au service de l\u2019ARC. Les enqu\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvertes en septembre 2014 dans le cadre du Projet Volailles; elle y a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e en novembre 2014. Les enqu\u00eates effectu\u00e9es dans le cadre du Projet Volailles visaient non seulement H\u00e9ritage et M. Paquet, mais aussi Termont et M. Monette, ainsi que Desco et M. Chevalier.\n[46] Mme Chiu a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans plusieurs de ses r\u00e9ponses incertaines, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus acc\u00e8s aux dossiers pertinents de l\u2019ARQ concernant M. Paquet, H\u00e9ritage ou les autres. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas obtenu acc\u00e8s aux dossiers de l\u2019ARQ pour justifier les cotisations port\u00e9es en appel. Si c\u2019est exact, c\u2019est inattendu, \u00e9tonnant et d\u00e9cevant. Dans le cas contraire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb la corriger.\n[47] Mme Chiu a confirm\u00e9 ce qui suit dans son t\u00e9moignage :\nelle a conclu que M. Paquet contr\u00f4lait Termont, et donc le compte bancaire de Termont, d\u2019apr\u00e8s quelques courriels incomplets d\u00e9couverts sur un ordinateur appartenant \u00e0 H\u00e9ritage;\nelle ne savait pas si M. Paquet d\u00e9tenait d\u2019autres comptes bancaires;\nl\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019elle a men\u00e9e pour le compte de l\u2019ARQ n\u2019a pas permis de retracer les esp\u00e8ces apr\u00e8s leur livraison par Garda;\nelle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indiquant que les esp\u00e8ces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans un compte d\u00e9tenu par M. Paquet ou l\u2019une de ses entreprises;\nelle n\u2019a d\u00e9couvert aucun achat r\u00e9gl\u00e9 en esp\u00e8ces par M. Paquet relativement \u00e0 des avoirs ou des placements;\nelle ne se souvenait pas si elle avait d\u00e9couvert des op\u00e9rations en esp\u00e8ces impliquant H\u00e9ritage lors de son analyse des dossiers bancaires ou \u00e0 un autre moment;\nelle ne suivait pas la conclusion de Mme Skaf r\u00e9sultant de sa v\u00e9rification, portant que Termont menait de v\u00e9ritables activit\u00e9s produisant un revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise; elle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lant de v\u00e9ritables activit\u00e9s, seulement de faux re\u00e7us, de faux achats, de fausses ventes et des transferts d\u2019argent;\nles textos et les courriels qu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9s n\u2019indiquaient pas \u00e0 quelles fins les esp\u00e8ces \u00e9taient livr\u00e9es ni \u00e0 quelles fins elles \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es;\nelle n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 des textos ni des courriels avec M. Monette ni avec M. Paquet;\ntoutes les esp\u00e8ces mentionn\u00e9es figuraient dans les dossiers bancaires de Termont;\non n\u2019a pas retrouv\u00e9 de traces de directives adress\u00e9es par M. Paquet \u00e0 M. Monette;\nl\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de l\u2019ARQ n\u2019a pas eu acc\u00e8s aux factures pay\u00e9es avec les cartes de cr\u00e9dit de M. Monette qui sont en cause. Elle disposait uniquement des relev\u00e9s de carte de cr\u00e9dit et de compte bancaire. Il lui \u00e9tait impossible de savoir qui avait utilis\u00e9 quelle carte pour quel achat;\ndans son rapport, elle n\u2019a recommand\u00e9 aucune proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Paquet ni d\u2019H\u00e9ritage;\ndans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate Projet Volailles, Mme Chiu devait examiner Desco et M. Chevalier. Elle n\u2019a cependant pas indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour quelles conclusions, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019ARQ avait tir\u00e9es quant au r\u00f4le ou aux activit\u00e9s de Desco et de M. Chevalier dans les op\u00e9rations en cause sur lesquelles enqu\u00eatait l\u2019ARQ. Mme Chiu a seulement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir interrog\u00e9 M. Chevalier au sujet des faux re\u00e7us ainsi que des textos et des courriels en cause.\n[48] M\u00eame si M. Paquet \u00e9tait la personne qui indiquait les sommes \u00e0 livrer ou \u00e0 distribuer dans le cadre de ces op\u00e9rations faisant intervenir des livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces par Garda, cela n\u2019aide gu\u00e8re utile quant \u00e0 savoir si les appelants ont gard\u00e9 ou non ces sommes pour eux-m\u00eames.\nIV. Conclusion\n[49] Dans les pr\u00e9sents appels, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie financi\u00e8re de M. Chevalier et de Desco mettant en cause ces esp\u00e8ces, selon les explications donn\u00e9es par MM. Chevalier et Auger aux autorit\u00e9s et par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour, peuvent tout aussi bien expliquer que les d\u00e9cisions des agences que les appelants se sont appropri\u00e9 les esp\u00e8ces. De plus, la d\u00e9claration de M. Monette lui-m\u00eame quant au fait que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019argent de Termont, provenant du compte de Termont, qui lui \u00e9tait livr\u00e9 par Garda, conjugu\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve portant que M. Monette a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de ces esp\u00e8ces au bureau d\u2019H\u00e9ritage, serait compatible avec l\u2019id\u00e9e que Termont ou M. Monette ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019un des fournisseurs non identifi\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s par M. Auger impliqu\u00e9s dans le financement des inventaires de Desco plut\u00f4t que la strat\u00e9gie de planification financi\u00e8re concernant les cr\u00e9ances. Cela serait aussi compatible avec le fait que M. Monette r\u00e9cup\u00e9rait les esp\u00e8ces \u00e0 des fins personnelles autres, sans en laisser ou en redonner une partie directement ou indirectement \u00e0 H\u00e9ritage ou \u00e0 M. Paquet (ce dont il n\u2019existe de toute fa\u00e7on aucune preuve).\n[50] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans les pr\u00e9sents appels n\u2019indiquent absolument pas que l\u2019un des appelants ou les deux profitaient \u00e0 des fins personnelles de la totalit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une partie des esp\u00e8ces livr\u00e9es par Garda. Les appelants le nient. M. Chevalier et Desco, MM. Lemay, Auger et Houle ont tous donn\u00e9 des versions des faits qui iraient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une telle conclusion. L\u2019information produite par MM. Lemay et Chevalier mettait en cause d\u2019autres personnes que Termont, M. Monette, H\u00e9ritage et M. Paquet en ce qui concerne les livraisons d\u2019esp\u00e8ces par Garda.\n[51] Pour ces motifs, la Cour ne peut pas conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des\nprobabilit\u00e9s, que les cotisations en litige sont \u00e9tay\u00e9es par les faits mis en preuve, et les appels sont accueillis, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, Ontario, ce 16e jour de mai 2024.\n\u201cPatrick Boyle\u201d\nJuge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 69\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2019-2997(IT)G 2019-2998(IT)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DES CAUSES :\nSTEVE PAQUET ET SA MAJEST\u00c9 LE ROI\n4527976 CANADA INC.

(la \u00ab LIR \u00bb) pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011, de m\u00eame que de la d\u00e9cision du ministre de rejeter une demande de redressement d\u2019une T1 faite pour la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. La cotisation est dat\u00e9e du 7 septembre 2022, et le rejet de la demande est dat\u00e9 du 15 mars 2023.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que l\u2019appel de la cotisation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la Cour de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9, au motif que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019avis d\u2019opposition en bonne et due forme dans les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis en vertu de la LIR. L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime \u00e9galement que le refus du ministre d\u2019accepter la demande de redressement d\u2019une T1 rel\u00e8ve du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier, et que la Cour n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement saisie.\n[4] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il contestait uniquement le rejet par le ministre de sa demande de redressement d\u2019une T1, et il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition avait bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9lais impartis en vertu de la LIR.\nII \u2013 \u00c9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents et chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements\n[5] L\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en son nom propre. Voici une chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements bas\u00e9e sur son t\u00e9moignage et sur les preuves documentaires :\n[6] L\u2019appelant travaillait en tant que fonctionnaire de carri\u00e8re et \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 par Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada. Il souffrait d\u2019une affection de longue date qui provoquait une fatigue extr\u00eame et affectait sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir ses obligations professionnelles. Il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de produire ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus depuis 2004.\n[7] Il a finalement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de cr\u00e9dit d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour personnes handicap\u00e9es (le \u00ab CIPH \u00bb) le 12 ao\u00fbt 2014. Apr\u00e8s quelques v\u00e9rifications initiales, le ministre a \u00e9mis un avis de d\u00e9termination faisant droit \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019appelant pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2014 \u00e0 2018. Le ministre a par la suite \u00e9largi l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant pour inclure l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale 2005 et les ann\u00e9es suivantes.\n[8] Par une lettre dat\u00e9e du 13 novembre 2018, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab ARC \u00bb) a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant aurait le droit de demander le CIPH [traduction] \u00ab pour certaines de ces ann\u00e9es \u00bb, mais que seules les demandes [traduction] \u00ab pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant dans l\u2019une des dix ann\u00e9es civiles qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 vous faites votre demande peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00bb. Malgr\u00e9 cela, l\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 par la suite ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 \u00e0 propos du d\u00e9lai de dix ans.\n[9] Entre-temps, le ministre a exig\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il produise ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2011 \u00e0 2014. Une fois que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au CIPH a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie pour inclure les ann\u00e9es 2005 et les suivantes, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu de produire une d\u00e9claration de revenus pour ces ann\u00e9es-l\u00e0 \u00e9galement.\n[10] Le 25 septembre 2018, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019ARC pour demander un redressement pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008 \u00e0 2017, afin que le CIPH soit pris en consid\u00e9ration. L\u2019ARC a cependant refus\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der aux redressements, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas produit ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es en question.\n[11] L\u2019appelant a finalement pu surmonter ses difficult\u00e9s et a rassembl\u00e9 les informations n\u00e9cessaires pour produire ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2008, 2009 et 2010. Les demandes de redressement de T1 ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es afin que le CIPH soit inclus pour ces ann\u00e9es.\n[12] Toutefois, l\u2019appelant a rencontr\u00e9 d\u2019autres difficult\u00e9s pour produire ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les autres ann\u00e9es. Le 2 mai 2022, il a enfin pu produire sa d\u00e9claration de revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011. Il a demand\u00e9 une d\u00e9duction pour une cotisation de 25 472,00 $ \u00e0 un REER, ainsi qu\u2019un remboursement de 2 189,53 $ d\u00e9coulant du CIPH.\n[13] Le ministre a \u00e9tabli la cotisation le 7 septembre 2022, refusant tous les remboursements demand\u00e9s pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2011 au motif que la demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite plus de dix ans apr\u00e8s la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile vis\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelant disait [traduction] \u00ab nous ne pouvons pas vous rembourser l\u2019imp\u00f4t pay\u00e9 en trop \u00bb.\n[14] Dans son t\u00e9moignage oral, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de demander une d\u00e9duction pour une partie du montant de sa contribution au REER pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011, puis de reporter le reste du montant aux ann\u00e9es suivantes. Il a dit avoir compris alors qu\u2019il perdrait l\u2019avantage d\u2019appliquer la d\u00e9duction \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011. L\u2019appelant s\u2019est plaint de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 au sujet de la limite de dix ans et a fourni de nombreux exemples de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des conseils au sujet de son r\u00e9gime de retraite ou des informations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t de la part des fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[15] Au fil des discussions qu\u2019il a entretenues avec l\u2019ARC, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 penser qu\u2019une solution envisageable serait de d\u00e9poser une demande de redressement d\u2019une T1 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011. Il a suivi ce conseil et a ainsi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de redressement d\u2019une T1 le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2022 (la \u00ab demande de redressement \u00bb). Comme il l\u2019explique dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 un [traduction] \u00ab rajustement se rapportant \u00e0 une seule ligne [...] pour r\u00e9duire ou \u00e9liminer le montant de la d\u00e9duction demand\u00e9e au titre d\u2019une contribution \u00e0 un REER, laquelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011 par erreur \u00bb.\n[16] Le 15 mars 2023, le ministre a rejet\u00e9 la demande de redressement en sp\u00e9cifiant que [traduction] \u00ab les mesures d\u2019all\u00e8gement pour les contribuables ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux demandes de nouvelle cotisation concernant des d\u00e9ductions admissibles \u00bb dans les cas o\u00f9 le contribuable [traduction] \u00ab est libre de choisir \u00e0 quel moment, comment et quel montant d\u00e9duire pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[17] Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est renseign\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ARC, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est vu r\u00e9pondre qu\u2019en essayant de corriger la d\u00e9duction demand\u00e9e au titre d\u2019une cotisation \u00e0 un REER pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011, il amor\u00e7ait une planification fiscale r\u00e9troactive, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9. L\u2019appelant a ni\u00e9, expliquant qu\u2019il tentait simplement de corriger une erreur ou un oubli manifeste.\n[18] Le 12 juin 2023, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation et y a joint une demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai. \u00c0 la m\u00eame date, il a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition distinct concernant le rejet de sa demande de redressement d\u2019une T1 par le ministre.\n[19] Le ministre a r\u00e9pondu le 15 ao\u00fbt 2023, refusant d\u2019accepter l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la cotisation au motif que l\u2019appelant [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019oppos[ait] \u00e0 un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t frapp\u00e9 de prescription \u00bb et que l\u2019avis ne pouvait \u00eatre accept\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab en tant qu\u2019opposition valide, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la question n\u2019est pas trait\u00e9e comme faisant partie de la cotisation visant l\u2019imp\u00f4t, les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb.\n[20] Dans ses observations finales, l\u2019appelant fourni un recueil conjoint de jurisprudence et de la doctrine et fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions, notamment Canada c. Nassau Walnut Investments Inc., (1997) 2 CF 279 (\u00ab Nassau \u00bb), Weber c. La Reine, 2001 CanLII 478 (CCI) (\u00ab Weber \u00bb), Watanabe c. La Reine, 1999 CanLII 474 (CCI) (\u00ab Watanabe \u00bb) et Moulton c. La Reine, 2002 CanLII 798 (CCI) (\u00ab Moulton \u00bb). Toutes ces d\u00e9cisions concernent des conseils fournis par l\u2019ARC et une all\u00e9gation de planification fiscale r\u00e9troactive.\n[21] Dans l\u2019affaire Nassau, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a estim\u00e9 que les faits dont elle \u00e9tait saisie n\u2019impliquaient pas une \u00ab planification fiscale r\u00e9troactive \u00bb, indiquant que \u00ab le cas [...] [\u00e9tait] plus semblable \u00e0 une situation dans laquelle le contribuable demande \u00e0 modifier sa d\u00e9claration d\u2019imp\u00f4t afin de tirer parti d\u2019une d\u00e9duction \u00e0 laquelle il a un certain droit \u00bb.\n[22] La Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Nassau et est parvenue \u00e0 une conclusion similaire dans l\u2019affaire Weber.\n[23] Dans l\u2019affaire Watanabe, la contribuable avait \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e par les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC \u00e0 croire qu\u2019elle avait le droit de cotiser \u00e0 son fond de retraite et \u00e0 son REER pour ensuite d\u00e9duire ces montants au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieure. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e plus tard qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas le faire et s\u2019est rendu compte que les cotisations seraient imposables dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 au moment de leur retrait. Cela a conduit le juge Bowman \u00e0 conclure que \u00ab [l]a crainte [de la contribuable] d\u2019\u00eatre impos\u00e9e deux fois \u00bb \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Au paragraphe 15, il fait le commentaire suivant :\nDe toute \u00e9vidence, je n\u2019ai pas le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner au ministre de faire une remise aux termes de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques. Cependant, je peux exprimer l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il serait tr\u00e8s appropri\u00e9 qu\u2019il le fasse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Autrement, je ne peux venir en aide \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. [...]\n[24] Enfin, dans l\u2019affaire Moulton, le contribuable s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9 sur les conseils des fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC avant de verser une cotisation \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime de retraite, puisqu\u2019il avait compris qu\u2019elle pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9duite au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e post\u00e9rieure. Il a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le montant de sa cotisation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9ductible, ce qui a conduit le juge Bowman \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l\u2019observation qu\u2019il avait faite dans l\u2019affaire Watanabe au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de remise, tout en concluant qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de changer les choses pour aider le contribuable.\n[25] Je reviens sur cette jurisprudence plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\nIII \u2013 D\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition valide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la cotisation\n[26] Passons \u00e0 la question du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition valide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la cotisation. Bien que l\u2019appelant ait affirm\u00e9 ne pas contester la position du ministre, la formulation de son avis d\u2019appel semble sugg\u00e9rer le contraire; quelques remarques \u00e0 ce sujet s\u2019imposent.\n[27] Il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans les 90 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation, mais qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 12 mois qui a suivi. L\u2019appelant avait inclus une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition.\n[28] Lorsque le ministre a communiqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de rejeter la demande, le 15 ao\u00fbt 2023, l\u2019appelant aurait pu d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s de la Cour pour demander une prorogation du d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un l\u2019avis d\u2019opposition, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 166.2(1) de la LIR. La Cour aurait alors examin\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9 de la demande \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 166.2(5) de la LIR. L\u2019appelant ne l\u2019a pas fait; il a plut\u00f4t interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision.\n[29] La jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019opposition est une condition pr\u00e9alable au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un avis d\u2019appel. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on comprend \u00e0 la lecture du paragraphe 169(1) de la LIR, dont les premiers mots sont : \u00ab Lorsqu\u2019un contribuable a signifi\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 une cotisation, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 165, il peut interjeter appel [...] \u00bb.\n[30] La Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour modifier ou prolonger les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par la Couronne, comme le confirme l\u2019arr\u00eat Bormann c. Canada, 2006 CAF 83 (par. 3 \u00e0 6); ainsi, l\u2019appel de la cotisation doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\nIV \u2013 La demande de redressement\n[31] Abordons la question du rejet par le ministre de la demande de redressement faite pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011. Le ministre n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu express\u00e9ment r\u00e9pondu au deuxi\u00e8me avis d\u2019objection du 12 juin 2023, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en lien avec sa d\u00e9cision du 15 mars 2023 de rejeter la demande de l\u2019appelant.\n[32] L\u2019appelant assure qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans les 90 jours. Malgr\u00e9 cela, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un avis d\u2019objection valide, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il vise \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une question d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel et qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence de notre Cour.\n[33] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]a comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de l\u2019imp\u00f4t est circonscrite par la Loi; dans les affaires d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, elle entend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les appels relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019exactitude des cotisations. Elle ne peut proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions du ministre rendues en application des dispositions d\u2019all\u00e8gement discr\u00e9tionnaires de la Loi [...] \u00bb : Bonnybrook Park Industrial Development Co. Ltd. c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national), 2018 CAF 136 (par. 19).\n[34] Le recours dont disposait l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019interjeter appel devant la Cour, mais plut\u00f4t de demander un deuxi\u00e8me examen administratif de la d\u00e9cision du ministre du 12 mars 2023 et, en cas d\u2019\u00e9chec, de demander un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[35] Dans son avis d\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant admet qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ne connait pas l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019avancement de sa demande d\u2019all\u00e8gement et qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me examen administratif de cette m\u00eame demande [...] \u00bb. On lui aurait r\u00e9pondu que \u00ab cela pouvait prendre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 17 mois \u00bb. Il semble donc que la demande soit en suspens. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, cette question ne peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par la Cour.\n[36] Subsidiairement, ou peut-\u00eatre simultan\u00e9ment, l\u2019appelant pourrait demander une remise en vertu de l\u2019article 23 de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, L.R.C., 1985, ch. F 11, comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 le juge Bowman dans les affaires Watanabe et Moulton. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment dans l\u2019affaire Dunn c. The Queen, 2022 CCI 44 (par. 11 et 12).\n[37] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant, il n\u2019est pas manifeste aux yeux de la Cour qu\u2019il se soit livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une planification fiscale r\u00e9troactive lorsqu\u2019il a cotis\u00e9 \u00e0 son REER en f\u00e9vrier 2022, s\u2019attendant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9duction d\u00e9coulant de cette cotisation puisse \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011, et possiblement aux ann\u00e9es suivantes. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 un contribuable cherche \u00e0 modifier une d\u00e9claration de revenus d\u00e9pos\u00e9e plus de dix ans auparavant. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la demande de redressement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans les douze mois suivant la production de la d\u00e9claration de revenus et la cotisation au REER.\nV \u2013 Conclusion\n[38] En fin de compte, peu importe que la Cour admette ou non la plainte de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle les fonctionnaires de l\u2019ARC ne l\u2019ont pas bien conseill\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t : cela ne change rien au fait que notre Cour n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n[39] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019appel est annul\u00e9.\n[40] Aucuns d\u00e9pens ne sont adjug\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa (Ontario), ce 22e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Guy R.

CONTEXTE\n[1] La Fiducie Historia (la \u00ab fiducie \u00bb ou \u00ab l\u2019appelante \u00bb), est une fiducie discr\u00e9tionnaire constitu\u00e9e en vertu des lois de la province du Qu\u00e9bec. Pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2013 et 2015, elle a attribu\u00e9 30 072 000 $ et 20 250 000 $, respectivement, \u00e0 un de ses b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. Elle a ensuite d\u00e9duit ces montants de ses revenus pour chacune des ann\u00e9es d'imposition en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb).\n[2] Le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) a \u00e9tabli des nouvelles cotisations le 9 ao\u00fbt 2017 et le 30 ao\u00fbt 2017 pour refuser les d\u00e9ductions correspondantes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2013 et 2015, respectivement, au motif que les attributions ne sont pas \u00ab devenue[s] payable[s] \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au cours de l'ann\u00e9e \u00bb tel que l\u2019exige le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR.\n[3] En bref, le ministre soutient que les attributions sont contraires aux dispositions de l'acte de fiducie et sont \u00ab invalides et frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9 absolue \u00bb parce qu'elles sont contraires \u00e0 l'article 1275 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec, R.L.R.Q., ch. CCQ\u20111991 (le \u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb), qui est d'ordre public.\n[4] L'appelante, pour sa part, soutient qu'elle a droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR du seul fait que les attributions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 une contravention quelconque, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie, au C.c.Q., ou \u00e0 d'autres lois provinciales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\n[5] De mani\u00e8re subsidiaire, l \u2019appelante affirme i) qu'elle s'est toujours conform\u00e9e aux exigences de l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. et que m\u00eame si le ministre est de l'avis contraire, il n'a pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour soulever la nullit\u00e9 des attributions, et ii) dans l\u2019alternative, si la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoirs des fiduciaires en faveur de certains b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019acte de fiducie ou \u00e0 l\u2019article 1337 C.c.Q., le ministre n\u2019a pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour soulever la nullit\u00e9.\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, l'appel est accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n[7] La question en litige est de savoir si les attributions de 30 072 000 $ et de 20 250,000 $ faites par les fiduciaires pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2013 et 2015, respectivement, sont invalides et, en cons\u00e9quence, si le refus par le ministre des d\u00e9ductions correspondantes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par l'appelante pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition 2013 et 2015 en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9.\n[8] Pour trancher le litige, la Cour fera l'analyse des questions suivantes :\nQuestion 1 : Est-ce que les montants sont \u00ab devenus payables \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR du seul fait qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 une contravention quelconque, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie, au C.c.Q., ou \u00e0 d'autres lois ?\nQuestion 2 : Est-ce que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard sont devenus fiduciaires de facto, en contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q.?\nQuestion 3 : Si la Cour concluait qu'il y a eu une contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 C.c.Q., qui est d'ordre public, s'agirait-il d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue ou relative?\nIII.

CCQ-1991 (\u00ab C.c.Q.\u00bb)\n1260. La fiducie r\u00e9sulte d'un acte par lequel une personne, le constituant, transf\u00e8re de son patrimoine \u00e0 un autre patrimoine qu'il constitue, des biens qu'il affecte \u00e0 une fin particuli\u00e8re et qu'un fiduciaire s'oblige, par le fait de son acceptation, \u00e0 d\u00e9tenir et \u00e0 administrer.\n1261. Le patrimoine fiduciaire, form\u00e9 des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s en fiducie, constitue un patrimoine d'affectation autonome et distinct de celui du constituant, du fiduciaire ou du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sur lequel aucun d'entre eux n'a de droit r\u00e9el.\n[...]\n1265. L'acceptation de la fiducie dessaisit le constituant des biens, charge le fiduciaire de veiller \u00e0 leur affectation et \u00e0 l'administration du patrimoine fiduciaire et suffit pour rendre certain le droit du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n[...]\n1275. Le constituant ou le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut \u00eatre fiduciaire, mais il doit agir conjointement avec un fiduciaire qui n'est ni constituant ni b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n1276. Le constituant peut d\u00e9signer un ou plusieurs fiduciaires ou pourvoir au mode de leur d\u00e9signation ou de leur remplacement.\n1277. Le tribunal peut, \u00e0 la demande d'un int\u00e9ress\u00e9 et apr\u00e8s un avis donn\u00e9 aux personnes qu'il indique, d\u00e9signer un fiduciaire lorsque le constituant a omis de le d\u00e9signer ou qu'il est impossible de pourvoir \u00e0 la d\u00e9signation ou au remplacement d'un fiduciaire.\nIl peut, lorsque les conditions de l'administration l'exigent, d\u00e9signer un ou plusieurs autres fiduciaires.\n1278. Le fiduciaire a la ma\u00eetrise et l'administration exclusive du patrimoine fiduciaire et les titres relatifs aux biens qui le composent sont \u00e9tablis \u00e0 son nom; il exerce tous les droits aff\u00e9rents au patrimoine et peut prendre toute mesure propre \u00e0 en assurer l'affectation.\nIl agit \u00e0 titre d'administrateur du bien d'autrui charg\u00e9 de la pleine administration.\n[...]\n1287. L'administration de la fiducie est soumise \u00e0 la surveillance du constituant ou de ses h\u00e9ritiers, s'il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, m\u00eame \u00e9ventuel.\nEn outre, dans les cas pr\u00e9vus par la loi, l'administration des fiducies d'utilit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e ou sociale est soumise, suivant leur objet et leur fin, \u00e0 la surveillance des personnes et organismes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par la loi.\n[...]\n1290. Le constituant, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou un autre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 peut, malgr\u00e9 toute stipulation contraire, agir contre le fiduciaire pour le contraindre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses obligations ou \u00e0 faire un acte n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la fiducie, pour lui enjoindre de s'abstenir de tout acte dommageable \u00e0 la fiducie ou pour obtenir sa destitution.\nIl peut aussi attaquer les actes faits par le fiduciaire en fraude du patrimoine fiduciaire ou des droits du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\n1291. Le tribunal peut autoriser le constituant, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou un autre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 agir en justice \u00e0 la place du fiduciaire, lorsque celui-ci, sans motif suffisant, refuse d'agir, n\u00e9glige de le faire ou en est emp\u00each\u00e9.\n[...]\n1337. L'administrateur peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ses fonctions ou se faire repr\u00e9senter par un tiers pour un acte d\u00e9termin\u00e9; toutefois, il ne peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la conduite de l'administration ou l'exercice d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, sauf \u00e0 ses coadministrateurs.\nIl r\u00e9pond de la personne qu'il a choisie, entre autres, lorsqu'il n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire; s'il l'\u00e9tait, il ne r\u00e9pond alors que du soin avec lequel il a choisi cette personne et lui a donn\u00e9 ses instructions.\n[...]\n1416. Tout contrat qui n'est pas conforme aux conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 sa formation peut \u00eatre frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9.\n1417. La nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat est absolue lorsque la condition de formation qu'elle sanctionne s'impose pour la protection de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n1418. La nullit\u00e9 absolue d'un contrat peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par toute personne qui y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel; le tribunal la soul\u00e8ve d'office.\nLe contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue n'est pas susceptible de confirmation.\n1419. La nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat est relative lorsque la condition de formation qu'elle sanctionne s'impose pour la protection d'int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers; il en est ainsi lorsque le consentement des parties ou de l'une d'elles est vici\u00e9.\n1420. La nullit\u00e9 relative d'un contrat ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par la personne en faveur de qui elle est \u00e9tablie ou par son cocontractant, s'il est de bonne foi et en subit un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux; le tribunal ne peut la soulever d'office.\nLe contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 relative est susceptible de confirmation.\n1421. \u00c0 moins que la loi n'indique clairement le caract\u00e8re de la nullit\u00e9, le contrat qui n'est pas conforme aux conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 sa formation est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 n'\u00eatre frapp\u00e9 que de nullit\u00e9 relative.\n1422. Le contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 est r\u00e9put\u00e9 n'avoir jamais exist\u00e9.\nChacune des parties est [...] tenue de restituer \u00e0 l'autre les prestations qu'elle a re\u00e7ues.\n[...]\n1425. Dans l'interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, on doit rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties plut\u00f4t que de s'arr\u00eater au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes utilis\u00e9s.\n1426. On tient compte, dans l'interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, de sa nature, des circonstances dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, de l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9e ou qu'il peut avoir re\u00e7ue, ainsi que des usages.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\nIV. FAITS PERTINENTS\n[10] La fiducie est constitu\u00e9e par acte notari\u00e9 du 22 ao\u00fbt 2002. Il s'agit d'une fiducie discr\u00e9tionnaire et les fiduciaires ont le droit d'ajouter les revenus au capital ou de r\u00e9partir les revenus ou le capital parmi les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires.\n[11] Lucien R\u00e9millard (\u00ab LR \u00bb) est l\u2019un des constituants de la fiducie. Il est b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avec ses s\u0153urs, ses descendants, dont ses fils Maxime R\u00e9millard et Julien R\u00e9millard (\u00ab les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard \u00bb) et une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui ne participe pas au litige. Il est aussi fiduciaire avec deux autres particuliers qui ne sont pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la fiducie.\n[12] L'acte de fiducie stipule qu'il doit y avoir trois fiduciaires et pr\u00e9voit un m\u00e9canisme pour les remplacer en cas de d\u00e9mission ou d'incapacit\u00e9. Les dispositions suivantes pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019acte de fiducie sont pertinentes :\n1.2 Pouvoirs et discr\u00e9tion du fiduciaire\nToute d\u00e9termination que LE FIDUCIAIRE est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer et tout pouvoir et discr\u00e9tion consentis aux FIDUCIAIRES devront \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s par LE FIDUCIAIRE selon ce qu'il consid\u00e8re \u00eatre le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat des B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRES. Ces d\u00e9terminations, pouvoirs et discr\u00e9tion ne pourront en aucun cas \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9s ou r\u00e9vis\u00e9s par les B\u00c9N\u00c9FICIAIRES ou les tribunaux.\n[...]\n2.4.1\nPour fins de pr\u00e9cisions, LE FIDUCIAIRE a totale discr\u00e9tion de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des distributions ou attributions de capital ou de revenus provenant des BIENS EN FIDUCIE ou des revenus de la FIDUCIE.\n[13] Maybach Corporation (\u00ab Maybach \u00bb) est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille qui poss\u00e8de divers actifs dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al, au Qu\u00e9bec, dont des biens immobiliers d\u00e9tenus par ses filiales (ensemble, le \u00ab groupe Maybach \u00bb). Tout juste avant le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode qui fait l'objet du litige, la fiducie, LR et les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, d\u00e9tiennent les actions de Maybach.\n[14] RCI Environnement inc. (\u00ab RCI \u00bb) est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de traitement des d\u00e9chets constitu\u00e9e en 1997 et contr\u00f4l\u00e9e directement ou indirectement par LR. \u00c0 partir de 2010, RCI entreprend des d\u00e9marches pour la vente de ses actifs; ces d\u00e9marches se terminent le 13 juillet 2013. Elle fusionne ensuite avec Maybach le 1er ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[15] La fusion a pour effet de transf\u00e9rer le compte de dividende en capital de RCI \u00e0 Maybach. Le 16 octobre 2013, Maybach d\u00e9clare un dividende en capital de 164 938 366 $ \u00e0 la fiducie. Le m\u00eame jour, la fiducie l'attribue \u00e0 LR alors qu'il est encore fiduciaire. Cette attribution ne fait pas l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige.\n[16] \u00c0 la suite de la vente des actifs de RCI, LR se retire de ses activit\u00e9s et entreprend des d\u00e9marches pour devenir un non-r\u00e9sident du Canada et s'\u00e9tablir \u00e0 la Barbade. L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie qu\u2019il est devenu non-r\u00e9sident du Canada mais la Cour n\u2019est pas saisie de cette question.\n[17] Au moment de proc\u00e9der au rachat des actions de LR et des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, les conseillers de la fiducie et de Maybach constatent que le groupe Maybach a des pertes en capital inutilis\u00e9es et que le rachat des actions de LR et des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard mettrait la d\u00e9duction future de ces pertes en p\u00e9ril en raison du changement de contr\u00f4le en faveur de personnes non li\u00e9es agissant \u00e0 titre de fiduciaires.\n[18] Pour contrecarrer cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, les conseillers proposent de conclure une entente dont le but est de permettre l'application du sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 256(7)a)(ii) de la LIR et faire en sorte que Maybach soit indirectement contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s le rachat des actions, par un groupe de personnes li\u00e9es \u00e0 LR, soit les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard.\n[19] Le 15 novembre 2013, une entente intervient entre les fiduciaires et les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard (\u00ab l'entente \u00bb), laquelle stipule notamment ce qui suit :\n2.1 ENGAGEMENT DES FIDUCIAIRES\nLes Fiduciaires s'engagent par la pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 exercer leurs pouvoirs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la Fiducie Historia selon les directives transmises par les Fr\u00e8res et \u00e0 ne prendre aucune d\u00e9cision visant la Fiducie Historia sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement obtenu l'accord des Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard. Les Fiduciaires reconnaissent que cet engagement ne les lib\u00e8re pas de leurs obligations envers la Fiducie Historia et ne constitue pas une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de leurs pouvoirs fiduciaires. Les Fiduciaires continueront d'exercer tous leurs pouvoirs fiduciaires, mais ils devront le faire en ad\u00e9quation avec leur engagement envers les Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard\n2.2 D\u00c9SACCORD\nSi les Fiduciaires ou certains d'entre eux sont en d\u00e9saccord avec les directives re\u00e7ues des Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, ils devront alors remettre leur d\u00e9mission \u00e0 titre de fiduciaires de la Fiducie Historia et seront remplac\u00e9s selon les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'acte constitutif de la Fiducie Historia.\n2.3 INDEMNISATION\nLes Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard indemniseront et tiendront indemne les Fiduciaires contre toute responsabilit\u00e9, co\u00fbt ou d\u00e9pense pour lesquels les Fiduciaires peuvent devenir responsables en agissant selon les directives des Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[20] Le 15 novembre 2013, Maybach rach\u00e8te les actions avec droit de vote de LR de m\u00eame que les actions sans droit de vote des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard. La fiducie devient alors l'unique actionnaire de Maybach. LR d\u00e9missionne comme fiduciaire et est remplac\u00e9 par Julie Brosseau.\n[21] Au moyen de r\u00e9solutions \u00e9crites du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2013 et du 12 d\u00e9cembre 2013, autoris\u00e9es par les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard , la fiducie attribue \u00e0 LR un revenu de dividendes de 30 000 000 $ et un revenu de 72 000 $ respectivement, soit un total de 30 072 000 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2013. Au moment de ces attributions, les fiduciaires en poste sont Jacques Plante, Antonino Porrello et Julie Brosseau.\n[22] Au moyen de r\u00e9solutions \u00e9crites du 29 octobre 2015 et du 27 novembre 2015, autoris\u00e9es par les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard , la fiducie attribue \u00e0 LR un revenu de dividendes de 20 000 000 $ et de 250 000 $ respectivement, soit un total de 20 250 000 $ pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2015. Au moment de ces attributions, les fiduciaires en poste sont Jacques Plante, Antonino Porrello et Tony Fionda.\n[23] Les attributions sont vers\u00e9es le m\u00eame jour directement \u00e0 LR, sous r\u00e9serve de l'imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII de la LIR, soit 15 % des sommes vers\u00e9es.\n[24] La fiducie d\u00e9duit les sommes attribu\u00e9es et pay\u00e9es \u00e0 LR (y compris l'imp\u00f4t de la partie XIII) de ses revenus pour chacune des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition en cause en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR.\n[25] Ces attributions de dividendes de 30 072 000 $ et 20 250 000 $ ainsi que leur d\u00e9duction du revenu de la fiducie pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2013 et 2015, respectivement, font l'objet des cotisations en litige.\nV. T\u00c9MOIGNAGES\n[26] Cinq personnes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de l'appelante, soit Me Charles Gagnon, messieurs Jacques Plante, Antonino Porrello et Tony Fionda, tous fiduciaires de la fiducie, et enfin Maxime R\u00e9millard, l\u2019un des fils de LR et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la fiducie.\nMe Charles Gagnon\n[27] Me Gagnon est avocat et travaille pour le cabinet BCF. Il a donn\u00e9 les conseils pour la planification fiscale menant \u00e0 la vente des actifs de RCI, de Maybach et de leurs filiales, de m\u00eame que la r\u00e9organisation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la distribution du produit de la vente. Il est aussi l'auteur de l'entente.\n[28] Il explique que le plan d'ensemble \u00e9tait de vendre les actifs li\u00e9s aux activit\u00e9s de RCI et de Maybach, de liquider les autres actifs, dont des immeubles \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et ensuite de distribuer le produit de la vente des entreprises \u00e0 LR.\n[29] Peu de temps avant le d\u00e9part de LR pour la Barbade, Me Gagnon apprend qu'il reste des pertes en capital inutilis\u00e9es dans certaines entit\u00e9s du groupe Maybach, alors contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par LR. Pour \u00e9viter que ces pertes ne puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es en raison du changement de contr\u00f4le caus\u00e9 par le retrait de LR \u00e0 titre de fiduciaire et le rachat de ses actions avec droit de vote de Maybach, il propose l'entente du 15 novembre 2013.\n[30] Selon Me Gagnon, en plus d'assurer l'utilisation des pertes, l'entente permet d'atteindre trois objectifs, dont le premier est de permettre \u00e0 la famille R\u00e9millard de conserver un certain contr\u00f4le sur l'ensemble du groupe Maybach.\n[31] Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle permet aux fiduciaires d'obtenir le consentement des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard pour les distributions qui seraient en grande partie vers\u00e9es \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re, pour prot\u00e9ger les fiduciaires de possibles r\u00e9clamations par les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard.\n[32] Troisi\u00e8mement, vu la valeur importante des sommes en question, l'entente permet \u00e0 la famille R\u00e9millard de participer \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions relativement \u00e0 la vente des actifs du groupe Maybach et les distributions de la fiducie.\nJacques Plante\n[33] M. Plante indique qu'il est en quelque sorte \u00ab l'homme de confiance \u00bb de LR depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es et qu'il a occup\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents postes au sein du groupe, dont celui de pr\u00e9sident de Maybach. Il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le chef de file des trois fiduciaires. Il a la charge notamment de choisir un fiduciaire pour combler une vacance et d\u2019assurer le bon fonctionnement de la fiducie.\n[34] Selon ce qu'il a compris des conseillers fiscaux et juridiques, dont Me Gagnon, M. Plante t\u00e9moigne que l'entente accorde un certain contr\u00f4le \u00e0 la famille R\u00e9millard, pour permettre le report des pertes en capital inutilis\u00e9es du groupe Maybach. Cependant, il ajoute que les fiduciaires gardent tous leurs pouvoirs en vertu de l'acte de fiducie.\n[35] Selon lui, l\u2019entente pr\u00e9voit deux possibilit\u00e9s: soit les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard transmettent une directive aux fiduciaires, soit les fiduciaires demandent l'approbation des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision en vue d'effectuer une distribution. Il consid\u00e8re que l'entente offre une certaine protection \u00e0 la famille, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la fiducie ne peut effectuer d'attributions sans l'accord, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard.\n[36] M. Plante pr\u00e9cise que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard n'ont jamais particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la gestion de la fiducie et n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9saccord avec les d\u00e9cisions prises par les fiduciaires. Il affirme que la d\u00e9cision de distribuer les sommes \u00e0 LR venait des fiduciaires, apr\u00e8s consultation des conseillers fiscaux et juridiques.\n[37] M. Plante d\u00e9crit le processus d\u00e9cisionnel qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de l'attribution d'une somme \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire comme suit : i) tout d\u2019abord, il consultait les conseillers fiscaux et juridiques, dont Me Gagnon; ii) ensuite, il communiquait avec les deux autres fiduciaires pour discuter de la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 prendre; iii) enfin, il communiquait avec les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard afin d'obtenir leur approbation et transmettre la lettre de directive qu'on leur demandait de signer en guise de consentement.\n[38] En contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. Plante explique que les lettres sign\u00e9es par les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard \u00e9taient une \u00ab forme de consentement \u00bb et que le mod\u00e8le de lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Me Gagnon et avait servi pour toutes les attributions.\nTony Fionda et Antonino Porrello\n[39] Les deux autres fiduciaires, M. Fionda et M. Porrello, donnent un t\u00e9moignage semblable. Ils confirment que M. Plante consultait d'abord les conseillers juridiques et fiscaux pour la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 prendre et que par la suite il communiquait avec les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard pour expliquer ce qui devait se faire et obtenir leur approbation. C'est seulement par la suite qu'il \u00e9tait question de signer les r\u00e9solutions pour effectuer les attributions. Ils confirment d'ailleurs que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard n'ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'administration ou la gestion de la fiducie.\n[40] M. Fionda indique notamment qu'il est comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9 et a une ma\u00eetrise en finance. Il travaillait \u00e0 la Financi\u00e8re Banque Nationale, au service des fusions et des acquisitions, lorsqu'il a fait la connaissance de LR en 2010 pour discuter de la vente de RCI et de ses filiales. Il confirme que le plan d'ensemble \u00e9tait de liquider les actifs de RCI et de Maybach et ensuite de verser les sommes \u00ab \u00e0 la fiducie familiale \u00bb.\n[41] \u00c0 la suite du d\u00e9part de LR, il restait encore d'autres actifs au sein du groupe Maybach, soit un immeuble situ\u00e9 au 85, rue Saint-Paul, et l'h\u00f4tel Le St James \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. La vente de ces actifs a donn\u00e9 lieu aux attributions dont il est question dans le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nMaxime R\u00e9millard\n[42] Maxime R\u00e9millard explique que M. Plante lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'entente et que celle\u2011ci avait pour but principal de pr\u00e9server les pertes en capital du groupe Maybach.\n[43] Selon sa compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019entente, les fiduciaires devaient obtenir son consentement et celui de son fr\u00e8re avant d'effectuer une attribution, mais qu\u2019il n'a jamais donn\u00e9 de directives aux fiduciaires. Il pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il n'a pas particip\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s de la fiducie et n'a jamais eu acc\u00e8s aux registres comptables, aux \u00e9tats financiers, ou encore aux d\u00e9clarations de revenus.\n[44] Il ajoute que M. Plante communiquait avec lui pour expliquer la d\u00e9cision prise par les fiduciaires avant de faire une attribution, apr\u00e8s quoi il donnait son accord. Il ne remettait pas en question la d\u00e9cision d'attribuer les revenus \u00e0 LR, puisqu'il sait que ce dernier \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'origine de cette richesse.\n[45] Lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, il reconna\u00eet que le 5 janvier 2015, la fiducie a re\u00e7u un dividende en capital de 8 751 903 $ de Maybach et que cette somme lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e par la fiducie le 6 janvier 2015. Il indique que cette somme devait servir \u00e0 rembourser des sommes qu'il devait \u00e0 LR. Il pr\u00e9cise que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel pour cette attribution \u00e9tait le m\u00eame que pour les attributions \u00e0 LR.\n[46] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question hypoth\u00e9tique, il indique que s'il \u00e9tait question d'effectuer une attribution \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre de ses tantes, par exemple, il aurait \u00ab pos\u00e9 des questions \u00bb. Mais il pr\u00e9cise que cette situation ne s'est jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[47] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la Cour est d'avis que les t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles. Ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re directe et sans h\u00e9sitations ni r\u00e9ticences. Leurs t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9s et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredits en contre-interrogatoire.\nVI. ANALYSE DES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\nQUESTION 1 : Est-ce que les montants sont \u00ab devenus payables \u00bb du seul fait qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 une contravention quelconque, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie, au C.c.Q. ou \u00e0 d'autres lois provinciales ou f\u00e9d\u00e9rales?\nTh\u00e8se de l'appelante\n[48] L'appelante affirme que les r\u00e8gles applicables sont extr\u00eamement simples et que la fiducie a le choix de conserver les revenus et de payer elle-m\u00eame l'imp\u00f4t ou de les distribuer \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre de ses b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, auquel cas le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire paie l'imp\u00f4t et la fiducie peut r\u00e9clamer la d\u00e9duction vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR.\n[49] L'appelante pr\u00e9tend que le paragraphe 104(24) de la LIR vient pr\u00e9ciser le sens de l'expression \u00ab devenu payable \u00bb que l\u2019on retrouve au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. Puisque les attributions en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es \u00e0 LR et indiqu\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9claration fiscale de la fiducie (formulaire T3) sous la rubrique \u00ab montants pay\u00e9s ou \u00e0 payer aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires \u00bb, l'appelante soutient qu'elle a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(24) de la LIR et que cela suffit pour donner droit aux d\u00e9ductions r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\n[50] L'appelante rappelle l'importance des principes de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9, de certitude et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, ainsi que le respect du droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction maximale de l'imp\u00f4t reconnus par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Canada c. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 CSC 49 (par. 1). Elle soutient que lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur a pr\u00e9vu certaines conditions pour l'obtention d'un r\u00e9sultat donn\u00e9, un contribuable devrait pouvoir s'appuyer sur ces dispositions pour obtenir le r\u00e9sultat pr\u00e9vu : Hypoth\u00e8ques Trustco Canada c. Canada, 2005 CSC 54, [2005] 2 R.C.S. 601 (par. 11), et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Collins Family Trust, 2022 CSC 26 (par. 25 et 26).\n[51] L'appelante soutient que l'intim\u00e9 ne peut examiner l'administration interne des entit\u00e9s canadiennes pour s'assurer qu'elles respectent int\u00e9gralement les autres lois provinciales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et les ententes contractuelles qui les r\u00e9gissent, car une telle approche serait contraire aux principes reconnus de droit fiscal. Elle soutient qu'elle a droit aux d\u00e9ductions r\u00e9clam\u00e9es \u00ab peu importe qu'elles soient licites ou illicites, morales ou immorales \u00bb : Continental Bank Leasing Corp. c. Canada, [1998] 2 R.C.S. 298 (par. 118), 65302 British Columbia Ltd. c. Canada, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 804 (par. 56), et Qu\u00e9bec (Sous-ministre du Revenu) c. Parent, 2008 QCCA 1476 (par. 47).\n[52] L'appelante s'appuie notamment sur la d\u00e9cision Cooper c. La Reine, [1988] A.C.F. no 931 (QL) (C.F. 1re inst.) (\u00ab Cooper \u00bb) (par. 61), dans laquelle une fiducie testamentaire a pr\u00eat\u00e9 une somme d\u2019argent \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire alors que le testament interdisait une distribution avant l'\u00e2ge de 25 ans. Le ministre a contest\u00e9 la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de la transaction, mais la Cour a conclu que l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de la transaction n'\u00e9tait pas pertinente pour l'\u00e9tablissement de l'obligation fiscale et que le ministre n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la bonne administration de la fiducie, car cette fonction relevait du syst\u00e8me judiciaire provincial, notamment des cours sup\u00e9rieures.\nTh\u00e8se de l'intim\u00e9\n[53] L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR est permise seulement si, en plus d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 ou d'\u00eatre exigible, le montant est \u00ab devenu payable \u00bb, d'o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du ministre en l'esp\u00e8ce. Selon l'intim\u00e9, un montant qui ne peut \u00eatre l\u00e9galement pay\u00e9 n'est pas \u00ab devenu payable \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR, m\u00eame s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bours\u00e9.\n[54] Autrement dit, une somme ne peut \u00eatre \u00ab devenue payable \u00bb que s'il existe [TRADUCTION] \u00ab une obligation l\u00e9gale de verser cette somme \u00bb : The King c. Dominion Engineering Co. Ltd., [1944] S.C.R. 371 (\u00ab Dominion Engineering \u00bb) (page 375), Timagami Financial Services Ltd. c. La Reine, [1981] 2 C.F. 777 (C.F. 1re inst.) (\u00ab Timagami \u00bb) (page 779), et Aceti c. M.R.N., [1992] A.C.I. no 421 (QL).\n[55] L'intim\u00e9 souligne que le paragraphe 104(24) de la LIR ne permet pas de r\u00e9puter qu'une somme est payable puisqu'il \u00e9nonce une pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle \u00ab une somme est r\u00e9put\u00e9e ne pas \u00eatre devenue payable \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb, mais ne comprend pas de pr\u00e9somption voulant qu'une somme soit r\u00e9put\u00e9e devenue payable.\n[56] En fin de compte, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que les attributions en cause sont contraires \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie et \u00e0 l\u2019article 1275 du C.c.Q. et qu'elles sont frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9 absolue. N\u2019\u00e9tant pas l\u00e9galement \u00ab devenues payables \u00bb, elles ne peuvent donc \u00eatre d\u00e9duites en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR.\nAnalyse\n[57] Le paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR permet \u00e0 une fiducie de d\u00e9duire une partie de son \u00ab revenu [...] qui est devenu payable \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au cours de l'ann\u00e9e \u00bb, ou la \u00ab partie [...] qui est devenue \u00e0 payer \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb selon la version de la LIR en vigueur en 2015.\n[58] Le paragraphe 104(24) de la LIR pr\u00e9cise quant \u00e0 lui que la somme vers\u00e9e \u00ab est r\u00e9put\u00e9e ne pas \u00eatre devenue payable \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au cours d'une ann\u00e9e d'imposition \u00e0 moins que \u00bb i) la somme ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e au cours de l'ann\u00e9e ou ii) le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n'e\u00fbt le droit au cours de l'ann\u00e9e d'en exiger le paiement (Herbert (premi\u00e8re fiducie familiale) c. La Reine, 2001 CCI 476, par.6).\n[59] Plus r\u00e9cemment, dans Robillard (Succession) c. La Reine, 2022 CCI 13, le juge Hogan explique ce qui suit :\n[60] L'appelante, dans son avis d'appel, demande une d\u00e9duction en vertu du paragraphe 104(6). Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu'une partie du revenu de la succession \u00ab est devenue \u00e0 payer \u00bb, c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avait le droit d'en exiger le paiement, la succession a droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9duction. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, la somme \u00e9tait payable.\n[60] Cependant, ces d\u00e9cisions ne se prononcent pas sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l'attribution.\n[61] Certes, les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 ne mettent pas en jeu les paragraphes 104(6) ou 104(24) de la LIR, mais ils convergent vers un point commun : une obligation de payer doit exister pour qu'une somme soit \u00ab devenue payable \u00bb.\n[62] Dans l'arr\u00eat Dominion Engineering, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour explique que l'expression [TRADUCTION]. \u00ab devenue payable \u00bb envisage aussi [TRADUCTION] \u00ab une obligation de payer d\u00e9coulant de l'effet juridique du contrat \u00bb (page 375), et dans la d\u00e9cision Timagami, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Cour confirme qu'il doit y avoir \u00ab une obligation de payer \u00bb (page 779).\n[63] Or, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que l'entente est contraire \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q, \u00ab qui est d'ordre public \u00bb, et que les attributions faites en violation de cette disposition sont frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9 absolue pour les besoins du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR. L'article 1422 du C.c.Q. pr\u00e9cise qu'un \u00ab contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 est r\u00e9put\u00e9 n'avoir jamais exist\u00e9 \u00bb et que chacune \u00ab des parties est [...] tenue de restituer \u00e0 l'autre les prestations qu'elle a re\u00e7ues \u00bb.\n[64] Dans Felix & Norton International Inc. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2009 QCCS 919 (F\u00e9lix), des actionnaires cherchaient \u00e0 obtenir \u00ab un jugement d\u00e9claratoire quant \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par le conseil d'administration \u00bb (par. 1). La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a accueilli la requ\u00eate en indiquant ce qui suit :\n[40] En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, ce dont il s'agit ici, ce n'est pas l'application des r\u00e8gles civilistes \u00e0 un litige fiscal, mais l'application du droit civil \u00e0 un acte juridique en vue de conclure \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte. Ce n'est que par incidence que l'annulation de celui\u2011ci a des cons\u00e9quences pour le minist\u00e8re du Revenu : s'il n'y a plus d'acte juridique, les cons\u00e9quences fiscales de l'acte n'existent plus.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[65] De m\u00eame, dans Durocher c. La Reine, 2016 CAF 299 (Durocher), il \u00e9tait question de la nullit\u00e9 d'une option d'achat. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[21] D'entr\u00e9e de jeu, le juge de la CCI a reconnu que c'est la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui poss\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 de l'option d'achat (Motifs, par. 45). N\u00e9anmoins, dans l'exercice de sa comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur un appel d'une cotisation, la Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t (CCI) \u00ab doit tenir compte de la bonne foi des contrats, notamment de la validit\u00e9 d'un contrat et de l'ensemble de ses clauses \u00bb (Motifs, par. 46). Le juge de la CCI a donc proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur la base qu'il pouvait consid\u00e9rer la question entourant la nullit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[...]\n[40] La Couronne remet en question la comp\u00e9tence de la CCI de d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 de l'option d'achat. En d\u00e9cidant du bien-fond\u00e9 de la cotisation, le juge de la CCI s'est dit en droit de consid\u00e9rer si l'option d'achat sur laquelle s'\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9 le ministre pour \u00e9mettre la cotisation \u00e9tait frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 alors m\u00eame qu'aucun tribunal comp\u00e9tent ne s'\u00e9tait prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet.\n[41] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de vider cette question [...] Comme le juge de la CCI l'explique aux paragraphes 45 et 46 de ses motifs, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 constater la nullit\u00e9 de l'option aux seules fins de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 des cotisations sous appel.\n[42] Ainsi donc, le r\u00f4le de la CCI, lorsque confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un argument bas\u00e9 sur la nullit\u00e9 dans le cadre d'un appel en vertu de la LIR, n'est pas assimilable \u00e0 celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui elle a le pouvoir de \u00ab d\u00e9clarer \u00bb la nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat [...]\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[66] En appliquant Durocher, la Cour doit conclure qu'il n'est pas du ressort de cette Cour de \u00ab d\u00e9clarer \u00bb que l\u2019entente ou les r\u00e9solutions sont nulles. En revanche, elle peut constater la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une clause ou de l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019entente, afin d'\u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 des cotisations sous appel.\n[67] En fin de compte, la Cour rejette la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante que les montants sont \u00ab devenus payables \u00bb et peuvent donc \u00eatre d\u00e9duits en vertu du paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR du seul fait qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 une violation \u00e9ventuelle \u00e0 l\u2019acte de fiducie, au C.c.Q. ou \u00e0 d'autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ou provinciales.\nQUESTION 2 : Est-ce que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard sont devenus fiduciaires de facto, en contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q.?\nTh\u00e8se de l'appelante\n[68] L'appelante soutient qu'il n'y a pas eu de violation \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q., puisque les trois fiduciaires ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter l'acte de fiducie, nonobstant l\u2019entente.\n[69] En effet, malgr\u00e9 que la clause 2.1 de l\u2019entente oblige les fiduciaires \u00e0 exercer leurs pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la fiducie \u00ab selon les directives \u00bb des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, en ayant \u00ab pr\u00e9alablement obtenu \u00bb leur accord, cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise aussi que \u00ab cet engagement \u00bb ne lib\u00e8re pas les fiduciaires \u00ab de leurs obligations envers la fiducie \u00bb et \u00ab ne constitue pas une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de leurs pouvoirs fiduciaires. \u00bb\n[70] Ainsi, m\u00eame si les fiduciaires avaient \u00e0 priori l\u2019obligation contractuelle d\u2019obtenir l\u2019accord des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la fiducie, cela ne signifie pas pour autant qu'ils ont abdiqu\u00e9 leurs pleins pouvoirs fiduciaires. Dans les faits, les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient prises \u00e0 l\u2019initiative des fiduciaires, avec le consentement des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, qui autrement ne participaient pas \u00e0 la gestion de la fiducie. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les fiduciaires ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer et \u00e0 administrer la fiducie conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leurs obligations l\u00e9gales imp\u00e9ratives en vertu du C.c.Q.\n[71] L'appelante soutient que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard ne sont pas devenus fiduciaires dans les faits et que le concept de \u00ab fiduciaire de facto \u00bb n'est pas reconnu dans le droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[72] Selon l'appelante, la clause 2.1 de l'entente conf\u00e8re tout simplement un droit de surveillance aux fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, ce qui est explicitement permis par l'article 1287 du C.c.Q.\nTh\u00e8se de l'intim\u00e9\n[73] L'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'il y a contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. parce que l'entente fait en sorte qu'il n'y a plus de fiduciaire ind\u00e9pendant et qu'\u00e0 partir du 15 novembre 2013, les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard sont devenus les seuls fiduciaires dans les faits.\n[74] L'intim\u00e9 ajoute que les trois fiduciaires sont li\u00e9s par l'entente qui stipule \u00e0 la clause 2.1 qu'ils doivent obtenir l'approbation des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard avant de prendre toute d\u00e9cision visant la fiducie. Si les fiduciaires ou certains d\u2019entre eux sont en d\u00e9saccord avec une directive des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, la clause 2.2 stipule qu\u2019ils doivent d\u00e9missionner pour \u00eatre remplac\u00e9s par un autre fiduciaire \u00ab selon les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'acte constitutif de la fiducie \u00bb.\n[75] L'intim\u00e9 indique qu'apr\u00e8s la vente des actifs de Maybach, une \u00ab planification d'ensemble \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place pour la distribution du produit de la vente des actifs \u00e0 LR et que le tout est \u00ab d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d'avance \u00bb, une \u00ab consid\u00e9ration essentielle \u00bb \u00e9tant \u00ab de minimiser les co\u00fbts fiscaux \u00bb. Selon l'intim\u00e9, il y a tr\u00e8s peu \u00ab d'interactions formelles \u00bb entre les trois fiduciaires, et le r\u00f4le des conseillers et des professionnels fiscalistes est fondamental pour donner suite \u00e0 cette \u00ab planification d'ensemble \u00bb. L'intim\u00e9 conclut que l'entente est globalement respect\u00e9e puisque \u00ab les d\u00e9cisions de l'appelante se prennent selon la planification d'ensemble sous le contr\u00f4le de facto des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard \u00bb.\n[76] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que chaque fiduciaire en poste au moment des attributions est \u00ab un t\u00e9moin loyal \u00bb, \u00ab un proche de la famille R\u00e9millard et de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb, ou encore, dans le cas de M. R\u00e9millard, un t\u00e9moin \u00ab \u00e9conomiquement redevable aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la famille. \u00bb L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu'il n'est \u00ab pas cr\u00e9dible \u00bb de penser que les fiduciaires d\u00e9cident d'effectuer une attribution et seulement par la suite obtiennent le consentement des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard, puisque cela serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019entente et que dans les faits, chaque lettre de directive commence avec le passage \u00ab Nous vous demandons \u00bb, et que cette directive est respect\u00e9e par les fiduciaires.\n[77] L'intim\u00e9 ajoute que la position de l'appelante \u00ab est confondante \u00bb, puisqu'elle \u00ab varie selon ses int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb. L'appelante pr\u00e9tend que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard \u00ab n'ont qu'un droit de regard sur les fiduciaires \u00bb dans le pr\u00e9sent litige, mais lorsqu'il s'agit \u00ab de sauvegarder les pertes en capital des entreprises du groupe \u00bb, elle affirme que les fr\u00e8res \u00ab contr\u00f4lent \u00bb la fiducie et donc la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Maybach dont la fiducie est l\u2019unique actionnaire.\n[78] En fin de compte, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'on ne peut interpr\u00e9ter l'entente comme conf\u00e9rant un simple droit de surveillance tel que le pr\u00e9tend l'appelante.\nAnalyse\n[79] Avant de conclure que les clauses 2.1 et 2.2, ou l\u2019entente enti\u00e8re est invalide, la Cour \u00ab doit rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties plut\u00f4t que de s'arr\u00eater au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes utilis\u00e9s \u00bb, tel que dispose l'article 1425 du C.c.Q. La Cour doit aussi tenir compte \u00ab de l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties lui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9e ou qu'[elle] peut avoir re\u00e7ue \u00bb, comme l'indique l'article 1426 du C.c.Q.\n[80] Or, le t\u00e9moignage des trois fiduciaires laisse peu de doute sur le fait qu'il y a eu des consultations avec les experts-conseils avant de proc\u00e9der aux attributions en cause et que c'est seulement apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision des fiduciaires que l'approbation des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue dans tous les cas.\n[81] La Cour accepte aussi le t\u00e9moignage de Maxime R\u00e9millard selon lequel il n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la gestion de la fiducie. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent lors des r\u00e9unions; il n'a pas eu acc\u00e8s aux registres comptables, aux \u00e9tats financiers ou encore aux d\u00e9clarations de revenus.\n[82] Dans l'analyse de cette question, il est \u00e9galement important de noter qu'une r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par les trois fiduciaires pour chacune des attributions en cause vers\u00e9es \u00e0 LR. En vertu de l\u2019article 1337 du C.c.Q, il est interdit aux fiduciaires de faire une \u00ab d\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00bb de leurs pouvoirs et en pratique, les fiduciaires ont continu\u00e9 d'exercer tous leurs pouvoirs fiduciaires de mani\u00e8re conforme au C.c.Q., nonobstant l\u2019entente.\n[83] M\u00eame s'il est possible que les clauses 2.1 et 2.2 de l\u2019entente sont contraires \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie et \u00e0 l\u2019article 1275 du C.c.Q., comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9, la Cour conclut sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve soumise que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard n'ont pas dans les faits agi comme fiduciaires ou \u00ab fiduciaires de facto \u00bb.\n[84] Le t\u00e9moignage de Me Gagnon et de M. Plante laisse peu de doute que le but premier de l'entente est de pr\u00e9server les pertes en capital accumul\u00e9es et d'\u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences d'un changement de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 la suite du rachat des actions de Maybach d\u00e9tenues par LR et ainsi satisfaire au sous-alin\u00e9a 256(7)a)(ii) de la LIR.\n[85] Puisque la fiducie est \u00ab contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \u00bb par trois fiduciaires ind\u00e9pendants, validement nomm\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019acte de fiducie, l'entente avait pour but de faire en sorte que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard fassent partie du \u00ab groupe de personnes qui contr\u00f4le \u00bb et qui \u00ab \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le rachat des actions de LR de Maybach.\n[86] De toute \u00e9vidence, le ministre a accept\u00e9 l\u2019effet voulu de l'entente au niveau du \u00ab groupe de personnes qui contr\u00f4le \u00bb en vertu de la LIR puisque Maybach a pu utiliser les pertes accumul\u00e9es avant le rachat des actions de LR. Cependant, l\u2019entente n\u2019a pas pour autant fait des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard des fiduciaires au sens du C.c.Q., et encore moins les \u00ab seuls fiduciaires \u00bb tels que le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[87] Avec \u00e9gards, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de confondre la notion de contr\u00f4le pr\u00e9vu par la disposition en question de la LIR avec les fonctions d\u2019un fiduciaire en vertu des dispositions du C.c.Q.. Si la Cour doit d\u00e9cider si les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard \u00e9taient fiduciaires, cela doit se faire au regard des dispositions du C.c.Q.\n[88] La Cour est d'avis que l'appelante a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9molir les hypoth\u00e8ses de fait du ministre, soit que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard sont devenus \u00ab \u00e0 la fois b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et fiduciaires de facto de la fiducie \u00bb ou encore que \u00ab les fiduciaires ont abdiqu\u00e9 leur libre arbitre quant aux prises de d\u00e9cisions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exercice de leurs pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires \u00bb en faveur des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard : Hickman Motors Ltd. c. Canada, [1997] 2 R.C.S. 336 (par. 92 \u00e0 95), et House c. Canada, 2011 CAF 234, [2011] 4 R.C.F. F\u20113 (par. 30 et 31)\n[89] La Cour conclut donc sur la base de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve entendue que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard ne sont pas devenus fiduciaires de facto et que dans les faits, il n\u2019y pas eu violation \u00e0 l'article 1275 C.c.Q.\nQUESTION 3 : Si la Cour concluait qu'il y a eu une contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q., qui est d'ordre public, s'agirait-il de nullit\u00e9 absolue ou relative?\n[90] La Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que nonobstant l\u2019entente, il n'y a pas eu dans les faits de contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 du C.c.Q., puisque les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard ne sont pas devenus fiduciaires dans les faits et que les trois fiduciaires ind\u00e9pendants ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer leurs pouvoirs fiduciaires.\n[91] Or, m\u00eame si la Cour venait \u00e0 conclure que l'entente est contraire \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie et aux exigences de l'article 1275 du C.c.Q., qui est d'ordre public, encore faut-il voir s'il s'agit d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue ou d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 relative.\n[92] L'appelante soutient que l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. vise \u00ab la protection d'int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb. D\u00e8s lors, les clauses 2.1 et 2.2 de l\u2019entente qui contreviendraient \u00e0 cette disposition seraient frapp\u00e9es de nullit\u00e9 relative. En vertu de l'article 1420 du C.c.Q., la nullit\u00e9 relative ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, ou par le constituant s'il est de bonne foi et a subi un pr\u00e9judice. La Cour ne peut la soulever d'office.\n[93] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que c'est plut\u00f4t la nullit\u00e9 absolue qui s'applique, puisque l'objet de l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. vise \u00ab la protection de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la nullit\u00e9 absolue peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e par tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, le ministre avait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nAnalyse\n[94] Les dispositions pertinentes portant sur la nullit\u00e9 sont les articles 1417, 1418, 1419 et 1420 du C.c.Q. Notons tout d'abord que l'article 1417 du C.c.Q. dispose que : \u00ab La nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat est absolue lorsque la condition de formation qu'elle sanctionne s'impose pour la protection de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. \u00bb L'article 1419 du C.c.Q. pr\u00e9cise que : \u00ab La nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat est relative lorsque la condition de formation qu'elle sanctionne s'impose pour la protection d'int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb.\n[95] Le type de nullit\u00e9 d'un contrat d\u00e9pend donc de \u00ab la condition de formation \u00bb sanctionn\u00e9e, et notamment si celle-ci a pour but \u00ab la protection de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb ou \u00ab la protection d'int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb. Les commentaires du ministre de la Justice portant sur l'article 1417 du C.c.Q. (Commentaires du ministre de la Justice sur l'article 1417 C.c.Q., 1993), font notamment la distinction entre \u00ab l'ordre public \u00e9conomique de direction \u00bb et \u00ab l'ordre public \u00e9conomique de protection \u00bb :\nCet article d\u00e9finit la nullit\u00e9 absolue, qui s'oppose \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 relative, sur la base du crit\u00e8re qui la caract\u00e9rise en droit actuel : celui de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui s'attache au respect de la condition de formation que la nullit\u00e9 vise \u00e0 sanctionner.\n[...]\nOn a, en effet, d\u00e9cel\u00e9 plusieurs sortes d'ordre public : on reconna\u00eet l'ordre public politique (vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense des institutions essentielles de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 : l'\u00c9tat, la Famille, la Morale) et l'ordre public \u00e9conomique (vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation directe des \u00e9changes de richesses et de services), ce dernier se divisant \u00e0 son tour en l'ordre public \u00e9conomique de direction (pour assurer l'implantation d'une politique d'\u00e9conomie dirig\u00e9e) et l'ordre public \u00e9conomique de protection (pour prot\u00e9ger des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers).\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[96] La Cour doit donc se demander si l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. vise \u00ab l'implantation d'une politique d'\u00e9conomie dirig\u00e9e \u00bb ou bien la protection \u00ab des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb.\n[97] Selon les commentaires du ministre de la Justice (Commentaires du ministre de la Justice sur l'article 1275 C.c.Q., 1993), l'article 1275 vise \u00ab \u00e0 assurer une administration objective \u00bb de la fiducie et d\u2019\u00e9viter \u00ab une division purement artificielle du patrimoine \u00bb qui \u00ab fournirait un moyen ais\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9viter le paiement de certaines obligations \u00bb. Ces commentaires ajoutent aussi ce qui suit :\n[...]\nL\u2019article ne retient pas la possibilit\u00e9 que le constituant ou le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire puisse agir comme fiduciaire unique, car, m\u00eame si, dans nombre de cas, un constituant ou un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut d\u00e9signer un fiduciaire conciliant envers ses propres besoins, lui permettre d\u2019agir favoriserait une division purement artificielle du patrimoine et fournirait un moyen ais\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9viter le paiement de certaines obligations.\nL\u2019article 1275 permet au constituant de participer au fonctionnement de la fiducie \u00e0 laquelle il a donn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9lan premier, et au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019exercer un certain droit de regard dans la prise de d\u00e9cisions qui le concernent, tout en assurant \u00e0 la gestion fiduciaire un minimum d\u2019objectivit\u00e9.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[98] Dans Dor\u00e9 c. Verdun (Ville), [1997] 2 R.C.S. 862 (par. 12 \u00e0 14), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada pr\u00e9cise que les commentaires du ministre de la Justice \u00ab peuvent parfois constituer un \u00e9l\u00e9ment utile pour cerner l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb mais ils \u00ab ne lient pas les tribunaux et leur poids pourra varier, notamment, au regard des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments pouvant aider \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions du Code civil. \u00bb\n[99] Dans Godoy Enriquez c. M.R.N., 2019 CCI 114, le juge Tardif s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur la question de l\u2019ordre public \u00e9conomique de direction qui donne lieu \u00e0 une nullit\u00e9 absolue. Il cite le passage suivant de l'arr\u00eat Fortin c. Chr\u00e9tien, 1998 CanLII 12628, [1998] J.Q. 4010 (QL), de la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec, conf. par 2001 CSC 45, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 500 :\n[53] La d\u00e9cision Fortin c. Chr\u00e9tien, 1998 CanLII 12628 (QCCA) (conf. 2001 CSC 45), fait ces commentaires plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur l'ordre public de direction :\nOn rattache g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l'ordre public politique et moral les lois portant sur l'administration de la justice, les lois sur l'organisation de l'\u00c9tat, les lois administratives et fiscales, les lois d'organisation des corporations professionnelles, les lois p\u00e9nales, les lois du travail, les chartes des droits et libert\u00e9s fondamentales. Les parties ne peuvent faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 ces lois ou s'y soustraire par convention particuli\u00e8re et le contrat qui a pour effet de le faire est frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue. Ainsi, s'il y a exercice ill\u00e9gal de la profession d'architecte, de m\u00e9decin, d'avocat, le contrevenant encourt non seulement une sanction p\u00e9nale, mais le contrat bas\u00e9 sur la violation de la loi est jug\u00e9 nul et ill\u00e9gal.\nSous le titre de l'ordre public \u00e9conomique de direction, la jurisprudence et la doctrine regroupent les textes et arr\u00eats jurisprudentiels qui tentent d'imprimer aux agissements des individus une direction publique, sociale ou \u00e9conomique d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Il s'agit, donc, avant tout de r\u00e8gles pos\u00e9es dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re et de son bon gouvernement et qui s'attachent davantage, mais non exclusivement cependant, \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat collectif.\n[54] L'ordre public de direction vise donc \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger \u00ab l'ensemble des institutions qui constituent la base des r\u00e8gles du jeu de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[Soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[100] Dans la d\u00e9cision Financi\u00e8re Transcapitale inc. c. Fiducie succession Jean-Marc Allaire, 2012 QCCS 5733 (par. 42 et 43) (Financi\u00e8re Transcapitale), la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec conclut que trois fiduciaires, tous b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d'une fiducie, ne pouvaient agir seuls en raison de l'article 1275 du C.c.Q., qui est \u00ab une stipulation d'ordre public \u00bb. En cons\u00e9quence, les garanties donn\u00e9es par la fiducie \u00e9taient nulles \u00ab de nullit\u00e9 absolue \u00bb et \u00ab n'\u00e9taient pas susceptibles de ratification \u00bb.\n[101] Curieusement, la Cour ne s\u2019est pas attard\u00e9e \u00e0 la distinction entre l\u2019ordre public \u00e9conomique de direction et l\u2019ordre public \u00e9conomique de protection avant de conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 absolue plut\u00f4t que d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 relative.\n[102] Dans la d\u00e9cision Syndic de Banville, 2021 QCCS 5176 (Syndic de Banville), le syndic a demand\u00e9 au tribunal de constater l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l'acte de fiducie, qui ne respectait pas les exigences de l'article 1275 C.c.Q. La Cour a indiqu\u00e9 en obiter ce qui suit (par. 80 \u00e0 85) :\n[80] Puisque l'acte de fiducie et l'acte de donation ne comportent pas de vices pouvant affecter leur existence, ceux-ci sont valides, tout comme l'acte d'hypoth\u00e8que de 2011.\n[81] Mais, m\u00eame si un vice avait affect\u00e9 l'acte de fiducie ou l'acte de donation, cela n'aurait pas entra\u00een\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement la nullit\u00e9 absolue de ceux-ci.\n[82] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l'article 1275 C.c.Q., bien que d'ordre public, vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger avant tout les int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et du constituant, tel que le rappelle l'auteur Julien Busque :\n[...] L'article 1275 C.c.Q. vise essentiellement la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et du constituant, permettant notamment le respect des intentions de ce dernier formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte, voire la protection du patrimoine fiduciaire lui\u2011m\u00eame.\n[83] Il s'agit ici d'un ordre public de protection et non de direction. La sanction de nullit\u00e9 ne peut alors \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e que par les parties \u00e0 l'acte et non par le syndic. Le Tribunal se range \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la doctrine cit\u00e9e.\n[84] Rappelons que l'article 1420 C.c.Q. pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nArt. 1420. B\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la nullit\u00e9 La nullit\u00e9 relative d'un contrat ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par la personne en faveur de qui elle est \u00e9tablie ou par son cocontractant, s'il est de bonne foi et en subit un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux; le tribunal ne peut la soulever d'office.\nConfirmation Le contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 relative est susceptible de confirmation.\n[85] Ainsi, m\u00eame si le syndic avait eu raison de soulever les vices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, la nullit\u00e9 absolue des actes n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la sanction.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]\n[103] En citant les propos de l'auteur Julien Busque, \u00e0 savoir que l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. vise \u00ab la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et du constituant \u00bb, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a conclu que l'article 1275 est \u00ab d'un ordre public de protection et non de direction \u00bb. D\u00e8s lors, un contrat fait en violation de cette disposition est sanctionn\u00e9 par une nullit\u00e9 relative, qui \u00ab ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par la personne en faveur de qui elle est \u00e9tablie \u00bb, selon ce qui est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 1420 C.c.Q.\n[104] Les commentaires du ministre de la Justice (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s), soul\u00e8vent le danger \u00ab d\u2019une division purement artificielle du patrimoine \u00bb. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre ce qui a motiv\u00e9 la Cour dans Financi\u00e8re Transcapitale \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer que la sanction d\u2019une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1275 du C.c.Q. est la nullit\u00e9 absolue, puisque dans ce cas, les trois fiduciaires \u00e9taient aussi tous b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. Or, dans cette instance, il y avait trois fiduciaires ind\u00e9pendants qui ont validement sign\u00e9 les r\u00e9solutions pour effectuer les attributions en cause au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire LR; malgr\u00e9 l\u2019entente, les Fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard n\u2019avaient pas dans les faits usurp\u00e9 les pouvoirs des fiduciaires.\n[105] La Cour souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure dans Syndic de Banville et la doctrine cit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui. D'ailleurs, s'il y a un doute quant au \u00ab caract\u00e8re de la nullit\u00e9 \u00bb, l'article 1421 du C.c.Q. dispose que \u00ab le contrat qui n'est pas conforme aux conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 sa formation est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 n'\u00eatre frapp\u00e9 que de nullit\u00e9 relative \u00bb.\n[106] Rappelons aussi que l'article 1287 du C.c.Q. dispose que \u00ab la fiducie est soumise \u00e0 la surveillance du constituant ou de ses h\u00e9ritiers \u00bb, ici, les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard. L'article 1290 du C.c.Q. accorde au constituant, au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou \u00e0 \u00ab un autre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00bb (je souligne) le droit d'agir contre le fiduciaire pour le contraindre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses obligations. Ces dispositions viennent appuyer la th\u00e8se selon laquelle l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. vise \u00ab la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb plut\u00f4t que la protection de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[107] Il en va de m\u00eame pour l'article 1337 du C.c.Q. qui dispose qu'un fiduciaire ne peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, \u00ab sauf \u00e0 ses coadministrateurs \u00bb. La Cour est d\u2019avis que cet article vise encore \u00ab la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers \u00bb.\n[108] Or, l\u2019argument subsidiaire de l\u2019appelante est que si la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation du pouvoir des fiduciaires en faveur des fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 1337 du C.c.Q., il s\u2019agit encore de nullit\u00e9 relative et le ministre n\u2019a toujours pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour la soulever.\n[109] Cependant, la Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que nonobstant l\u2019entente, les fiduciaires ind\u00e9pendants n\u2019ont dans les faits jamais d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires aux fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard. Ils ne faisaient qu\u2019obtenir leur consentement quant \u00e0 leur d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der aux attributions en cause.\n[110] Il reste la question de l'ind\u00e9pendance ou de l'impartialit\u00e9 des fiduciaires en poste. Le ministre pr\u00e9tend que chaque fiduciaire est \u00ab un proche de la famille R\u00e9millard et de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb et sugg\u00e8re qu\u2019aucun n\u2019a l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance requise. Or, l'article 1275 du C.c.Q. exige seulement qu'il y ait au moins un fiduciaire \u00ab qui n'est ni constituant ni b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00bb. Cette disposition ne stipule pas d\u2019exigences quant aux qualit\u00e9s des fiduciaires.\n[111] Dans Brassard c. Brassard, 2009 QCCA 898 (par. 110), la Cour d'appel du Qu\u00e9bec pr\u00e9cise que le choix d'un fiduciaire \u00ab ne reviens de droit qu'\u00e0 une seule personne : le constituant. Seule sa confiance dans le fiduciaire importe. \u00bb D'ailleurs, les commentaires du ministre de la Justice sur l'article 1275 indiquent que le constituant est libre de \u00ab d\u00e9signer un fiduciaire conciliant envers ses propres besoins \u00bb. La Cour doit donc rejeter les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[112] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour doit donc conclure que s'il y a contravention \u00e0 l'article 1275 comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9, il s'agit de nullit\u00e9 relative et le ministre n'avait pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour la soulever.\nVII. CONCLUSION\n[113] Pour conclure, la Cour est d'avis que les fr\u00e8res R\u00e9millard ne sont jamais devenus fiduciaires dans les faits et que les trois fiduciaires n\u2019ont jamais d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires, de sorte que les r\u00e9solutions sont valides. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 1275 du C.c.Q.\n[114] Les attributions sont donc \u00ab devenues payables \u00bb et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 validement pay\u00e9es au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire LR, de telle sorte que l'appelante avait droit \u00e0 la d\u00e9duction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 104(6) de la LIR pour chacune des ann\u00e9es en litige.\n[115] Pour ces motifs, l'appel est accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Ontario, ce 24 jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Guy R.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 24 janvier 2023, lors du proc\u00e8s et en application de l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale)[1] (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), Future Electronics Inc. (\u00ab Future Electronics \u00bb) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance permanente de confidentialit\u00e9. La requ\u00eate initiale visait \u00e0 obtenir la mise sous scell\u00e9 de certains documents consign\u00e9s au dossier de la Cour afin qu'ils soient tenus confidentiels et aussi le caviardage de certains renseignements contenus dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Steven Adams (\u00ab M. Adams \u00bb) et consign\u00e9s dans les notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s afin de les tenir confidentiels.\n[2] Au d\u00e9but du proc\u00e8s, la Cour a rendu oralement une ordonnance int\u00e9rimaire de confidentialit\u00e9. En vertu de cette ordonnance, le contenu entier du dossier de la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sous scell\u00e9 temporairement \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion des actes de proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019ordonnance temporaire est demeur\u00e9e en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour puisse \u00eatre en mesure de rendre une ordonnance permanente, ce qui est fait habituellement pour des raisons pratiques apr\u00e8s la fin du proc\u00e8s. C\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[3] Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2023, dans le cadre d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, Future Electronics a modifi\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate afin d\u2019en r\u00e9duire la port\u00e9e. Selon la requ\u00eate, Future Electronics demandait uniquement que certains renseignements consign\u00e9s dans les notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s provenant du t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams soient tenus confidentiels. La pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate s\u2019est poursuivie lors d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence qui a eu lieu le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[4] Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2023, lors d\u2019une troisi\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, Future Electronics a modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau sa requ\u00eate afin d\u2019en r\u00e9duire \u00e0 nouveau la port\u00e9e. Future Electronics a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de rendre une ordonnance permanente de confidentialit\u00e9 afin que soient tenus confidentiels certains renseignements consign\u00e9s dans les notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s. Ces renseignements sont les suivants :\nLe nom de ses fournisseurs et clients;\nLes renseignements concernant son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires ainsi que ceux concernant ses partenariats commerciaux; et\nLes adresses personnelles de trois t\u00e9moins ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors du proc\u00e8s.[2]\n\u00c0 cette fin, Future Electronics a demand\u00e9 que les extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s dans lesquels ces renseignements sont consign\u00e9s soient caviard\u00e9s.\n[5] Le 21 avril 2023, \u00e0 la demande de la Cour, Future Electronics lui a transmis une copie des extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s dans lesquels les renseignements d\u00e9crits au paragraphe 4 ci-dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s.\n[6] Le 31 ao\u00fbt 2023, la Cour a demand\u00e9 aux parties de lui transmettre des observations \u00e9crites relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. La Cour a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Future Electronics de r\u00e9viser le caviardage des extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises le 21 avril 2023, car celui-ci semblait inad\u00e9quat compte tenu des observations faites le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[7] Le 29 septembre 2023, Future Electronics a transmis \u00e0 la Cour ses observations \u00e9crites. Dans celles-ci, Future Electronics soutient ce qui suit :\n-La question en litige dans l\u2019appel consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la cotisation en mati\u00e8re de TPS du ministre du Revenu national \u00e9tablie relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria du si\u00e8ge social de Future Electronics \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agissait de d\u00e9terminer si les employ\u00e9s recevaient un avantage imposable lorsqu\u2019ils utilisaient la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria;\n-Selon Future Electronics, aucun avantage n'est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 leur utilisation de la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria de son si\u00e8ge social;\n-Le ministre du Revenu national a erron\u00e9ment \u00e9tabli des cotisations de TPS relativement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre un avantage en lien avec la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria pour les motifs suivants;\nL\u2019absence d\u2019un \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 entre les prix des repas offerts \u00e0 la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria et les repas comparables offerts \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria;\nLa position n\u00e9vralgique qu\u2019occupe la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria dans son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et dans son rendement financier. Afin d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure de promouvoir sa th\u00e9orie de la cause, Future Electronics doit mettre en preuve certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux de son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires ainsi que de ses strat\u00e9gies commerciales, incluant le nom de certains fournisseurs et clients. Selon Future Electronics, ces renseignements sont confidentiels. De plus, dans un march\u00e9 international extr\u00eamement comp\u00e9titif, Future Electronics prot\u00e8ge jalousement et l\u00e9gitimement ces renseignements;\nSi ces renseignements \u00e9taient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au public (et donc, accessibles \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9titeurs) dans le cadre du proc\u00e8s, Future Electronics subirait un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux.\n[8] Le 29 septembre 2023, Future Electronics a transmis \u00e0 la Cour une nouvelle copie d\u2019extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s avec le caviardage propos\u00e9.\n[9] Le 6 octobre 2023, Sa Majest\u00e9 Le Roi (\u00ab SMLR \u00bb) a transmis \u00e0 la Cour ses observations \u00e9crites. Dans celles-ci, SMLR soutient ce qui suit :\nDans ses observations \u00e9crites, Future Electronics ne mentionne pas le ou les motifs pour lesquels les adresses personnelles des t\u00e9moins devraient \u00eatre tenues confidentielles;\nFuture Electronics a caviard\u00e9 le nom de l\u2019entreprise pour laquelle un des t\u00e9moins a travaill\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es 1986 et 1987. Future Electronics n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que ce renseignement soit tenu confidentiel dans sa requ\u00eate;\nFuture Electronics n\u2019a pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 le droit applicable en mati\u00e8re d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 relativement aux noms et adresses des t\u00e9moins.\n[10] Le 13 octobre 2023, la Cour a conclu que les observations de Future Electronics faites le 29 septembre 2023 \u00e9taient inad\u00e9quates. La Cour a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Future Electronics de modifier sa requ\u00eate afin de traiter des points suivants :\nLe ou les motifs pour lesquels les adresses personnelles des t\u00e9moins ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 lors du proc\u00e8s devraient \u00eatre tenues confidentielles;\nLe ou les motifs pour lesquels l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de sa requ\u00eate \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que celle-ci porte sur les extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s uniquement;\nDe plus, la Cour a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Future Electronics de lui transmettre une nouvelle copie des extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s avec le caviardage propos\u00e9 afin de tenir compte des directives de la Cour.\n[11] Le 13 novembre 2023, Future Electronics a soumis \u00e0 la Cour une requ\u00eate modifi\u00e9e, de nouvelles observations \u00e9crites ainsi qu\u2019une nouvelle copie des extraits de notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s caviard\u00e9es. Dans sa requ\u00eate, Future Electronics a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 permanente afin que les renseignements suivants soient tenus confidentiels :\nLes noms de ses fournisseurs et clients mentionn\u00e9s lors du proc\u00e8s les 24, 25 et 26 janvier 2023;\nLes renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux de son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et de ses d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques mentionn\u00e9es lors du proc\u00e8s les 24, 25 et 26 janvier 2023.\n[12] Le 24 novembre 2023, SMLR a transmis \u00e0 la Cour de nouvelles observations \u00e9crites. SMLR a fait remarquer que la nouvelle copie des extraits de notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise par Future Electronics incluait certains caviardages ayant trait au nom de l\u2019entreprise pour laquelle un des t\u00e9moins a travaill\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es 1986 et 1987. Le nom de cette m\u00eame entreprise a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9 sans raison \u00e0 un autre endroit dans les notes.\n[13] Le 27 novembre 2023, par suite des observations de SMLR, Future Electronics a inform\u00e9 la Cour qu\u2019elle avait commis une erreur et qu\u2019une version pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente des notes st\u00e9nographiques lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e. Ult\u00e9rieurement, la Cour a re\u00e7u une nouvelle version des notes st\u00e9nographiques caviard\u00e9es qui respectait ses directives.\nII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [14] La question en litige est la suivante :\n-Est-ce que les renseignements d\u00e9crits ci-dessous doivent \u00eatre tenus confidentiels et par cons\u00e9quent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 permanente:\nLes noms des fournisseurs et clients de Future Electronics mentionn\u00e9s lors du proc\u00e8s les 24, 25 et 26 janvier 2023;\nLes renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux du mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et des d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques de Future Electronics mentionn\u00e9es lors du proc\u00e8s les 24, 25 et 26 janvier 2023.\n[15] Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, la Cour devra r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\nEst-ce que rendre ces renseignements publics pose un risque s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important ?\nEst-ce que l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019\u00e9carter un risque s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou aux int\u00e9r\u00eats publics invoqu\u00e9s par Future Electronics \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque ?\nEst-ce que, du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs ?\nIII. DISCUSSION A. Quel est l\u2019article des R\u00e8gles applicable afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019information qu\u2019une partie cherche \u00e0 tenir confidentielle est consign\u00e9e dans les notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s\n[16] Selon l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles, \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate, la Cour peut ordonner qu\u2019une partie d\u2019un document soit trait\u00e9e comme confidentielle. L\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles se lit comme suit :\nOrdonnance de confidentialit\u00e9\n16.1 (1) La Cour peut, sur requ\u00eate, ordonner que tout ou partie d\u2019un document soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme confidentiel au moment de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t et elle en fixe les conditions de reproduction, de destruction et de non-divulgation.\n(2) Dans le cas o\u00f9 la Cour rend une telle ordonnance, une partie ou un avocat inscrit au dossier ne peut avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tout ou partie du document confidentiel qu\u2019aux conditions \u00e9tablies par la Cour quant \u00e0 la reproduction, la destruction et la non-divulgation\n(3) L\u2019ordonnance demeure en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour en d\u00e9cide autrement.\n[17] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans sa requ\u00eate, Future Electronics demande \u00e0 la Cour de rendre une ordonnance permanente de confidentialit\u00e9 afin que certains renseignements consign\u00e9s dans les notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s soient tenus confidentiels. Quoique les notes st\u00e9nographiques sont consign\u00e9es par \u00e9crit, donc dans un document, les renseignements qui font l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate \u00e9manent du t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams.[3] Compte tenu de ce fait, a priori, la Cour est d\u2019avis que l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams n\u2019est pas un document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve lors du proc\u00e8s et que, de l\u2019avis de la Cour, l\u2019article 16.1 vise les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve lors d\u2019un proc\u00e8s.\n[18] Cela dit, l\u2019article 4 des R\u00e8gles dispose qu\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est accord\u00e9 aux juges de cette Cour leur permettant de donner une interpr\u00e9tation large aux R\u00e8gles et de d\u00e9terminer la pratique qu\u2019ils jugent ad\u00e9quate en cas de silence de celles-ci. L\u2019article 4 des R\u00e8gles se lit comme suit :\nInterpr\u00e9tation\n4 (1) Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large afin d\u2019assurer la r\u00e9solution \u00e9quitable sur le fond de chaque instance de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive et la moins on\u00e9reuse.\n(2) En cas de silence des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles, la pratique applicable est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la Cour, soit sur une requ\u00eate sollicitant des directives, soit apr\u00e8s le fait en l\u2019absence d\u2019une telle requ\u00eate.\n[19] Compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 4 des R\u00e8gles, et puisque l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles ne traite pas sp\u00e9cifiquement de la fa\u00e7on d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 relativement aux notes st\u00e9nographiques, la Cour est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle doit \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 16.1 afin de le rendre applicable. La Cour est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la fa\u00e7on la plus simple de combler ce vide proc\u00e9dural.\n[20] La Cour conclut que la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles doit \u00eatre \u00e9largie afin de le rendre applicable aux notes st\u00e9nographiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour conclut que Future Electronics a utilis\u00e9 le bon v\u00e9hicule proc\u00e9dural puisque sa requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en application de l\u2019article 16.1 des R\u00e8gles.\nB. Requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9\n(1) Principe : Les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires sont publiques [21] En principe, le public peut assister aux audiences et consulter les dossiers judiciaires. La presse est elle aussi libre de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir et de commenter le fonctionnement des tribunaux[4]. Afin d\u2019obtenir la permission de passer outre ce principe, une partie doit s\u2019acquitter d\u2019un fardeau de preuve exigeant[5]. L\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux audiences sera interdit seulement si la divulgation de la preuve entra\u00eenerait v\u00e9ritablement un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats importants et que la pr\u00e9servation de la bonne administration de la justice s\u2019en trouverait brim\u00e9e.[6]\n[22] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) c Harkat,[7] la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a dit que le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est une caract\u00e9ristique fondamentale d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique. C\u2019est pourquoi, selon elle, le crit\u00e8re applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est si strict et n\u00e9cessite une r\u00e9elle attention menant \u00e0 un exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de nature d\u00e9licate[8]. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises que le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression, inscrit dans la Constitution.[9]\n[23] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) c Donovan[10], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a dit ce qui suit \u00e0 ce sujet :\nLa publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la garantie constitutionnelle de la libert\u00e9 d'expression, est essentielle au bon fonctionnement de notre d\u00e9mocratie (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada c.

Le pouvoir d'imposer des limites \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires afin de servir d'autres int\u00e9r\u00eats publics est reconnu, mais il doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec mod\u00e9ration et en veillant toujours \u00e0 maintenir la forte pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle la justice doit \u00eatre rendue au vu et au su du public (Dagenais c.

Le test des limites discr\u00e9tionnaires \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires vise \u00e0 maintenir cette pr\u00e9somption tout en offrant suffisamment de souplesse aux tribunaux pour leur permettre de prot\u00e9ger ces autres int\u00e9r\u00eats publics lorsqu'ils entrent en jeu (Mentuck, par. 33).

Si toutefois, comme en l'esp\u00e8ce, la divulgation de renseignements doit entra\u00eener un manquement \u00e0 une entente de non-divulgation, on peut alors parler plus largement de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels. Simplement, si aucun principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n'entre en jeu, il ne peut y avoir d'\" int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important\" pour les besoins de l'analyse. Ou, pour citer le juge Binnie dans F.N. (Re), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 880, 2000 CSC 35, par. 10, la r\u00e8gle de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires ne c\u00e8de le pas que \"dans les cas o\u00f9 le droit du public \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 l'emporte sur le droit du public \u00e0 l'accessibilit\u00e9\" (je souligne).[25]\n[43] Dans un tel cas, selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, on peut alors parler d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels.[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, on peut conclure que la divulgation d\u2019information prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par une entente de non\u2011divulgation est un \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important \u00bb et donc un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.[27]\n[44] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a ajout\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial particulier n\u2019est pas suffisant pour le qualifier d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public important. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, un int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels constituerait un int\u00e9r\u00eat important en raison de son caract\u00e8re public.[28]\n[45] De plus, selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, les tribunaux doivent d\u00e9terminer avec prudence ce qui constitue un \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important \u00bb. Une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 sugg\u00e8re une atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression et que, m\u00eame si la pond\u00e9ration de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial et de la libert\u00e9 d'expression intervient \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l'analyse, les tribunaux doivent avoir pleinement conscience de l'importance fondamentale de la r\u00e8gle de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires.[29]\n[46] Dans la d\u00e9cision Shell Canada Limited c La Reine[30], notre Cour a identifi\u00e9 cinq int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux importants qui sont des int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants et par cons\u00e9quent pouvant \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.[31] Ces int\u00e9r\u00eats sont les suivants :\n-L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels[32];\n-L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection du droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit comme l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre aux \u00ab plaideurs commerciaux de faire valoir leurs droits, sans qu\u2019ils s\u2019exposent eux-m\u00eames au risque r\u00e9el de pr\u00e9judice \u00bb[33];\n-L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019un plaideur, lorsqu\u2019il est tenu, par les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable, de divulguer des renseignements de nature d\u00e9licate et confidentielle, peut maintenir la confidentialit\u00e9 de ces renseignements[34];\n-L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la promotion de la certitude commerciale et \u00e0 la protection des renseignements exclusifs[35]; et\n-L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de la concurrence loyale[36].\n[47] Selon notre Cour, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une liste exhaustive. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants en lien avec des activit\u00e9s commerciales ou entrepreneuriales[37]. De plus, tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans Shell, il existe des similitudes ou un chevauchement entre certains des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux important \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessus[38]. J\u2019ai tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019organiser la discussion en les traitant un par un. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants invoqu\u00e9s par Future Electronics font tous partie de cette \u00e9num\u00e9ration.\n[48] Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la Cour doit donc tout d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer si la divulgation des noms des fournisseurs et des clients de Future Electronics et\/ou des renseignements en lien avec ses strat\u00e9gies commerciales pose un risque s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 un des int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ci-dessus ou \u00e0 un autre int\u00e9r\u00eat public important (car la liste ci-dessus n\u2019est pas exhaustive) qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de prot\u00e9ger dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s commerciales. \u00c0 cette fin, la Cour examinera les int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants invoqu\u00e9s par Future Electronics dans ses observations et d\u00e9terminera si la divulgation des renseignements devant \u00eatre tenus confidentiels selon Future Electronics pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un ou plusieurs d\u2019entre eux.\n(1) Est-ce que la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important ? (a) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels\n[49] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sierra Club, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a dit que la pr\u00e9servation de renseignements confidentiels sera un int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial suffisamment important, et donc un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important, dans certaines circonstances.[39] Les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies comme suit :\n60 (\u2026) Pour l'obtenir, le requ\u00e9rant doit d\u00e9montrer que les renseignements en question ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s comme des renseignements confidentiels et que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, il est raisonnable de penser que leur divulgation risquerait de compromettre ses droits exclusifs, commerciaux et scientifiques : AB Hassle c. Canada (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [1998] A.C.F. no 1850 (QL) (C.F. 1re inst.), par. 29-30. J'ajouterais \u00e0 cela l'exigence propos\u00e9e par le juge Robertson que les renseignements soient \"de nature confidentielle\" en ce qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \"recueillis dans l'expectative raisonnable qu'ils resteront confidentiels\", par opposition \u00e0 \"des faits qu'une partie \u00e0 un litige voudrait garder confidentiels en obtenant le huis clos\" (par. 14).[40]\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, selon ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, afin d\u2019obtenir l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 d\u00e9sir\u00e9e, Future Electronics doit d\u00e9montrer que :\n1-Les noms de ses fournisseurs et de ses clients ainsi que les renseignements concernant ses strat\u00e9gies commerciales ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s et trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels, et qu\u2019ils sont donc de nature confidentielle;\n2-Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, il est raisonnable de penser que leur divulgation risquerait de compromettre ses droits exclusifs et commerciaux.[41]\n[51] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams, les noms des fournisseurs et des clients de Future Electronics, ainsi que les renseignements concernant ses strat\u00e9gies commerciales, ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s et trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels par l\u2019entreprise et par ses employ\u00e9s. Selon M. Adams, il s\u2019agit de renseignements vitaux et centraux \u00e0 son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et ils procurent \u00e0 Future Electronics un avantage concurrentiel. Future Electronics est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre le quatri\u00e8me distributeur de pi\u00e8ces \u00e9lectroniques au monde. Ses comp\u00e9titeurs sont des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s publiques qui s\u2019interrogent sur son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et ils se demandent pourquoi elle r\u00e9ussit si bien. C\u2019est pourquoi Future Electronics, comme soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, porte une attention particuli\u00e8re aux informations pouvant devenir publiques. M. Adams a aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est impossible de savoir si certains fournisseurs et clients sont d\u2019accord pour que leurs liens avec Future Electronics soient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres fournisseurs et clients.\n[52] Selon M. Adams, si ces renseignements devaient devenir publics, Future Electronics pourrait perdre ses droits de franchise avec ses fournisseurs et pourrait lui faire perdre des revenus, ce qui nuirait \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et donc irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux. Dans une telle situation, lorsqu\u2019elle perd une franchise d\u2019un fournisseur, Future Electronics ne peut plus acheter le produit de ce fournisseur. M. Adams a aussi dit qu\u2019il est probable que certains des fournisseurs de Future Electronics fassent affaire avec ses comp\u00e9titeurs \u00e0 qui elle vend leurs produits \u00e0 des prix diff\u00e9rents. Si les noms des fournisseurs \u00e9taient connus, ceci pourrait amener des tiers \u00e0 soulever de questions au sujet de leurs prix de vente, ce qui aurait potentiellement des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur ses relations d\u2019affaires ainsi que sur les prix qu\u2019elle paie pour certains biens, ce qui, par cons\u00e9quent, pourrait avoir un impact sur sa comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et irait de ce fait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux.\n[53] Compte tenu des explications fournies par M. Adams lors de son t\u00e9moignage, la Cour est d\u2019avis que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les renseignements concernant les strat\u00e9gies commerciales de Future Electronics devaient et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels par l\u2019entreprise et ses employ\u00e9s. De plus, il est raisonnable de penser que leur divulgation risquerait de compromettre ses droits exclusifs et commerciaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de renseignements trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels et que M. Adams a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9sentent un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les concurrents de Future Electronics, la Cour conclut que la publicit\u00e9 de ces renseignements pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour cet int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.\n(b) L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection du droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit comme l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre aux \u00ab plaideurs commerciaux \u00bb de faire valoir leurs droits, sans qu\u2019ils s\u2019exposent eux-m\u00eames au risque r\u00e9el de pr\u00e9judice\n[54] Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par Future Electronics comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 risque. Afin de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 celui-ci, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si le fait de ne pas rendre l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 place Future Electronics dans une situation qui la forcerait \u00e0 choisir entre ses obligations et son droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re[42]. Dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 Future Electronics est emp\u00each\u00e9e de mettre en preuve des renseignements en raison, par exemple, d\u2019une entente de non-divulgation conclue avec l\u2019un de ses fournisseurs ou clients \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 ne soit rendue, son droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re, qui est d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, serait forc\u00e9ment atteint.\n[55] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, selon les dires de Future Electronics, le seul risque de pr\u00e9judice tient au fait que, si le nom de ses fournisseurs et clients et les renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux du mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires ne devaient pas \u00eatre gard\u00e9s confidentiels et s\u2019ils devaient donc venir \u00e0 la connaissance de ses concurrents, cela leur donnerait \u00e0 ces derniers un avantage concurrentiel. Compte tenu de ceci et du fait que la protection de la concurrence loyale est elle-m\u00eame sp\u00e9cifiquement un risque commercial important qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9 par les tribunaux comme devant \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9, la Cour consid\u00e9rera les arguments de Future Electronics relativement \u00e0 cet int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important.\n(c) La promotion de la certitude commerciale et la protection des renseignements exclusifs\n[56] Afin de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 cet int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial important, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si la publication des renseignements exposerait leur propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice financier grave. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sierra Club du Canada c Canada (ministre des Finances)[43], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a dit ce qui suit \u00e0 ce sujet :\n12 (\u2026) Il est clair qu'il n'y a pas de facteur aussi clairement accept\u00e9 de tous en l'instance, et donc que le droit gouvernant l'octroi d'ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 doit tenir compte d'une pl\u00e9thore de faits. Toutefois, la t\u00e2che de d\u00e9terminer le cadre analytique applicable en l'instance est grandement simplifi\u00e9e si l'on tient compte du fait que le droit actuel fournit d\u00e9j\u00e0 une exception pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements qui sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme des \"secrets industriels\". Selon les principes \u00e9tablis, les secrets industriels constituent une forme de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui peut \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par une injonction. Pour ce motif, on ne permet pas en droit la divulgation de secrets industriels au cours d'un proc\u00e8s lorsque cela aurait pour effet de rendre sans objet les droits du propri\u00e9taire et l'exposerait \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice financier irr\u00e9parable. Ceci explique pourquoi la jurisprudence porte qu'il y a lieu d'octroyer une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 lorsque [TRADUCTION] \"l'objet m\u00eame de l'action serait annihil\u00e9\" si l'audience ne se tenait pas \u00e0 huis clos.\n13 Bien que la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne porte pas sur des secrets industriels, je ne vois pas pourquoi on ne pourrait pas accorder un traitement similaire aux affaires portant sur des renseignements commerciaux et scientifiques qu'on peut raisonnablement consid\u00e9rer avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis ou recueillis sur une base confidentielle. Dans la plupart des cas, de tels renseignements ont une valeur pour les concurrents de la partie en cause[44]. (\u2026)\n[57] Future Electronics soutient qu\u2019il y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat public commercial important \u00e0 ce que l\u2019identit\u00e9 de personnes tierces, \u00e0 savoir ses fournisseurs et ses clients, ne soit pas divulgu\u00e9e, et ce pour elle-m\u00eame et pour ces derniers.\n[58] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams, les noms des fournisseurs et des clients de Future Electronics ainsi que les renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux de son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et des d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques de Future Electronics sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019entreprise comme des secrets commerciaux. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Adams a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019obtention par des tiers du domaine, tels que des anciens fournisseurs, de la liste des fournisseurs et des clients actuels de Future Electronics pourrait constituer un atout pour eux. Inversement, les fournisseurs et clients actuels de Future Electronics ne souhaitent pas que leur lien d\u2019affaires avec Future Electronics soit connu de tous. C\u2019est pourquoi Future Electronics prot\u00e8ge jalousement ces renseignements confidentiels et exclusifs.\n[59] La Cour conclut que, selon les explications fournies par M. Adams et la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, compte tenu du march\u00e9 dans lequel \u00e9volue Future Electronics, le nom de ses fournisseurs et clients, ainsi que ses strat\u00e9gies commerciales, sont des renseignements commerciaux exclusifs et, par cons\u00e9quent, il est n\u00e9cessaire de les tenir confidentiels.\n(d) La protection de la concurrence loyale\n[60] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la protection du droit au proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 directement invoqu\u00e9 par Future Electronics comme motif au soutient se sa requ\u00eate. Ceci dit, compte tenu du contenu du t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams, la Cour se doit de le prendre en consid\u00e9ration.\n[61] Comme \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Resolve Business Outsourcing Income Fund v Canadian Financial Wellness Group Inc.[45] et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 par notre Cour dans la d\u00e9cision Shell, la concurrence loyale est un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.[46]\n[62] Dans la d\u00e9cision RJG Construction Ltd v Marine Atlantic Inc.[47], la Cour d\u2019appel de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador a conclu que le fait de ne pas accorder l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 aurait pour r\u00e9sultat d\u2019octroyer aux concurrentes d\u2019une partie un avantage commercial, puisqu\u2019ils auraient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des renseignements commerciaux et financiers de nature d\u00e9licate qu\u2019ils pourraient utiliser \u00e0 leur avantage et au d\u00e9triment de la partie :\n27 Failing to grant a confidentiality order in this case would provide an advantage to RJG's competitors by giving them RJG's sensitive commercial and financial information which they could use to their own advantage and to RJG's disadvantage. The open court principle cannot be blind to this reality, and in my view, cannot be permitted to expose a litigant's vulnerability in the absence of good reason. In Sierra Club, the Court stipulated that if a court grants a confidentiality order on the basis of an important commercial interest, the commercial interest cannot merely be specific to the party requesting the order, but must be one which can be expressed in terms of a public interest in confidentiality. As I see it, the public interest at stake in cases like this is the ability of commercial litigants to vindicate their legal rights without exposing themselves to the real risk of harm.\n[63] Il peut donc exister un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important au maintien et \u00e0 la protection de la concurrence au sein d\u2019industries en particulier s\u2019il est important pour l\u2019\u00e9conomie canadienne, comme par exemple pour l\u2019industrie bancaire ou \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique.[48] Compte tenu de l\u2019importance du secteur de la distribution de pi\u00e8ces \u00e9lectroniques pour l\u2019\u00e9conomie canadienne et du fait que Future Electronics est une des plus grandes entreprises au monde dans le domaine de la distribution de pi\u00e8ces \u00e9lectroniques, la Cour est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du maintien de la concurrence au sein de ce secteur.\n[64] En effet, compte tenu des renseignements fournis \u00e0 la Cour, il est logique de conclure que, si le nom des fournisseurs et des clients de Future Electronics ainsi que les renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux du mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et de ses d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques ne devaient pas \u00eatre tenus confidentiels, ses concurrents en prendraient connaissance. Il y a donc un risque s\u00e9rieux que cela leur procurerait un avantage concurrentiel qui irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public important qu\u2019est la concurrence loyale.[49] Par cons\u00e9quent, il y aurait un risque s\u00e9rieux de cr\u00e9er une concurrence d\u00e9loyale au d\u00e9triment de Future Electronics si les renseignements confidentiels en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9taient d\u00e9voil\u00e9s au cours d\u2019une instance judiciaire portant sur une toute autre question. Ainsi, la Cour conclut qu\u2019il y a risque s\u00e9rieux mena\u00e7ant la protection de la concurrence loyale si les renseignements ne sont pas tenus confidentiels.\n(e) Conclusion\n[65] Pour les motifs mentionn\u00e9s aux paragraphes 49 \u00e0 64 ci-dessus, la Cour conclut que, si les noms des fournisseurs et des clients de Future Electronics ainsi que les renseignements concernant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments centraux de son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires et ses d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques mentionn\u00e9s lors du proc\u00e8s les 24, 25 et26 janvier 2023 \u00e9taient rendus publics, il existerait un risque s\u00e9rieux pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants suivants :\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la protection des renseignements confidentiels;\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la promotion de la certitude commerciale et \u00e0 la protection des renseignements exclusifs;\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la protection de la concurrence loyale.\n(2) Est-ce que l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, puisque d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas de l\u2019\u00e9carter ? [66] Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables pouvant \u00eatre mises en place afin d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux que d\u2019accorder l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e. Si une autre mesure raisonnable est possible, l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\n[67] Future Electronics n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat d\u2019autre mesure possible. Future Electronics soutient que le caviardage de certains passages des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s est n\u00e9cessaire et que cette mesure est la plus raisonnable dans les circonstances. Future Electronics soutient que le caviardage de certains passages des notes st\u00e9nographiques porte le moins atteinte au principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que tout membre du public pourra prendre connaissance des notes st\u00e9nographiques caviard\u00e9es et comprendre la nature des questions en litige, la position des parties et les enjeux soulev\u00e9s.\n[68] Compte tenu du peu de renseignements devant \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s, la Cour \u00e9tant dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019identifier une mesure moins contraignante conclut que le caviardage des noms des clients et des fournisseurs de Future Electronics ainsi que des renseignements concernant son mod\u00e8le d\u2019affaires est la mesure la plus appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances. La Cour est d\u2019avis que le caviardage des extraits des notes st\u00e9nographiques du proc\u00e8s ne contreviendra pas \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du litige entre les parties.\n(3) Est-ce que du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs ? [69] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 souhait\u00e9e l\u2019emportent sur ses effets d\u00e9favorables.\n[70] Future Electronics soutient que le public, ses fournisseurs et ses clients ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat r\u00e9el et s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 ce que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 soit accord\u00e9e. Selon Future Electronics, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que les renseignements commerciaux confidentiels soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Selon elle, le caviardage propos\u00e9 lui permet de pleinement faire valoir ses droits devant la Cour en contrepartie d\u2019une atteinte minimale au principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats. Future Electronics soutient qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de faire droit \u00e0 la demande en confidentialit\u00e9 vu l\u2019absence d\u2019une autre mesure raisonnable et vu que, du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[71] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les renseignements que l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger sont accessoires au processus judiciaire et les tenir confidentiels n\u2019emp\u00eachera pas le public de comprendre le litige. En fait, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Adams et selon l\u2019avis de la Cour, les seules personnes qui pourraient avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prendre connaissance de ces renseignements sont les concurrents de Future Electronics pour des motifs qui n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec la question en litige.\n[72] Par cons\u00e9quent, si la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance n\u2019est pas rendue, les effets pr\u00e9judiciables pour Future Electronics d\u00e9crits au paragraphe 71 sont de loin sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la d\u00e9rogation potentielle au principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 le peu de renseignements devant \u00eatre tenus confidentiels, leur caviardage constitue une entrave minime au principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, qui est \u00e0 mon avis plus que raisonnable.\n[73] La Cour conclut que le crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9 est satisfait. Les renseignements que Future Electronics cherche \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger sont accessoires au litige et ne compromettent pas le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, puisque le public aurait tout de m\u00eame acc\u00e8s au dossier de la Cour ainsi qu\u2019aux notes st\u00e9nographiques caviard\u00e9es du proc\u00e8s et serait en mesure de comprendre l\u2019essence du litige malgr\u00e9 le caviardage. Les effets b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur les effets pr\u00e9judiciables. Les renseignements confidentiels sont n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019appel, et Future Electronics risquerait de subir un pr\u00e9judice important quant \u00e0 la sauvegarde de ses secrets commerciaux s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. De ce fait, l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public dans la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est minimale puisque les renseignements confidentiels portent sur une portion limit\u00e9e de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve.\nIV. CONCLUSION [74] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux soulev\u00e9s par Future Electronics en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commercial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la protection des renseignements confidentiels, la promotion de la certitude commerciale et la protection des renseignements exclusifs ainsi que la protection de la concurrence loyale, la Cour estime que Future Electronics a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 un risque s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 plusieurs int\u00e9r\u00eats publics importants. L\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019\u00e9carter un risque s\u00e9rieux pour chacun de ces int\u00e9r\u00eats puisqu\u2019aucune autre mesure raisonnable ne permettrait de les \u00e9carter. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour conclut que l\u2019ordonnance est n\u00e9cessaire afin de prot\u00e9ger ces int\u00e9r\u00eats. Finalement, les avantages d\u2019une telle ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[75] POUR CES MOTIFS, LA COUR ORDONNE CE QUI SUIT :\nACCUEILLE la requ\u00eate Future Electronics afin que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 permanente soit rendue;\nORDONNE que l\u2019ordonnance int\u00e9rimaire de confidentialit\u00e9 soit remplac\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 permanente;\nORDONNE que les notes st\u00e9nographiques originales de l\u2019audience soient conserv\u00e9es au dossier de la Cour, accompagn\u00e9es d\u2019une copie de cette ordonnance, pour n\u2019\u00eatre accessibles qu\u2019\u00e0 la Cour et \u00e0 son personnel, aux parties et \u00e0 leurs procureurs, et \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec;\nORDONNE que la copie des notes st\u00e9nographiques, dont les renseignements d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s par les parties, et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier de la Cour le 14 novembre 2023 pour les journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience des 24 et 26 janvier 2023, et le 27 novembre 2023 pour la journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience du 25 janvier 2023, soit accessible aux personnes autres que celles mentionn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment;\nORDONNE que, si une personne autre que les parties, leurs procureurs et l\u2019Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec mandate un st\u00e9nographe pour produire la transcription st\u00e9nographique de l\u2019audience, les renseignements confidentiels d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A soient caviard\u00e9s par le st\u00e9nographe officiel mandat\u00e9 pour produire la transcription;\nENJOINT au greffier de la Cour et \u00e0 tout st\u00e9nographe officiel de prendre toutes les mesures appropri\u00e9es afin que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance soit respect\u00e9e;\nLE TOUT sans d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 28e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Sylvain Ouimet \u00bb\nJuge Ouimet\nANNEXE A\nNotes st\u00e9nographiques :\nLes lignes 3-4 et 12-15 de la page 86, de m\u00eame que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la cote de cr\u00e9dit de l\u2019appelante que l\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 la ligne 20 de la page 102 des notes st\u00e9nographiques de l\u2019audience tenue le 3 juin 2019.\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 77\nN\u00ba DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-1171(GST)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nFUTURE ELECTRONICS INC.

R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[1] La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Entrep\u00f4t Frigorifique International Inc. (\u00ab Frigo \u00bb) exploite une entreprise de transport et d'entreposage frigorifiques dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al depuis 1995, quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e par son pr\u00e9sident et unique actionnaire, Beno\u00eet Bergeron. Frigo s'est vu refuser des cr\u00e9dits de taxe sur les intrants (les \u00ab CTI \u00bb) pour la TPS qu'elle a vers\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines agences de placement qui lui avaient fourni des travailleurs occasionnels pour charger et d\u00e9charger des conteneurs \u00e0 son entrep\u00f4t au cours de ses p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9claration du 1\u1d49\u02b3 octobre 2010 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2014. Frigo s'est \u00e9galement vu imposer ce qu'on appelle des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour faute lourde pour avoir demand\u00e9 ces CTI.\n[2] La nouvelle cotisation refusant les CTI a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en avril 2018, apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation. Aux termes du paragraphe 298(4) de la Loi sur la taxe d'accise (la \u00ab LTA \u00bb), il incombe donc \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de prouver que Frigo a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou qu'elle a commis quelque fraude en produisant sa demande de CTI. L'intim\u00e9 estime que les factures des agences de placement sont des factures fausses, des factures d'accommodation ou des factures de complaisance, et qu'il y a eu un stratag\u00e8me pour ne pas verser la TPS per\u00e7ue. L'intim\u00e9 estime \u00e9galement que les fournisseurs \u00e9taient des pseudo-agences de placement et n'\u00e9taient pas les v\u00e9ritables fournisseurs des travailleurs en cause, car elles ne disposaient pas des ressources humaines, financi\u00e8res et mat\u00e9rielles n\u00e9cessaires pour effectuer ces fournitures, n'\u00e9taient pas inscrites pour le versement des retenues \u00e0 la source, et n'\u00e9taient pas inscrites \u00e0 la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail du Qu\u00e9bec. L'intim\u00e9 estime que Frigo a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stratag\u00e8me ou qu'elle en a \u00e9t\u00e9 complice, ou qu'elle aurait d\u00fb savoir qu'il y avait un stratag\u00e8me, et il soutient que Frigo a commis une fraude en pr\u00e9sentant les demandes de CTI.\n[3] Le proc\u00e8s a dur\u00e9 cinq jours, et 14 t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. Cinq de ces t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient des v\u00e9rificateurs de l'Agence du revenu du Qu\u00e9bec (l'\u00ab ARQ \u00bb), sept \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s de Frigo, et trois \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s de diff\u00e9rentes agences de placement. Les t\u00e9moins de Frigo comprenaient son pr\u00e9sident et seul actionnaire, son directeur des op\u00e9rations, sa gestionnaire et directrice de l'administration et finances, son directeur des transports (dont les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 Frigo par son entreprise de prestation de services personnels), son comptable, un superviseur et contrema\u00eetre, et un travailleur dont les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par une agence de placement.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, l'appel est accueilli et la nouvelle cotisation en cause est annul\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour n'a pas re\u00e7u suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fiables, cr\u00e9dibles et coh\u00e9rents, directs ou circonstanciels, corrobor\u00e9s ou non, pour conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que Frigo ou l'un de ses employ\u00e9s avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un stratag\u00e8me selon lequel Frigo obtenait ces travailleurs occasionnels d'agences de placement et payait les factures de ces agences de placement, y compris la TPS per\u00e7ue de Frigo pour le compte de l'intim\u00e9, sans que ces fournisseurs ne versent ensuite la TPS comme l'exige la loi, ou que Frigo en avait connaissance ou avait fait preuve d'aveuglement volontaire. La preuve ne permet pas non plus de mettre en cause Frigo dans ces manquements ou de montrer que Frigo disposait de renseignements suffisants sur les agences de placement pour avoir l'obligation de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des enqu\u00eates suppl\u00e9mentaires avant de payer la TPS selon les factures pour les services des travailleurs qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par les agences de placement. Les soup\u00e7ons de l'ARQ quant au r\u00f4le et \u00e0 la connaissance de Frigo au sujet de ces agences de placement peuvent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnables et suffisants pour justifier la v\u00e9rification approfondie d\u00e9crite en d\u00e9tail dans la preuve; cependant, les faits mis en preuve n'\u00e9tablissent pas, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu'on pouvait \u00e9tablir, en 2018, une nouvelle cotisation pour ces p\u00e9riodes de d\u00e9claration de 2010 \u00e0 2014. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 soulever des pr\u00e9occupations importantes quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage du pr\u00e9sident de Frigo ou de ses autres employ\u00e9s.\n[5] Si la nouvelle cotisation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit, les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve \u00e9tabliraient, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l'appelante aurait droit aux CTI demand\u00e9s pour la TPS pay\u00e9e \u00e0 ses fournisseurs conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LTA, m\u00eame si ces fournisseurs n'avaient pas vers\u00e9 au fisc la TPS qu'ils ont per\u00e7ue. Il n'y a pas de preuve suffisante pour justifier les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 285.\nII.

La Reine, 2007 CAF 226, aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 6, que l'acheteur doit se conformer strictement aux exigences obligatoires du paragraphe 169(4) de la LTA et de l'article 3 du R\u00e8glement, selon lesquelles la facture ou la pi\u00e8ce justificative pour la fourniture doit comprendre le nom ou le nom commercial du fournisseur ou de l'interm\u00e9diaire de cette fourniture et le num\u00e9ro d'inscription \u00e0 la TPS valable de cette personne. Si l'acheteur ne le fait pas, il n'a pas droit au CTI pour la fourniture. (Voir \u00e9galement le commentaire de notre Cour aux paragraphes 24 \u00e0 30 et 33 de la d\u00e9cision Comtronic Computer Inc. c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 55, selon lequel le num\u00e9ro d'inscription \u00e0 la TPS fourni doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement attribu\u00e9 au fournisseur ou \u00e0 l'interm\u00e9diaire en cause, c'est \u00e0 dire que la personne qui effectue la fourniture doit \u00eatre l'inscrit \u00e0 la TPS.)\n[8] L'arr\u00eat R. c. Salaison L\u00e9vesque Inc., 2014 CAF 296, portait sur une situation de fait assez semblable : plusieurs agences de placement avaient fourni les services de travailleurs. Le fisc a refus\u00e9 les CTI au motif notamment que les agences de placement n'avaient pas fourni les services, qu'elles n'avaient pas les ressources commerciales pour les fournir, et que l'acheteur, Salaison L\u00e9vesque, n'agissait pas de bonne foi, mais participait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un stratag\u00e8me portant sur de fausses factures ou des factures de complaisance. Le juge Tardif de notre Cour a conclu en faveur de Salaison L\u00e9vesque. Lorsqu'elle a rejet\u00e9 l'appel, la juge Gauthier de la CAF a \u00e9crit ce qui suit, au nom de cette Cour :\n[13] Pour qu'une facture en soit une dite d'accommodation ou de complaisance, il faut que la partie qui la re\u00e7oit soit impliqu\u00e9e dans un stratag\u00e8me quelconque, puisque c'est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment pour se conformer aux demandes ou attentes de celle\u2011ci que l'\u00e9metteur de la facture l'a confectionn\u00e9e (voir un exemple type dans Pro\u2011Poseurs Inc. c. Canada, 2012 CAF 200).\n[14] Devant nous, l'appelante a fait une distinction entre une \u00ab fausse facture \u00bb et une \u00ab facture d'accommodation ou de complaisance \u00bb. Selon moi, l'expression \u00ab fausse facture \u00bb peut effectivement couvrir plusieurs types de situations en plus des factures d'accommodation ou de complaisance. C'est une expression plus large puisqu'elle peut englober des cas o\u00f9 le r\u00e9cipiendaire de la facture n'est pas partie \u00e0 un stratag\u00e8me, mais la facture reste inexacte \u00e0 la connaissance de l'\u00e9metteur pour diverses raisons, par exemple, le nom du fournisseur qui y appara\u00eet ne correspond pas \u00e0 celui \u00e0 qui le num\u00e9ro d'inscription a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 ou la compagnie qui l'\u00e9met n'existe pas dans les faits. Il n'est pas opportun d'en dire plus \u00e0 ce sujet ici puisque souvent la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u00e9passe la fiction et je ne pourrais que donner une liste incompl\u00e8te de sc\u00e9narios possibles.\n[15] Je comprends toutefois de l'argument de l'appelante qu'elle ne pr\u00e9tend plus devant nous que les factures \u00e9taient effectivement des factures d'accommodation ou de complaisance, telles que d\u00e9finies ci-dessus.\n[...]\n[17] Le juge ajoute aussi en obiter plusieurs commentaires sur des questions apparemment soulev\u00e9es par l'appelante dans son argumentation ou dans les rapports des v\u00e9rificateurs (par exemple que Salaison aurait pu v\u00e9rifier aupr\u00e8s de la CSST si les agences se conformaient \u00e0 ses exigences). Ces observations assez g\u00e9n\u00e9rales semblent avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 de la confusion sur ce qu'il avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et surtout sur ce qui est pertinent pour satisfaire aux exigences strictes de la Loi et du R\u00e8glement au sens o\u00f9 l'entendait notre Cour dans Systematix Technology Consultants Inc. c. Canada, 2007 CAF 226. Le R\u00e8glement est clair et la seule v\u00e9ritable question devant le juge dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si Salaison avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des factures d\u00e9crivant le nom du fournisseur du service ou de l'interm\u00e9diaire tel que requis par le R\u00e8glement. Ceci est une question de fait.\n[...]\n[23] N\u00e9anmoins, le juge indique aussi clairement au paragraphe 8 de ses motifs que \u00ab [m]algr\u00e9 certaines incoh\u00e9rences, il incombe \u00e0 l'appelante de d\u00e9montrer que les factures en lien avec les CTI r\u00e9clam\u00e9s respectent les conditions obligatoires prescrites par le [R\u00e8glement] et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, qu'il y a bel et bien eu de v\u00e9ritables transactions commerciales entre elle et les Agences \u00bb. C'est sur cette base que le juge examine ensuite la preuve.\n[...]\n[26] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'une fois les pr\u00e9somptions ou hypoth\u00e8ses du ministre d\u00e9molies, c'est l'appelante qui devait prouver par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa position selon laquelle les noms des fournisseurs ou les interm\u00e9diaires sur les factures n'\u00e9taient pas les bons pour que l'appel de Salaison soit rejet\u00e9 (Hickman, paragraphe 94). Le juge dit bien au paragraphe 54 que la preuve de l'appelante \u00e9tait insuffisante \u2014 elle \u00ab ne passe pas le test de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance \u00bb.\n[...]\n[34] Salaison n'a pas contest\u00e9 que les motifs contenaient certaines erreurs, elle s'est content\u00e9 de dire, \u00e0 bon droit selon moi, que ces erreurs ne sont pas dominantes puisque de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettaient au juge de conclure que Salaison s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de son fardeau de d\u00e9molir les pr\u00e9somptions du ministre en pr\u00e9sentant une preuve prima facie et que l'appelante n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve que ces services n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus par les fournisseurs dont les noms apparaissaient sur les factures. Je suis d'accord.\nIII. Faits et preuve\n[9] Frigo exploite un important entrep\u00f4t de produits alimentaires surgel\u00e9s. Ses recettes brutes pour les ann\u00e9es en question \u00e9taient d'environ sept millions de dollars par ann\u00e9e. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Frigo comptait environ 50 employ\u00e9s qui occupaient des postes d'administration, de logistique, d'exploitation et de supervision, ainsi que des conducteurs de chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateur. Des employ\u00e9s travaillaient \u00e0 son entrep\u00f4t 24 heures sur 24, cinq jours par semaine. Frigo avait 25 remorques qu'elle utilisait pour transporter les produits de ses clients en provenance et \u00e0 destination de son entrep\u00f4t selon les besoins.\n[10] En plus de ses employ\u00e9s, depuis ses d\u00e9buts, Frigo embauchait des employ\u00e9s occasionnels elle\u2011m\u00eame ou par l'entremise d'agences de placement. Ces travailleurs devaient charger et d\u00e9charger les conteneurs qui arrivaient \u00e0 l'entrep\u00f4t et qui en partaient, selon les besoins. Au cours des ann\u00e9es en question, tous ces employ\u00e9s d'entrep\u00f4t ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 Frigo par des agences de placement. Au fil des ans, Frigo a eu recours \u00e0 un grand nombre d'agences de placement de travailleurs occasionnels ou temporaires; seuls les services des cinq agences en cause lui ont caus\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations.\n[11] Le pr\u00e9sident de Frigo, M. Bergeron, ne s'occupait pas beaucoup de l'op\u00e9ration de l'entrep\u00f4t, sauf pour r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires et aux pr\u00e9occupations des clients. Au cours des ann\u00e9es en question, le directeur des transports de Frigo, Alain Bussi\u00e8re, fournissait ses services au moyen de son entreprise de prestation de services personnels[1]. M. Bussi\u00e8re \u00e9tait responsable de la logistique des transports de l'entrep\u00f4t, organisait l'horaire et l'ordre de chargement et de d\u00e9chargement des remorques par les travailleurs, et coordonnait ce travail et cet horaire avec le directeur des op\u00e9rations et le contrema\u00eetre ou le superviseur de l'entrep\u00f4t. Le directeur des op\u00e9rations et le contrema\u00eetre devaient pr\u00e9voir le nombre de conteneurs \u00e0 charger et \u00e0 d\u00e9charger chaque jour et informaient M. Bussi\u00e8re du nombre de travailleurs requis chaque jour. M. Bussi\u00e8re prenait des dispositions avec des agences de placement pour avoir le nombre n\u00e9cessaire de travailleurs.\n[12] Rien n'indique que les travailleurs ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et n'ont pas fait le travail n\u00e9cessaire pour Frigo. Le travail accompli par ces travailleurs \u00e9tait manifestement essentiel et vital pour l'entreprise de Frigo, chaque jour et sans interruption. Frigo ne s'est pas vu refuser de d\u00e9duction pour ce travail ou pour ces services dans le calcul de son revenu imposable.\n[13] L'intim\u00e9 n'a pu d\u00e9signer aucune personne autre que ces agences qui aurait embauch\u00e9 ou pay\u00e9 ces travailleurs. Il n'y a absolument aucune preuve qui laisse penser que Frigo ou toute autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a embauch\u00e9 ou pay\u00e9 ces travailleurs, ou que ces derniers \u00e9taient des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants travaillant \u00e0 leur propre compte.\n[14] Je n'ai pas besoin de d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on concluante qui \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire et exploitant de ces agences de placement, m\u00eame si cela serait utile. Il me suffit de d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tendue des r\u00f4les, de la participation et des connaissances de Frigo, de son pr\u00e9sident et des autres employ\u00e9s. Je ne peux le faire qu'en me fondant sur la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. La preuve permet de conclure qu'il est plus probable qu'improbable que ces agences de placement ont fourni ces travailleurs \u00e0 Frigo et que M. Bussi\u00e8re dirigeait ces agences \u00e0 titre personnel.\n[15] M. Bergeron, le pr\u00e9sident, et Sherry Hay, la directrice de l'administration et des finances de Frigo, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait mis en place une proc\u00e9dure pour v\u00e9rifier que les nouveaux fournisseurs figuraient au registre provincial des entreprises et avaient des num\u00e9ros d'inscription valides pour la TPS et l'imp\u00f4t provincial. Mme Hay \u00e9tait responsable de la comptabilit\u00e9 et de la tenue de livres, des comptes cr\u00e9diteurs et d\u00e9biteurs, des employ\u00e9s et de la paie. Au cours des ann\u00e9es en question, ces v\u00e9rifications \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es pour les agences de placement comme pour tous les autres fournisseurs. Elle a dit que son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait en fait d'\u00eatre le bras droit de M. Bergeron et que la proc\u00e9dure de v\u00e9rification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place \u00e0 la demande de ce dernier. Mme Hay recevait les factures des agences de placement directement de M. Bussi\u00e8re. Elle d\u00e9crivait ces agences comme les agences de M. Bussi\u00e8re. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que M. Bussi\u00e8re ne figurait pas sur la feuille de paie de Frigo. Elle a dit que M. Bergeron n'\u00e9tait sur place que trois jours par semaine en moyenne. Mme Hay a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e sur ces questions. Je n'ai aucune raison de douter de sa fiabilit\u00e9 ou de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[16] M. Bergeron a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Bussi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sur le champ en 2018 le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 Frigo a appris du fisc la situation fiscale des agences de placement. Il a dit que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait selon sa directive expresse. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bussi\u00e8re de l'une ou l'autre de ces agences. Le fisc avait fait une v\u00e9rification approfondie. M. Bergeron a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9. La Cour n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de fond mettant en doute sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[17] Luc Cl\u00e9roux \u00e9tait le directeur des op\u00e9rations de Frigo en 2013, apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 avec M. Bergeron pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. Il croyait comprendre que les liens avec les agences avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis par M. Bussi\u00e8re. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que lui\u2011m\u00eame et le contrema\u00eetre de l'entrep\u00f4t planifiaient le transport quotidien en provenance et \u00e0 destination de l'entrep\u00f4t et que M. Bussi\u00e8re \u00e9tait inform\u00e9 du nombre de travailleurs n\u00e9cessaires chaque jour. Cela a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par Pierre Liboiron, le superviseur ou contrema\u00eetre, qui a affirm\u00e9 dire ces renseignements \u00e0 M. Bussi\u00e8re en personne ou par texto. M. Cl\u00e9roux a confirm\u00e9 avoir cong\u00e9di\u00e9 M. Bussi\u00e8re selon les directives de M. Bergeron le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 Frigo a pris connaissance des probl\u00e8mes fiscaux des agences de placement.\n[18] M. Cl\u00e9roux a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire qu'il ne se souvenait pas des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 des questions pr\u00e9cises au sujet de rencontres, de conversations ou de demandes de documents. Vu les circonstances, ces oublis n'ont pas d'effet sur mon \u00e9valuation de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits il y a dix ans ou plus. Le manque de souvenirs clairs des participants est justement l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles il y a des p\u00e9riodes de prescription.\n[19] L'intim\u00e9 n'a obtenu aucune preuve utile de MM. Bergeron, Cl\u00e9roux ou Liboiron ou de Mme Hay pour \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que Frigo avait fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou qu'elle avait commis quelque fraude, de sorte qu'on pouvait \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas non plus r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 mettre en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de ces t\u00e9moins. Leurs souvenirs limit\u00e9s des d\u00e9tails des arrangements et des transactions correspondaient \u00e0 leur r\u00f4le pr\u00e9cis dans cette entreprise pr\u00e9cise de 2011 \u00e0 2014. Cela est compr\u00e9hensible, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'ARQ avait pos\u00e9 certaines questions \u00e0 Frigo, mais qu'elle n'avait soulev\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes qu'en 2018. C'est l'une des raisons pour lesquelles nos syst\u00e8mes gouvernementaux et judiciaires pr\u00e9voient des d\u00e9lais de prescription. Les connaissances de ces t\u00e9moins quant aux diff\u00e9rents aspects importants de l'entreprise de Frigo correspondaient clairement au poste et aux t\u00e2ches de chacun.\n[20] M. Bussi\u00e8re a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Il a confirm\u00e9 que MM. Cl\u00e9roux et Liboiron lui indiquaient chaque jour combien de travailleurs \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires le lendemain. Il a confirm\u00e9 avoir trouv\u00e9 des agences de placement pour des travailleurs aupr\u00e8s de ses contacts et de personnes qui travaillaient pour Frigo. Une des agences lui avait remis des ch\u00e8ques qui lui \u00e9taient payables, mais il ne savait pas pourquoi ni \u00e0 quelle fin, et il a dit qu'il a d\u00fb avoir fait des achats pour elle. Il y avait aussi d'autres ch\u00e8ques payables \u00e0 M. Bussi\u00e8re qu'il n'a pu expliquer convenablement.\n[21] M. Bussi\u00e8re a reconnu que M. Cl\u00e9roux l'avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 et que cela aurait pu \u00eatre en 2018. Il a dit qu'il n'avait pas vraiment obtenu de raison et, lorsque la question lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e de nouveau, il a dit qu'il n'avait pas eu d'explication.\n[22] Le seul travailleur qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 a dit que M. Bussi\u00e8re :\nl'avait embauch\u00e9;\n\u00e9tablissait son horaire de travail;\nle payait;\n\u00e9tait celui avec qui il communiquait lorsqu'il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler.\nIl n'a pas pu dire quelle \u00e9tait l'agence de placement pour laquelle il travaillait ou qui le payait, mais simplement que c'\u00e9tait M. Bussi\u00e8re. Il ne parlait pas de M. Bussi\u00e8re comme repr\u00e9sentant de Frigo, mais simplement de M. Bussi\u00e8re lui\u2011m\u00eame. Il ne connaissait ni ne reconnaissait le nom des agences de placement, ni celui des personnes qui repr\u00e9sentaient ces agences selon leurs dossiers commerciaux d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve.\n[23] Le beau-fr\u00e8re de M. Bussi\u00e8re a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait auparavant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'une des agences de placement de M. Bussi\u00e8re. Ils \u00e9taient des associ\u00e9s \u00e9gaux, mais le beau-fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait l'associ\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, alors que M. Bussi\u00e8re \u00e9tait l'associ\u00e9 non d\u00e9clar\u00e9, bien qu'il dirige\u00e2t en fait les activit\u00e9s. Le t\u00e9moin a trouv\u00e9 que l'entreprise fonctionnait dans le brouillard, que rien n'\u00e9tait clair, qu'il n'y avait pas de dossiers et que M. Bussi\u00e8re lui avait racont\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes choses \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait trop beau pour \u00eatre vrai; il a cess\u00e9 d'y prendre part et a retir\u00e9 son investissement de 15 000 $.\n[24] L'intim\u00e9 a assign\u00e9 le comptable de l'une des agences de placement et lui a demand\u00e9 d'apporter tous les documents pertinents. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s 11 ans et demi, il n'a pu trouver aucun document. Encore une fois, la Cour souligne que la perte de dossiers est une autre raison pour laquelle il existe des d\u00e9lais de prescription. Ce t\u00e9moin a dit n'avoir rien \u00e0 faire avec Frigo et ne conna\u00eetre ni M. Bergeron ni Pierre Liboiron. Il a dit qu'il n'avait aucun lien avec M. Bussi\u00e8re et qu'il n'\u00e9tait ni son commis-comptable ni son comptable. Il a reconnu avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Bussi\u00e8re \u00e0 quelques reprises, puisque son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait conducteur pour Frigo alors que M. Bussi\u00e8re \u00e9tait r\u00e9partiteur. En contre-interrogatoire, il a reconnu avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Bussi\u00e8re chez Frigo quatre ou cinq fois.\n[25] La Cour a \u00e9galement entendu d'autres t\u00e9moins li\u00e9s aux agences de placement, du moins selon leurs dossiers. Vu les circonstances, j'ai d'importantes pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de ces t\u00e9moins et de M. Bussi\u00e8re. Compte tenu de mon \u00e9valuation selon laquelle M. Bussi\u00e8re dirigeait personnellement les agences de placement, ces autres personnes soit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dup\u00e9es par M. Bussi\u00e8re pour participer au stratag\u00e8me des agences de placement, soit \u00e9taient des participants volontaires. Quoi qu'il en soit, aucun d'eux n'a indiqu\u00e9 que Frigo, M. Bergeron ou tout autre employ\u00e9 de Frigo participait aux activit\u00e9s des agences de placement.\n[26] L'un des v\u00e9rificateurs de l'ARQ a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'on lui avait confi\u00e9 le dossier de Frigo en 2013 afin qu'il v\u00e9rifie ses fournitures et ses CTI. Il a reconnu en contre\u2011interrogatoire qu'il avait des doutes et qu'il croyait qu'il s'agissait peut-\u00eatre de factures fausses et que sa v\u00e9rification n'avait pas dissip\u00e9 ses doutes. L'une des agences de placement avait fait l'objet d'une v\u00e9rification de l'ARQ \u00e0 partir de 2010, et le rapport de v\u00e9rification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 en 2012. Encore une fois, on n'a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour aucune explication quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle les manquements fiscaux de l'agence de placement n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 l'attention de Frigo d'une fa\u00e7on quelconque et quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle son inscription n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue. Cependant, quatre ans plus tard, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en fait de percevoir de Frigo la somme non remise en refusant ses CTI pour la TPS pay\u00e9e selon les factures de ces agences de placement, bien qu'on ne conteste pas que les agences de placement demeuraient inscrites \u00e0 la TPS et avaient les noms et les num\u00e9ros d'inscription figurant sur les factures remises \u00e0 Frigo et pay\u00e9es par celle\u2011ci.\nIV. Analyse et conclusion\n[27] Je ne suis pas en mesure d'\u00e9tablir comment ces agences trouvaient leurs travailleurs, ou si elles ont sous-trait\u00e9 leurs fournitures de travailleurs pour Frigo \u00e0 une autre personne ou entit\u00e9. Frigo commandait des travailleurs de ces agences. Ces agences \u00e9taient inscrites \u00e0 la TPS, elles envoyaient des factures \u00e0 Frigo et elles \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par celle\u2011ci pour les services des travailleurs et la TPS. Je conclus, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, que la seule possibilit\u00e9, si ces agences n'\u00e9taient pas les fournisseurs r\u00e9els de Frigo, est que les agences \u00e9taient des interm\u00e9diaires pour un ou plusieurs autres fournisseurs.\n[28] Je ne suis pas aveugle au sujet de ce qui peut s'\u00eatre pass\u00e9. Toutefois, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas fourni d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui d\u00e9montrent, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l'appelante, son pr\u00e9sident ou un autre employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait au courant des manquements fiscaux de ses fournisseurs inscrits, y participait ou en \u00e9tait complice. Il ne suffit pas qu'il semble s'agir d'un stratag\u00e8me auquel M. Bussi\u00e8re aurait particip\u00e9 ou dont il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant, sans que cela fasse partie de ses t\u00e2ches chez Frigo, bien que Frigo recourait \u00e0 ces agences de placement. M. Bussi\u00e8re n'a jamais port\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 l'attention de Frigo.\n[29] Il n'y a aucune preuve de paiements entre M. Bussi\u00e8re et Frigo ou M. Bergeron.\n[30] Frigo a re\u00e7u des services, a pay\u00e9 les services et la TPS appropri\u00e9e factur\u00e9e par le fournisseur, qui \u00e9tait inscrit \u00e0 la TPS, selon une facture conforme au R\u00e8glement, et a consign\u00e9 le tout dans ses documents comptables et ses d\u00e9clarations fiscales. Frigo avait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 convenablement les enregistrements fiscaux et commerciaux des agences de placement, comme elle le faisait pour tous ses nouveaux fournisseurs et comme l'exige la loi, ce qui comprend l'utilisation des bases de donn\u00e9es que le fisc offre justement \u00e0 ces fins. Rien n'indique que Frigo n'ait pas agi de bonne foi ou qu'elle n'ait pas suivi des pratiques commerciales raisonnables.\n[31] Non seulement Frigo n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue des lacunes relatives \u00e0 la TPS des fournisseurs par M. Bussi\u00e8re ou par toute autre personne en cause, mais en plus le fisc savait parfaitement que les fournisseurs inscrits n'avaient pas vers\u00e9 la TPS per\u00e7ue et n'a pas pos\u00e9 de question \u00e0 l'appelante ou ne l'a pas alert\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 a autoris\u00e9 et m\u00eame oblig\u00e9 ces inscrits en d\u00e9faut \u00e0 continuer de percevoir la TPS en son nom. Le fisc a annul\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises l'inscription d'une agence de placement au cours des p\u00e9riodes en question, et deux fois son inscription a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie. De plus, le fisc n'a aucunement emp\u00each\u00e9 ces inscrits non conformes de continuer \u00e0 utiliser leurs num\u00e9ros d'inscription \u00e0 la TPS, ni n'a affich\u00e9 de mise en garde aux futurs clients \u00e9ventuels sur les syst\u00e8mes accessibles au public que les entreprises doivent utiliser pour v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 des inscriptions des fournisseurs.\n[32] De toute \u00e9vidence, l'ARC et son mandataire, l'ARQ, disposent de solutions syst\u00e9matiques pour lutter contre les stratag\u00e8mes frauduleux relatifs \u00e0 la TPS. Le l\u00e9gislateur peut modifier la loi pour y rem\u00e9dier. D'autres obligations pr\u00e9cises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es et des syst\u00e8mes d'information ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place pour contrer les stratag\u00e8mes de fausses factures.\n[33] Je ne peux interpr\u00e9ter la LTA et le R\u00e8glement comme imposant une obligation non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque entreprise canadienne qui ach\u00e8te des fournitures commerciales de faire preuve d'une diligence raisonnable suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de chacun de ses fournisseurs d\u00fbment inscrit, qui comprendrait, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'examen de l'\u00e9tablissement physique du nouveau fournisseur, de ses ententes avec son personnel, de son intention de faire appel \u00e0 des sous-traitants pour effectuer la fourniture, et plus encore \u2014 le tout sans m\u00eame pouvoir savoir si le fournisseur d\u00fbment inscrit et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 a des arri\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le versement de la TPS per\u00e7ue, des retenues \u00e0 la source des employ\u00e9s ou de la taxe de vente provinciale, ou ne respecte pas par ailleurs ses obligations fiscales. Si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu que ces obligations de v\u00e9rification ou des obligations semblables, ainsi que les risques financiers et les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s connexes, soient impos\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque entreprise canadienne qui ach\u00e8te quoi que ce soit d'une autre entreprise canadienne, je m'attendrais \u00e0 ce que cela soit clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que ce soit en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ou dans des dispositions pr\u00e9cises d\u00e9taill\u00e9es. Le l\u00e9gislateur ne l'a pas fait. La Cour ne sait pas non plus si le l\u00e9gislateur a envisag\u00e9 d'autres moyens de permettre au fisc de s'attaquer \u00e0 ce genre de stratag\u00e8mes d'une mani\u00e8re qui lui permet de percevoir autant que possible la TPS que paient les consommateurs canadiens, tout en r\u00e9duisant au minimum le fardeau impos\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les entreprises canadiennes, que les consommateurs canadiens assumeraient \u00e9galement.\n[34] S'il faut des mesures de v\u00e9rification plus exigeantes quant aux CTI demand\u00e9s au titre de la TPS ou de la TVH per\u00e7ue par les fournisseurs inscrits pour le compte du fisc et selon les exigences de celui-ci, cela revient \u00e0 l'ARC et \u00e0 l'ARQ, et non aux Canadiens qui exercent des activit\u00e9s commerciales. S'il faut imposer aux demandeurs de CTI des obligations juridiques plus strictes \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des taxes non vers\u00e9es par leurs fournisseurs, il appartient au l\u00e9gislateur, et non \u00e0 notre Cour, d'en d\u00e9cider.\n[35] La Cour ne peut faire ce que lui demande l'intim\u00e9 en se fondant sur les faits mis en preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[36] L'appel est accueilli et la cotisation est annul\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 27e jour de mai 2024.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nJuge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 78\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2021-1352(GST)G\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nENTREP\u00d4T FRIGORIFIQUE INTERNATIONAL INC.

Cette derni\u00e8re a pris sa retraite au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2022, sans qu\u2019aucun jugement au m\u00e9rite sur le fond n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans ces appels. Suite au d\u00e9part de la juge pr\u00e9sidente, le juge en chef m\u2019a assign\u00e9 ces dossiers.\n[2] Au cours du mois de janvier 2023, les appelants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019admettre les appels log\u00e9s par les appelants et d\u2019annuler les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre du Revenu national (le \u00ab ministre \u00bb) en vertu de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (LRC (1985), ch. 1 (5e suppl.)

Les parties ont effectivement demand\u00e9 de faire des observations additionnelles. En plus d\u2019avoir examin\u00e9 les observations \u00e9crites des parties, la Cour a entendu les observations des parties les 14 et 15 novembre 2023.\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019audience tenue devant la juge D\u2019Auray, M. Plante, M. Andr\u00e9 Mavrovic, M. Jean-Marc Paquin, M. Richard Ouellette, CPA, et M. Claude Lessard ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les appelants.

NOUVELLES COTISATIONS ET QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\nA. Les appels log\u00e9s par SPE\n[6] Les appels log\u00e9s par SPE concernent les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition se terminant les 31 janvier 2005, 31 janvier 2006, 31 janvier 2007, 31 janvier 2008 et 31 janvier 2009 (\u00ab les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009 \u00bb).\n[7] En vertu des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, le ministre a refus\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses totalisant 1 089 130 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par SPE dans le calcul de son revenu \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9penses d\u2019entreprise en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a).\n[8] Le ministre pr\u00e9tend que SPE a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de fausses d\u00e9penses \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance \u00e0 six soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, soit Apnet, Inc.

De plus, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009 hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation sont valides selon le paragraphe 152(4) et si les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s cotis\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) doivent \u00eatre maintenues.\nB. Les appels log\u00e9s par M. Plante\n[13] Les appels log\u00e9s par M. Plante concernent les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition 2003 \u00e0 2008 (\u00ab les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2008 \u00bb).\n[14] En vertu des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses dans le calcul du revenu de M. Plante relativement au d\u00e9veloppement du Ramjet (d\u00e9fini ci-apr\u00e8s) totalisant 13 128 $ a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, et des montants totalisant 1 526 144 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante \u00e0 titre de paiements indirects en vertu du paragraphe 56(2) pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008, plus particuli\u00e8rement les montants suivants:\ni)Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 : 492 720 $;\nii)Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 : 549 783 $;\niii)Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006 : 178 717 $;\niv)Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2007 : 230 176 $; et\nv)Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2008 : 74 748 $.\n[15] Les montants ainsi ajout\u00e9s aux revenus de M. Plante pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008 repr\u00e9sentent le total des montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance au cours de ces ann\u00e9es et dont le ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction dans le calcul du revenu de SPE.\n[16] De plus, le ministre pr\u00e9tend que M. Plante a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par inattention, n\u00e9gligence ou omission volontaire ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus ou en fournissant des renseignements pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2008, lui permettant ainsi d\u2019\u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation en vertu du paragraphe 152(4).\n[17] Finalement, le ministre a impos\u00e9 des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2008, puisque M. Plante aurait, sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus produites pour ces ann\u00e9es.\n[18] Il s\u2019agit donc pour la Cour de d\u00e9terminer, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, si la d\u00e9pense mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus \u00e9tait d\u00e9ductible dans le calcul du revenu de M. Plante, et pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008, si les montants en question devaient \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s dans le calcul du revenu de M. Plante en vertu du paragraphe 56(2). De plus, la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si les nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2008 hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation sont valides selon le paragraphe 152(4) et si les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s cotis\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 163(2) doivent \u00eatre maintenues.\nIII. TH\u00c8SES DES PARTIES\nA. La th\u00e8se des appelants\n[19] SPE pr\u00e9tend que les frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par le ministre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines dans le but de mettre en march\u00e9 le produit de SPE, soit le progiciel, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, dans un authentique contexte d\u2019exploitation d\u2019entreprise. Selon les appelants, toutes ces d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par SPE afin de gagner du revenu d\u2019entreprise, satisfaisant ainsi les conditions de d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a).\n[20] De plus, aucun montant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des frais de commercialisation, de commissions et de mise en march\u00e9 engag\u00e9s par SPE ne devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 au revenu de M. Plante selon le paragraphe 56(2), puisque ces montants repr\u00e9sentent des d\u00e9penses justifi\u00e9es par les engagements de SPE envers divers agents commerciaux am\u00e9ricains, dans un authentique contexte d\u2019exploitation d\u2019entreprise.\n[21] En effet, selon les appelants, les sommes pay\u00e9es par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines en vertu des conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale appel\u00e9es \u00ab Sales Agency Agreements \u00bb repr\u00e9sentent des sommes vers\u00e9es dans le cadre de vraies op\u00e9rations commerciales, et ne se qualifient pas d\u2019op\u00e9rations \u00ab trompe-l\u2019\u0153il \u00bb. \u00c9galement, les fonds pr\u00eat\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante sont de v\u00e9ritables pr\u00eats constat\u00e9s par billets \u00e0 ordre et ne seraient donc pas assujetties au paragraphe 56(2). Ces op\u00e9rations ne r\u00e9sulteraient pas en un avantage imposable pour M. Plante en vertu du paragraphe 56(2), puisque, selon les appelants, l\u2019existence d\u2019un trompe-l\u2019\u0153il est une condition \u00e0 l\u2019application de ce paragraphe.\n[22] En ce qui concerne l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, M. Plante a admis que la somme de 13 128 $ d\u00e9duite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du d\u00e9veloppement du \u00ab Ramjet Fuel Saver Devices \u00bb (le \u00ab Ramjet \u00bb) n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9claration de revenus qu\u2019il a produite pour cette ann\u00e9e.\n[23] En outre, selon les appelants, le ministre ne pouvait \u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, puisqu\u2019en l\u2019absence de d\u00e9lai sp\u00e9cifique en vertu du paragraphe 152(4), c\u2019est la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif (LRC 1985, ch. C-50) (\u00ab Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb) qui s\u2019applique, et qui renvoie aux dispositions du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (RLRQ c. CCQ-1991) (le \u00ab C.c.Q. \u00bb). Ainsi, le d\u00e9lai de prescription de trois ans pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 2925 C.c.Q. emp\u00eacherait donc l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles cotisations plus de trois ans apr\u00e8s que le ministre a pris connaissance des faits justifiant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations.\n[24] Finalement, les appelants soutiennent que puisque SPE et M. Plante \u00e9taient de bonne foi, l\u2019imposition des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 163(2) n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e.\nB. La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que SPE a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de fausses d\u00e9penses \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour la mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[26] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines sont de pr\u00e9tendues soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 et sont toutes inactives. Ainsi, ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019ont pu rendre aucun service \u00e0 SPE. SPE n\u2019aurait fourni aucune preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e9tayant sa position. SPE ne pouvait donc pas d\u00e9duire ces d\u00e9penses dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a), puisqu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es par SPE en vue de tirer un revenu d\u2019entreprise.\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9tend toutefois pas que SPE est un \u00ab trompe-l\u2019\u0153il \u00bb ou que le progiciel est un \u00ab trompe-l\u2019\u0153il \u00bb. En effet, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le progiciel existe et il est clair que SPE elle-m\u00eame existe, exerce des activit\u00e9s, g\u00e9n\u00e8re des revenus provenant de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise, encourt des d\u00e9penses dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise et a engag\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses pour d\u00e9velopper ce progiciel. L\u2019intim\u00e9 admet qu\u2019il y a eu des ventes du progiciel au Qu\u00e9bec et a reconnu que SPE exer\u00e7ait des activit\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis, malgr\u00e9 une seule vente du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis durant les ann\u00e9es en cause. \u00c0 ce titre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 reconnait que M. Mavrovic est all\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour repr\u00e9senter SPE et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, a accept\u00e9 comme d\u00e9penses d\u00e9ductibles dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019entreprise de SPE un montant totalisant environ 350 000 $ pour les honoraires vers\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Mavrovic. De m\u00eame, M. Plante et M. Paquin ont effectu\u00e9 des voyages aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour pr\u00e9senter le progiciel \u00e0 divers clients potentiels.\n[28] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la question est plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer qui exer\u00e7ait les activit\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis, soit SPE (par l\u2019entremise de M. Plante, M. Mavrovic et M. Paquin), ou les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que SPE exer\u00e7ait ces activ\u00e9s, et non pas les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines : les montants pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne pouvaient donc pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es pour ces activit\u00e9s.\n[29] De plus, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, aucune entreprise n\u2019est exploit\u00e9e par les acqu\u00e9reurs de licences de territoires et SPE ne s\u2019est pas occup\u00e9e de la vente du progiciel pour le compte des licenci\u00e9s.\n[30] Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les montants totalisant 1 526 144 $ de son compte bancaire aux comptes bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines suivant les instructions de M. Plante, pour permettre \u00e0 M. Plante de s\u2019approprier ces fonds pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel et d\u2019avantager certaines de ses connaissances. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Plante aurait d\u00fb inclure ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu du paragraphe 15(1) si le paiement de ces montants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait directement par SPE \u00e0 M. Plante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 prend la position que toutes les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 56(2) sont r\u00e9unies. Cons\u00e9quemment, M. Plante devrait ajouter la totalit\u00e9 de ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu.\n[31] \u00c9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que si la Cour conclut que les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par SPE \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 pay\u00e9s d\u2019avance aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour la mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel de SPE aux \u00c9tats-Unis sont de fausses d\u00e9penses, les conditions d\u2019application du sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) et du paragraphe 163(2) sont r\u00e9unies. Ainsi, le ministre serait en droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de SPE pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009, et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Plante pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008, hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation et d\u2019imposer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 163(2).\n[32] Finalement, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, M. Plante a convenu au cours de l\u2019audience qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pay\u00e9 la somme de 13 128 $ concernant le d\u00e9veloppement du Ramjet. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient donc que ce montant n\u2019est pas d\u00e9ductible dans le calcul du revenu de M. Plante. Les conditions d\u2019application du sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) et du paragraphe 163(2) seraient donc \u00e9galement r\u00e9unies pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, permettant au ministre d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation et d\u2019imposer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 163(2).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n[33] Pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s, les appels log\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre pour les ann\u00e9es 2005 \u00e0 2009, et les appels log\u00e9s par M. Plante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des nouvelles cotisations \u00e9tablies par le ministre pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2008 sont rejet\u00e9s, avec un seul m\u00e9moire de d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces d\u00e9pens \u00e9tant calcul\u00e9s selon le tarif B de l\u2019annexe II des R\u00e8gles de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t (proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale).\nV. QUESTION PR\u00c9LIMINAIRE : OBJECTION CONCERNANT LE PRIVIL\u00c8GE RELATIF AU LITIGE\n[34] Lors de l\u2019audition de ces appels au cours des mois d\u2019octobre et de novembre 2017, la juge pr\u00e9sidente a pris en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 une objection soulev\u00e9e par les appelants relativement au d\u00e9p\u00f4t en preuve d\u2019un courriel de M. Mavrovic, dont copie est \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 107 de la pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[35] Cet onglet 107 contient la copie d\u2019un courriel dat\u00e9 du 28 avril 2009 de M. Mavrovic adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Plante, dont l\u2019objet est intitul\u00e9 \u00ab histoire USA version draft \u00bb. \u00c0 ce courriel est joint un document r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines suivantes : Apnet, For Impex, SPE Marketing et A+Shadow. Le document d\u00e9crit entre autres les activit\u00e9s et les actionnaires de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, les entr\u00e9es et sorties de fonds \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chacune des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, la description des pr\u00eats et les termes et modalit\u00e9s de ceux-ci, et contient une tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 \u00e0 2006.\n[36] Selon les appelants, ce courriel ne devrait pas \u00eatre admis en preuve sur la base du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige puisque des projets de cotisation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par le ministre en avril 2009. Les appelants consid\u00e8rent donc qu\u2019il est clair qu\u2019au 28 avril 2009, il y avait un litige appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 par les parties. De plus, selon les appelants, la Cour doit prendre en compte le fait que la question de la structure am\u00e9ricaine est au c\u0153ur m\u00eame du litige. Ainsi, pour ces raisons, l\u2019objection devrait \u00eatre maintenue et la Cour devrait refuser d\u2019admettre en preuve ce courriel.\n[37] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Cour doit rejeter cette objection et permettre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en preuve de ce courriel. L\u2019intim\u00e9 invite \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation stricte du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, qui est distinct du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (voir Lizotte c. Aviva, Compagnie d\u2019assurance du Canada, 2016 CSC 52 [Lizotte], par. 22, citant Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2006 CSC 39 [Blank]). Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le litige ne d\u00e9bute que lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour, soit en 2015. Le 28 avril 2009, \u00e0 la date du courriel, il ne pourrait y avoir de litige appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 puisqu\u2019aucun avis de nouvelle cotisation n\u2019avait encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par le ministre. Le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige ne saurait donc \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour des documents pr\u00e9par\u00e9s avant m\u00eame que le contribuable ne loge un avis d\u2019opposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une nouvelle cotisation. De plus, par lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 avril 2009, l\u2019ARC octroyait \u00e0 SPE la possibilit\u00e9 de lui transmettre des repr\u00e9sentations additionnelles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des projets de cotisation, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Cependant, la preuve est muette quant \u00e0 savoir si de telles repr\u00e9sentations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par les appelants aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ARC. Ainsi, les appelants ne pourraient pr\u00e9tendre que le courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 dans le cadre de repr\u00e9sentations effectu\u00e9es quant aux projets de cotisation. Finalement, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans le cadre d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u2019autocotisation comme le n\u00f4tre, il ne serait pas raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019un litige est appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 d\u00e8s que l\u2019ARC entame une v\u00e9rification, puisque cela reviendrait \u00e0 admettre que les d\u00e9clarations de revenus des contribuables ne sont pas conformes \u00e0 la Loi.\n[38] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour maintient l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e par les appelants; ainsi, ce courriel est exclu de la preuve.\n[39] Le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige n\u2019existe pas seulement pour prot\u00e9ger les communications entre un avocat et son client, mais peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des communications entre un avocat et des tiers et dans le cas de personnes non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, entre celles-ci et des tiers, du moment que l\u2019objet principal de la communication est la pr\u00e9paration du litige (Blank, supra, par. 27 et par. 59 \u00e0 61). Ainsi, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si les conditions d\u2019application du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige sont r\u00e9unies, le courriel de M. Mavrovic adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Plante peut faire l\u2019objet de ce privil\u00e8ge.\n[40] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lizotte (supra, par. 33, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Blank, supra), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que les deux conditions suivantes doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies pour invoquer le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige relativement \u00e0 un document, et que lorsque ces deux conditions sont r\u00e9unies, il y a pr\u00e9somption d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 du document (sauf exception relative \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et autres exceptions de nature criminelle, non applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce):\ni)Le document doit avoir pour objet principal la pr\u00e9paration du litige;\nii)Le litige ou un litige connexe est en cours, ou peut \u00eatre raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9.\n[41] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si un document a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 principalement en vue du litige, il faut examiner l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur du document et celui ayant command\u00e9 la r\u00e9daction de celui-ci, la date de cr\u00e9ation du document, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la personne \u00e0 laquelle le document est adress\u00e9 ainsi que le contenu du document (Burlington Resources Finance Company c. La Reine, 2019 CCI 143, par. 69).\n[42] Le terme \u00ab litige \u00bb vise un litige en instance de m\u00eame qu\u2019un litige qui peut \u00eatre raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 (Blank, supra, par. 38). Un litige sera raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00ab \u2026qu\u2019une personne raisonnable, poss\u00e9dant la m\u00eame connaissance de la situation que l\u2019une des parties ou que les deux, estimerait peu probable que le diff\u00e9rend se r\u00e8gle sans recours aux tribunaux \u00bb (Brass c. Canada, 2012 CF 927, par. 139; la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a accueilli l\u2019appel sur la base de l\u2019application du droit aux faits propres du dossier : voir Premi\u00e8re Nation de Grand Rapids c. Canada, 2014 CAF 201). \u00c9galement, la jurisprudence a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un litige raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 est davantage qu\u2019une simple possibilit\u00e9, mais moins qu\u2019une certitude, et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un test tr\u00e8s exigeant \u00e0 remplir (Hamalainen (Committee of) v. Sippola, [1991] B.C.J. No. 3614 (BCCA), par. 22).\n[43] Dans cette analyse, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab litige \u00bb doit \u00eatre circonscrite par l\u2019objet m\u00eame du privil\u00e8ge, qui est \u00ab \u2026 le besoin d\u2019une zone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faciliter, pour l\u2019avocat, l\u2019enqu\u00eate et la pr\u00e9paration du dossier en vue de l\u2019instruction contradictoire \u00bb (Blank, supra, par. 40).\n[44] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces remarques, pour les raisons suivantes, la Cour conclut qu\u2019au 28 avril 2009, le courriel avait pour objet principal la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un litige raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9.\n[45] Tout d\u2019abord, M. Mavrovic a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ce courriel; la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait la personne ayant mis en place la structure am\u00e9ricaine; ce courriel est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Plante, le principal int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans cette mise en place de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[46] De plus, bien qu\u2019en avril 2009, un litige n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en cours au sens strict du terme (puisque les avis d\u2019appel de SPE et de M. Plante ne seront log\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour qu\u2019en 2015), il est clair que le litige opposant les appelants et les autorit\u00e9s fiscales ne constituait pas seulement une possibilit\u00e9 ou un soup\u00e7on, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9. En effet, une personne raisonnable poss\u00e9dant la m\u00eame connaissance des faits entourant les transferts faits aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines que M. Plante et M. Mavrovic estimerait peu probable que le diff\u00e9rend se r\u00e8gle sans recours aux tribunaux.\n[47] La v\u00e9rification de l\u2019ARC a d\u00e9but\u00e9 vers la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006. En janvier 2007, Mme Drew s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux bureaux de SPE pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification et consulter divers documents. Par la suite, des questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es par Mme Drew quant aux d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par SPE dans le calcul de son revenu au titre des montants vers\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[48] Dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification, Mme Drew a obtenu des copies de quelques factures \u00e9mises par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (deux factures \u00e9mises par Apnet, une facture \u00e9mise par A+Shadow et une facture \u00e9mise par SPE Marketing). Selon Mme Drew, ces factures ne justifiaient pas suffisamment les montants d\u00e9duits par SPE au cours des ann\u00e9es. Aucun compte rendu des d\u00e9marches effectu\u00e9es par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne lui sera remis, bien que Mme Drew en ait fait la demande.\n[49] Le 22 avril 2009, Mme Drew s\u2019est de nouveau pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux bureaux de SPE pour rencontrer Mme Maryse Gosselin (adjointe de M. Plante) et M. Mavrovic, en compagnie de son chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe. Lors de cette rencontre, Mme Drew a pos\u00e9 de plus amples questions sur les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par SPE au titre des sommes vers\u00e9es aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau des copies des comptes rendus produits par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour d\u00e9montrer les d\u00e9marches effectu\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats-Unis, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[50] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 avril 2009, Mme Drew a avis\u00e9 SPE et M. Plante que la v\u00e9rification des d\u00e9clarations de revenus de SPE pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2006 \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e. Par cette m\u00eame lettre, Mme Drew a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 SPE et \u00e0 M. Plante de lui faire parvenir des commentaires quant aux redressements propos\u00e9s, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[51] Ainsi, au 28 avril 2009, lorsque M. Mavrovic a envoy\u00e9 le courriel \u00e0 M. Plante d\u00e9taillant l\u2019historique des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 107), Mme Drew avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9, sans succ\u00e8s, les rapports des activit\u00e9s des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines qui pourraient justifier le d\u00e9marchage effectu\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. \u00c0 cette date, les appelants savaient donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 que la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des montants vers\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e9tait remise en question par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales.\n[52] Vu l\u2019absence de documents justifiant la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des montants vers\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, il est clair qu\u2019un litige est raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 par les appelants le 28 avril 2009, ou m\u00eame avant, avec les autorit\u00e9s fiscales. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une simple possibilit\u00e9 ou d\u2019un soup\u00e7on.\n[53] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour note que dans l\u2019affaire Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Deputy Attorney General) [1982] C.T.C.121), la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique s\u2019est attard\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 un litige avec les autorit\u00e9s fiscales devenait raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9, et a conclu que ce moment peut \u00eatre aussi t\u00f4t que la date d\u2019un document d\u00e9taillant une planification fiscale qui sera probablement contest\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales.\n[54] Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si tel est le cas, puisque la Cour conclut que le litige est raisonnablement appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 le 28 avril 2009, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les appelants savaient \u00e0 ce moment que la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des montants pay\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines serait contest\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s fiscales et ont tent\u00e9 par le courriel de d\u00e9crire les circonstances ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[55] Les deux conditions \u00e0 l\u2019application du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00e9tant r\u00e9unies, et aucune des exceptions restreintes \u00e0 son application n\u2019\u00e9tant applicable (soit les exceptions relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, et autres exceptions de nature criminelle ou encore, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure (Blank, supra, par. 44)), la Cour conclut que le courriel dat\u00e9 du 28 avril 2009 est couvert par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et est donc exclu de la preuve.\nVI. T\u00c9MOIGNAGES\nA. Les t\u00e9moignages de M. Plante et M. Mavrovic\n[56] Au cours des ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9es par les appels, M. Plante d\u00e9tenait la majorit\u00e9 des actions de SPE et en \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident. D\u00e9butant vers les ann\u00e9es 2001-2002, M. Mavrovic \u00e9tait le conseiller financier de M. Plante. M. Mavrovic a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 de SPE pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode, ainsi que vice-pr\u00e9sident.\n(1) Avant 2001 : d\u00e9veloppement du progiciel\n[57] M. Plante d\u00e9tient une formation en \u00e9valuation des b\u00e2timents obtenue au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980. En 1987, apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 dans ce domaine pendant quelques ann\u00e9es, il a fond\u00e9 une entreprise exploit\u00e9e dans la ville de Qu\u00e9bec, et par la suite, dans la r\u00e9gion de St-Georges de Beauce, sous le nom de \u00ab Chiasson, Plante et Associ\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[58] En 1998, M. Plante a incorpor\u00e9 son entreprise sous le nom \u00ab Services Pr\u00e9ventifs d\u2019\u00e9valuation Robert Plante \u00bb; en 2004, le nom a chang\u00e9 pour \u00ab SPE Valeur Assurable Inc. \u00bb.\n[59] SPE offrait alors des services d\u2019\u00e9valuation en valeur assurable (soit la valeur \u00e0 neuf des b\u00e2timents et \u00e9quipements aux fins de protection dans le cadre de polices d\u2019assurance), ainsi qu\u2019en valeur marchande (aux fins de financement ou autres).\n[60] SPE se sp\u00e9cialisait \u00e9galement dans la gestion de maintenance assist\u00e9e par ordinateur pour diverses industries. Selon M. Plante, il y avait un tr\u00e8s grand potentiel de d\u00e9veloppement dans le domaine de la valeur assurable.\n[61] En 1998, comme M. Plante a \u00e9valu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait un grand besoin de logiciels pour g\u00e9rer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif des entreprises, SPE a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un premier logiciel, qui \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t une base de donn\u00e9es, mais qui n\u2019a pas eu de succ\u00e8s.\n[62] \u00c0 cette m\u00eame \u00e9poque, vers 1998, M. Plante a fait la rencontre de M. Mavrovic. Ce dernier est comptable de formation et \u00e9tait alors directeur des services administratifs et d\u00e9veloppement des affaires de Prolab Technologies, entreprise cot\u00e9e en bourse, pour les \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[63] M. Mavrovic a guid\u00e9 M. Plante pour obtenir des fonds provenant de diverses sources de financement afin d\u2019assurer la croissance de l\u2019entreprise, et le d\u00e9veloppement du logiciel.\n[64] En 1999-2000, M. Plante a engag\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pr\u00e9cicom Technologies Inc., pour d\u00e9velopper un v\u00e9ritable logiciel permettant la gestion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif des entreprises, ainsi que la maintenance dans les entreprises.\n[65] Ce logiciel, appel\u00e9 Progiciel SPE Pro, soit le progiciel, permettait d\u2019effectuer un suivi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019actif et de mettre en place un syst\u00e8me d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif et de gestion des pi\u00e8ces. Le progiciel \u00e9tait programm\u00e9 en langage C++ et l\u2019application utilisait les technologies du Palm Pilot et des codes \u00e0 barres. L\u2019installation du progiciel se faisait par disques, et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible sur le Web.\n[66] SPE a vendu le progiciel \u00e0 plusieurs entreprises au Qu\u00e9bec. SPE concluait avec ses clients des contrats de vente de logiciels, et offrait \u00e9galement des services d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Les clients demandaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des modifications au progiciel en fonction de leurs besoins particuliers, ce qui engendrait des co\u00fbts importants.\n[67] Toutefois, selon M. Plante, l\u2019entreprise \u00e9tait mal structur\u00e9e. Le d\u00e9veloppement du progiciel a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteux. Les probl\u00e8mes financiers ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 par la suite.\n(2) En 2001 : mise en place de la SPEQ\n[68] \u00c0 la suggestion de M. Mavrovic, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de placement dans l\u2019entreprise qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, soit la SPEQ SPE Technologies Inc. (la \u00ab SPEQ \u00bb), a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place en octobre 2001 pour recueillir des fonds pour SPE. L\u2019objectif de M. Plante \u00e9tait alors de payer les comptes de SPE, de d\u00e9velopper davantage le progiciel ainsi que le march\u00e9 au Canada et en Am\u00e9rique du Nord. Les actionnaires de la SPEQ \u00e9taient des clients de SPE ainsi que des connaissances de M. Plante. La SPEQ, dont M. Mavrovic \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident, a inject\u00e9 750 000 $ dans le capital-actions de SPE.\n[69] La SPEQ ainsi que les subventions et pr\u00eats gouvernementaux obtenus par SPE s\u2019inscrivaient alors dans un plan plus large, soit celui de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne et de commercialiser le progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. La voie de l\u2019appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne sera toutefois abandonn\u00e9e en 2006, compte tenu des taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et de l\u2019absence de vente du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n(3) En 2002-2003 : les licences de territoires et les ententes de publicit\u00e9\n(a) les licences de territoires\n[70] Au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2002, M. Mavrovic, alors vice-pr\u00e9sident de SPE, a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une \u00e9tude de march\u00e9 et \u00e9labor\u00e9 un plan marketing (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 19, dat\u00e9 de septembre 2002 et mis \u00e0 jour en juin 2003), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par M. Plante. Selon ce plan, il \u00e9tait opportun pour SPE de cibler les efforts de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel au Qu\u00e9bec, le march\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e9tant \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 10, 3M $. De plus, il \u00e9tait opportun de viser \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper dans un objectif de 3 ans le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 646M $ US. Les strat\u00e9gies d\u00e9crites dans le plan marketing incluaient d\u2019engager un repr\u00e9sentant et de faire des alliances avec des distributeurs de solutions logistiques parrain\u00e9es par le repr\u00e9sentant (p.14 du plan marketing).\n[71] Ainsi, SPE a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019explorer et de d\u00e9velopper le march\u00e9 des petites et moyennes entreprises aux \u00c9tats-Unis, soit plus particuli\u00e8rement en Nouvelle-Angleterre, dans le Midwest am\u00e9ricain et le centre-est am\u00e9ricain (et au Mexique), car le march\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et le march\u00e9 canadien n\u2019offraient pas un retour sur investissement suffisant.\n[72] Selon M. Plante, afin de mener \u00e0 terme ce projet, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour SPE d\u2019obtenir des fonds additionnels. \u00c0 cette fin, M. Mavrovic a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de mettre en place des licences de territoires, un syst\u00e8me que M. Mavrovic comparait aux franchises.\n[73] En vertu de ce programme de ventes de licences de territoires, les march\u00e9s am\u00e9ricain et mexicain \u00e9taient d\u00e9coup\u00e9s en 40 \u00e0 42 territoires approximativement, en tenant compte du nombre d\u2019entreprises par \u00e9tat.\n[74] Chaque licence de territoire \u00e9tait vendue au prix de 40 000 $. L\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de la licence (le licenci\u00e9) obtenait en \u00e9change du versement de cette somme des droits non exclusifs de vendre des licences du progiciel aux entreprises int\u00e9ress\u00e9es situ\u00e9es sur un territoire donn\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e de 25 ans (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 136, pp. 2238-2239 et onglet 126, p. 2160). Le contrat de licence ne pr\u00e9voyait toutefois pas de redevances payables \u00e0 SPE dans le cas de vente par le licenci\u00e9. SPE s\u2019engageait \u00e0 fournir au licenci\u00e9 les modifications et am\u00e9liorations au progiciel pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix ans. SPE a vendu une quarantaine de licences de territoires au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002-2003, la grande majorit\u00e9 des licenci\u00e9s \u00e9tant des amis proches de M. Plante ainsi que des actionnaires de la SPEQ.\n[75] \u00c9galement, une entente de distribution dat\u00e9e du 9 mai 2003 a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre SPE et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Luc Pelchat, Pelchat Consultares S.A.C.V. (\u00e0 titre de distributeur) pour d\u00e9velopper le march\u00e9 mexicain, de m\u00eame que les march\u00e9s de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Sud, de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique centrale et des Antilles (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 47).\n(b) les ententes de publicit\u00e9\n[76] En plus d\u2019avoir mis en place un syst\u00e8me de licences de territoires, SPE a \u00e9galement conclu des ententes de publicit\u00e9 avec diverses personnes, ces ententes \u00e9tant similaires aux contrats de licences.\n[77] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Lessard a conclu deux ententes de publicit\u00e9 pour le progiciel, et a vers\u00e9 80 000 $ \u00e0 SPE Affacturage qui agissait pour SPE Marketing (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 141 et 142).\n(c) les ventes du progiciel\n[78] Au deuxi\u00e8me anniversaire du progiciel, SPE avait fait sept ventes du progiciel, totalisant environ 35 000 $ (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 12).\n[79] Selon M. Plante, il y aura eu tr\u00e8s peu de ventes du progiciel \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Qu\u00e9bec. Au Mexique, il y aura eu une ou deux ventes, alors qu\u2019aux \u00c9tats-Unis, il n\u2019y aura eu qu\u2019une seule vente (au centre de ski Wachusett Mountain).\n(4) Fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 et les ann\u00e9es 2004 et suivantes\n[80] M. Mavrovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2003, il a rencontr\u00e9 un certain M. Clermont pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de la possibilit\u00e9 de confier \u00e0 un tiers le d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain pour le progiciel. M. Clermont aurait manifest\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 le faire, et aurait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mavrovic qu\u2019il lui en co\u00fbterait environ 50 000 $ US par mois.\n[81] Selon M. Plante, vu les co\u00fbts importants estim\u00e9s par M. Clermont pour d\u00e9velopper le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Mavrovic s\u2019occuperait lui-m\u00eame de trouver des repr\u00e9sentants aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour effectuer le d\u00e9marchage aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[82] M. Mavrovic a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait mettre en place une structure aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour assurer le succ\u00e8s des activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchage, puisqu\u2019il fallait des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour effectuer le d\u00e9marchage aux \u00c9tats-Unis. C\u2019est pour ces raisons que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es et auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9es de faire la mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel moyennant le paiement d\u2019une somme de 33 000 $ US par mois.\n(a) les agents commerciaux am\u00e9ricains\n[83] \u00c0 compter du mois d\u2019octobre 2003, M. Mavrovic a achet\u00e9 plusieurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s tablettes incorpor\u00e9es selon les lois de l\u2019\u00e9tat du Wyoming aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un avocat am\u00e9ricain, M. Guillermo Jalil, dont les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes : A+Shadow, Apnet, For Impex, IntroTech, Rockman Connections, Inc. (\u00ab Rockman \u00bb), Mercator Corporation, Inc. (\u00ab Mercator \u00bb), Net Windows, et Wysco Systems, Inc. (\u00ab Wysco \u00bb). M. Jalil a \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la constitution des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s SPE Marketing et Structured Management selon les lois de l\u2019\u00e9tat du Wyoming.\n[84] Selon M. Plante, M. Mavrovic \u00e9tait en charge de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, ou en \u00e9tait administrateur. M. Jalil \u00e9tait le signataire autoris\u00e9 aux comptes bancaires de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, ainsi que sur les ch\u00e8ques, l\u2019officier signataire pour toutes ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et il s\u2019occupait de pr\u00e9parer et de d\u00e9poser les rapports corporatifs aupr\u00e8s des \u00e9tats am\u00e9ricains.\n[85] SPE aurait alors engag\u00e9 des agents commerciaux am\u00e9ricains, soit M. Letarte ainsi que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus, pour d\u00e9velopper le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain en vertu de plusieurs conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale appel\u00e9es \u00ab Sales Agency Agreements \u00bb.\n[86] Selon M. Mavrovic, Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing s\u2019occupaient du d\u00e9marchage pour le progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. A+Shadow offrait des services de gestion. M. Plante ne d\u00e9tenait des actions que dans le capital de SPE Marketing (1\/6), les autres actionnaires \u00e9tant M. Mavrovic et d\u2019autres personnes. M. Mavrovic et d\u2019autres personnes d\u00e9tenaient les actions d\u2019Apnet, de For Impex et de A+Shadow.\n[87] Structured Management aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise sur pied pour l\u2019un des plus importants d\u00e9tenteurs de licences, soit M. Lessard, afin d\u2019effectuer les activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchage du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. IntroTech aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e pour un autre licenci\u00e9, soit M. Gilbert, afin d\u2019effectuer les activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchage du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. En effet, selon M. Mavrovic, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu avec les licenci\u00e9s de confier le d\u00e9marchage du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es selon les lois du Wyoming. Chaque licenci\u00e9 \u00e9tait actionnaire de sa propre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, avec M. Mavrovic et d\u2019autres personnes. M. Plante ne d\u00e9tenait pas d\u2019actions dans le capital de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Selon M. Mavrovic, cette structure permettait au licenci\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des ventes du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[88] M. Mavrovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vu le succ\u00e8s des ventes de licences de territoires, il avait d\u00fb se d\u00e9p\u00eacher \u00e0 trouver des repr\u00e9sentants pour couvrir tous les territoires vis\u00e9s par les licences de territoires, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9norme travail. M. Mavrovic a donc retenu les services d\u2019un certain Joel Green, pr\u00e9sident d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e International Sales Network, pour l\u2019\u00e9pauler dans ce travail. L\u2019\u00e9quipe de M. Green \u00e9tait form\u00e9e d\u2019une quarantaine d\u2019agents manufacturiers aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[89] Selon les appelants, lorsque les agents identifiaient une entreprise qui semblait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, M. Mavrovic et M. Plante se d\u00e9pla\u00e7aient alors aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour pr\u00e9senter le progiciel et toutes ses possibilit\u00e9s et tentaient ainsi de clore la transaction. M. Paquin, programmeur chez SPE, est aussi all\u00e9 plusieurs fois aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour pr\u00e9senter le progiciel. Bien que la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les agents connaissaient \u00e0 peine le progiciel, M. Mavrovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour eux de connaitre le produit puisque ce sera M. Plante et lui-m\u00eame qui se d\u00e9placeront aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour tenter de clore les ventes et pr\u00e9senter le progiciel aux entreprises ayant d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le progiciel.\n[90] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines au cours des ann\u00e9es en cause \u00e0 titre de frais de marketing pour d\u00e9velopper le progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n(b) les conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale\n[91] En 2003, Apnet et M. Plante ont conclu une convention de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale pour la distribution du Ramjet (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 7, p. 70) en contrepartie du paiement par M. Plante d\u2019un montant de 10 000 $ US pour deux mois, montant qui ne sera jamais pay\u00e9 par M. Plante, tel que ce dernier l\u2019a admis \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[92] Les appelants ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve six copies de conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 8, en liasse) conclues par SPE en 2003 et en 2005 pr\u00e9voyant le paiement par SPE \u00e0 Apnet, SPE Marketing et \u00e0 M. Letarte de certains montants \u00e0 titre de commissions payables d\u2019avance pour la mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[93] Les appelants n\u2019ont produit en preuve aucune convention de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre SPE et l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de For Impex, Structured Management, A+Shadow ou IntroTech.\n[94] Peu apr\u00e8s la conclusion de la convention de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale entre SPE et Apnet dat\u00e9e du 1er octobre 2003, SPE a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 transf\u00e9rer des fonds aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Les conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale seront modifi\u00e9es en 2005 pour pr\u00e9voir des r\u00e9partitions diff\u00e9rentes entre les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[95] Selon les appelants, les conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale couvrent la p\u00e9riode d\u2019octobre 2003 au mois de janvier 2006.\n[96] En janvier 2006, selon M. Plante, SPE n\u2019aura toutefois pas vers\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des sommes payables en vertu des conventions et continuera d\u2019effectuer des transferts d\u2019argent apr\u00e8s cette date pour respecter ses engagements. Les sommes payables en vertu des conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale n\u2019auront toutefois jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es en totalit\u00e9 par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n(c) efforts additionnels pour obtenir du financement\n[97] SPE va continuer \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer des efforts pour r\u00e9aliser un appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne. La notice d\u2019offre sera produite le 23 novembre 2006, puis abandonn\u00e9e en 2007. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, SPE a, entre autres, fait pr\u00e9parer des \u00e9tats financiers v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s et a entrepris des d\u00e9marches additionnelles pour r\u00e9aliser l\u2019appel public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pargne.\n[98] Toutes les d\u00e9marches effectu\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats-Unis se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9es des \u00e9checs puisque le progiciel d\u00e9pendait d\u2019un serveur, alors que les entreprises recherchaient plut\u00f4t un logiciel en ligne (web-base).\n[99] Selon les appelants, plusieurs clients potentiels am\u00e9ricains avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s, soit Sencorp (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 10), Boulder, Cape Cod Potato Chips, Sugarloaf Mountain, Doug Bottomly, Armor Holdings et Johnson&Johnson. Cependant, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, une seule vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour 1 500 $ US au centre de ski Wachusett Mountain, march\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 avec l\u2019aide de M. Letarte.\n(d) les transferts totalisant 1 526 143 $\n[100] M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res depuis 2004. Ainsi, puisque le salaire vers\u00e9 par SPE \u00e9tait insuffisant pour lui permettre de combler ses besoins personnels, M. Mavrovic aurait alors convenu de lui consentir des pr\u00eats personnels, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019Apnet, de For Impex et de SPE Marketing, \u00e0 la condition que les actions que M. Plante d\u00e9tenait dans le capital de SPE soient mises en garantie des pr\u00eats ainsi consentis. Selon les appelants, Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing avaient des liquidit\u00e9s disponibles puisqu\u2019en l\u2019absence de ventes du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis, elles n\u2019avaient pas de commissions \u00e0 verser.\n[101] Selon M. Plante, il empruntait selon ses besoins qu\u2019il communiquait \u00e0 M. Mavrovic. Ce dernier maintenait la comptabilit\u00e9 des sommes ainsi emprunt\u00e9es. M. Plante n\u2019a maintenu aucun registre des pr\u00eats qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consentis, mais il aurait sign\u00e9 des billets \u00e0 ordre constatant ces emprunts. Selon M. Plante, d\u00e9butant en 2004, il aurait ainsi emprunt\u00e9 environ 606 000 $ US.\n[102] \u00c0 ce titre, les appelants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve une lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 septembre 2012 sign\u00e9e par A+Shadow (agissant pour le compte des cr\u00e9anciers Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing), et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Plante et SPE (sign\u00e9e par eux \u00e9galement), par laquelle ces derniers ont reconnu l\u2019endettement totalisant 606 740,36 $ US et ont accept\u00e9 de rembourser mensuellement une somme de 1 000 $ US sans int\u00e9r\u00eat plus 10% des liquidit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles de SPE d\u00e9butant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2012; en cas de d\u00e9faut, le solde deviendrait imm\u00e9diatement exigible avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 8% (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 7).\n[103] \u00c9galement, en vertu de ce m\u00eame document, M. Plante aurait convenu de mettre en garantie les actions de SPE. \u00c0 ce document \u00e9taient joints deux billets \u00e0 ordre : i) billet \u00e0 ordre \u00e9mis par M. Plante au nom de Forimpex (le nom de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est \u00e9crit de cette fa\u00e7on dans le document) dat\u00e9 du 30 novembre 2005 au montant de 96 000 $ US, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% et garanti par les actions de SPE; ii) billet \u00e0 ordre \u00e9mis par M. Plante au nom de Apnet dat\u00e9 du 30 septembre 2006 au montant de 278 240 $ US, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% et garanti par les actions de SPE (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 7).\n[104] En outre, le 24 mars 2017, M. Plante aurait c\u00e9d\u00e9 une police d\u2019assurance-vie au capital assur\u00e9 de 800 000 $ \u00e9mise le 20 mars 2017 \u00e0 titre de nantissement pour les dettes dues \u00e0 A+Shadow, afin de garantir le remboursement des pr\u00eats (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 48). En vertu de ce contrat, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la police est A+Shadow \u00e0 100% et la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire subrog\u00e9e est la conjointe de M. Plante (voir p. 19).\n[105] En somme, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de mars 2004 \u00e0 novembre 2008, M. Plante a re\u00e7u des montants totalisant 877 808 $ d\u2019Apnet, de For Impex et de SPE Marketing (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 308).\n[106] D\u2019autres montants totalisant approximativement 648 335 $ (ou 607 717 $, selon le taux de change utilis\u00e9) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante mais auraient plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 certaines autres personnes (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 308 et 309).\n[107] Depuis 2004, et jusqu\u2019en date de l\u2019audition des appels en 2017, aucun cr\u00e9ancier n\u2019a entrepris de proc\u00e9dure pour faire valoir ses droits ou pour obtenir le remboursement des sommes dues par M. Plante. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Plante, il aurait demand\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9anciers d\u2019\u00eatre patient.\n[108] Vers les ann\u00e9es 2012 et 2013, les transferts se sont termin\u00e9s. M. Plante a cess\u00e9 de d\u00e9velopper le progiciel et de r\u00e9investir dans la programmation pour stabiliser l\u2019entreprise.\nB. Les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Drew et de M. Potvin\n[109] La v\u00e9rification des affaires de SPE a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de la v\u00e9rification de M. Cl\u00e9ment Baillargeon, un ami de M. Plante et licenci\u00e9, au cours de laquelle Mme Drew a d\u00e9couvert plusieurs ch\u00e8ques faits par Apnet \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Plante, mais encaiss\u00e9s par M. Baillargeon (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 31). La raison invoqu\u00e9e par M. Plante pour l\u2019encaissement des ch\u00e8ques par M. Baillargeon \u00e9tait le d\u00e9lai important de son institution bancaire \u00e0 lui cr\u00e9diter les sommes en question. M. Baillargeon ne lui chargeait aucun frais pour l\u2019encaissement des ch\u00e8ques.\n[110] La v\u00e9rification de SPE a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e par la demande de redressement de SPE dat\u00e9e de juillet 2006 d\u2019octroyer la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses additionnelles de 621 254 $ qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 capitalis\u00e9es (pi\u00e8ce I-2, deuxi\u00e8me liste suppl\u00e9mentaire de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 1).\n[111] Comme indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la v\u00e9rification effectu\u00e9e par Mme Drew \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par SPE dans le calcul de son revenu au titre des frais de commissions pay\u00e9es aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Mme Drew n\u2019a obtenu que quatre factures pour justifier ces sommes, soit deux factures \u00e9mises par Apnet, une facture \u00e9mise par A+Shadow et une facture \u00e9mise par SPE Marketing (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 305). Mme Drew n\u2019a obtenu aucun compte rendu de la part des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines justifiant les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour vendre le progiciel.\n[112] Mme Drew n\u2019a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 que des projets de cotisation, puisqu\u2019en raison de son absence du travail, les dossiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 une autre v\u00e9rificatrice, Mme Morin. Mme Morin a envoy\u00e9 les dossiers de SPE et de M. Plante aux enqu\u00eates criminelles pour fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, dossiers pilot\u00e9s alors par M. Potvin. Toutefois, aucune accusation ne sera port\u00e9e contre eux et les dossiers retourneront \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification.\n[113] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les documents obtenus par Mme Morin, soit les relev\u00e9s des comptes bancaires am\u00e9ricains, les registres de la comptabilit\u00e9 de SPE, les relev\u00e9s des transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, certaines factures et ch\u00e8ques, certains documents concernant certains licenci\u00e9s, M. Potvin a conclu que les sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines revenaient dans les mains de M. Plante ou encore, dans les mains de certaines connaissances de M. Plante.\n[114] Selon M. Potvin, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par M. Mavrovic, \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une personne pr\u00eate-nom, soit M. Jalil, et ensuite par M. Letarte qui le remplacera.\n[115] En ce qui concerne SPE Affacturage, cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9e aux fins des d\u00e9penses de publicit\u00e9.\n[116] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de ces appels, les onglets 306 \u00e0 309 de la pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. Ces onglets sont les feuilles de travail de M. Potvin, auxquelles la Cour reviendra ci-dessous.\nVII. DISCUSSION\nA. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages\n[117] L\u2019issue de ces appels repose sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages entendus \u00e0 l\u2019audition, au regard de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve produite au cours du proc\u00e8s, incluant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire retenus.\n[118] Tel que l\u2019a si bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la juge Miller dans l\u2019affaire Nichols c. La Reine, 2009 CCI 334 :\n[23] En mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, je peux tenir compte des incoh\u00e9rences ou des faiblesses que comporte le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins, y compris les incoh\u00e9rences internes (si le t\u00e9moignage change pendant que le t\u00e9moin est \u00e0 la barre ou s'il diverge du t\u00e9moignage rendu \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable), les d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures contradictoires et les incoh\u00e9rences externes (soit lorsque le t\u00e9moignage est incompatible avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ind\u00e9pendants que j\u2019ai accept\u00e9s). Il m\u2019est ensuite loisible d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019attitude et le comportement du t\u00e9moin. Troisi\u00e8mement, je peux rechercher si le t\u00e9moin a des raisons de rendre un faux t\u00e9moignage ou d\u2019induire la Cour en erreur. Enfin, je peux prendre en compte la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve. C\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que j\u2019ai toute latitude pour rechercher si l\u2019examen du t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun donne \u00e0 penser que les faits expos\u00e9s sont impossibles ou hautement improbables.\n[119] Apr\u00e8s avoir revu l\u2019ensemble des t\u00e9moignages entendus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et consid\u00e9rant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire retenus, la Cour conclut que M. Plante et M. Mavrovic n\u2019ont pas rendu un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible et fiable sur plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels qui auraient pu permettre aux appelants d\u2019avoir gain de cause dans ces appels. La Cour retient toutefois les t\u00e9moignages de M. Ouellette, M. Paquin, Mme Arbour, Mme Drew et M. Potvin. En ce qui concerne le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard, la Cour n\u2019en retiendra qu\u2019une partie.\n(1) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Plante\n[120] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Plante est un t\u00e9moin int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Son t\u00e9moignage au sujet des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines est \u00e9vasif. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante s\u2019en remet la plupart du temps \u00e0 M. Mavrovic, se disant incapable de r\u00e9pondre aux questions qui lui sont pos\u00e9es. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il est improbable que le pr\u00e9sident de SPE ait autoris\u00e9 des transferts totalisant plus de 1 500 000 $ sur une p\u00e9riode de quatre ans au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019un nouveau march\u00e9, sans s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir des activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchages effectu\u00e9es ou \u00e0 \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es par ces m\u00eames soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[121] \u00c9galement, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019assurance-vie contract\u00e9e par M. Plante en 2017 par le biais de M. Mavrovic afin de justifier les pr\u00eats, seulement quelques mois avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition des appels, n\u2019est pas r\u00e9aliste.\n[122] La Cour est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. En effet, en ce qui concerne M. Plante, la teneur g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la preuve, soit l\u2019examen de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du sens commun porte \u00e0 conclure que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis et des pr\u00eats n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible.\n[123] En effet, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Plante est un homme d\u2019affaires avis\u00e9, bien inform\u00e9 et bien \u00e9duqu\u00e9, ayant une bonne connaissance de la structure de son entreprise, et qui a su faire fructifier les affaires de SPE au cours des ann\u00e9es. Son t\u00e9moignage relatif \u00e0 l\u2019historique de SPE, des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res rencontr\u00e9es au cours des ann\u00e9es et la mani\u00e8re de les surmonter d\u00e9montre sa connaissance approfondie des affaires.\n[124] Toutefois, en ce qui concerne les questions sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines et le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis, de m\u00eame que pour les divers pr\u00eats, M. Plante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a peu de connaissances et que M. Mavrovic s\u2019occupait de tout cet aspect, ce qui me semble invraisemblable, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments mentionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. \u00c0 ce titre :\ni)M. Plante ne peut justifier comment les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pouvaient s\u2019occuper du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis si les fonds envoy\u00e9s par SPE pour le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires \u00e9taient en fait utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins (par exemple, par des pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00eats au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante ou des transferts \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes) (transcriptions, 30 octobre 2017, p. 230, interrogatoire de M. Plante);\nii)M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas les activit\u00e9s des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant des finances de celles-ci et savait simplement que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines repr\u00e9sentaient SPE aux \u00c9tats-Unis (transcriptions, 30 octobre 2017, p. 236, l. 5 \u00e0 p. 237, l.21, interrogatoire de M. Plante).\n[125] De plus, selon M. Mavrovic et M. Plante, les importantes sommes de 1 526 143 $ transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines sont justifi\u00e9es par les grands espoirs que ceux-ci entretenaient quant au succ\u00e8s de l\u2019entreprise aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Toutefois, aucun document justificatif n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sauf pour certaines conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale et quelques factures.\n[126] M. Plante explique l\u2019absence de pi\u00e8ces justificatives quant aux efforts ou aux heures consacr\u00e9es par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines au d\u00e9veloppement des affaires du progiciel par le fait qu\u2019elles agissaient \u00e0 titre de sous-traitants (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 97, l.11 \u00e0 22, interrogatoire de M. Plante).\n[127] Cependant, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que SPE a pay\u00e9 pour l\u2019impression des cartes d\u2019affaires des repr\u00e9sentants am\u00e9ricains (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 38, pp. 465-466). Si les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines agissaient comme sous-traitant comme M. Plante le pr\u00e9tendait, il est plut\u00f4t curieux que SPE ait pay\u00e9 les frais pour les cartes d\u2019affaires de ces personnes (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 61, l. 16 \u00e0 p. 63, l.4, interrogatoire de M. Plante).\n[128] En outre, la Cour estime que la raison invoqu\u00e9e par M. Plante pour justifier l\u2019absence de pi\u00e8ces justificatives ne peut \u00eatre retenue. En effet, un payeur aurait encore plus int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 obtenir des pi\u00e8ces justificatives avant de payer un sous-traitant, que si un paiement est fait \u00e0 une filiale, par exemple.\n[129] \u00c9galement, M. Plante n\u2019a pu expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles certaines conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sign\u00e9es par SPE, ou encore par l\u2019autre partie (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 145 l.1 \u00e0 10, contre-interrogatoire de M. Plante) ou bien que la m\u00eame convention \u00e9tait sign\u00e9e par deux personnes diff\u00e9rentes repr\u00e9sentant la m\u00eame partie (par exemple, M. Green et M. Letarte signent pour SPE Marketing) (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 146, l. 26 \u00e0 148 l. 3, contre-interrogatoire de M. Plante).\n[130] La Cour estime \u00e9galement que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Plante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pr\u00eats est vague et impr\u00e9cis. Selon la Cour, les faits suivants tendent \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l\u2019invraisemblance de l\u2019existence de pr\u00eats entre M. Plante et ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[131] En ce qui concerne les pr\u00eats pr\u00e9tendument effectu\u00e9s par Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante, il est invraisemblable que M. Plante ait emprunt\u00e9 une somme de plus de 800 000 $ (environ 600 000 $ US) sans tenir de registres quelconques. M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Mavrovic tenait un registre des sommes qui lui \u00e9taient pr\u00eat\u00e9es par ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, registre qui n\u2019a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve. M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas comment M. Mavrovic maintenait le registre (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 77. L. 14 \u00e0 p. 80, l.1, contre-interrogatoire de M. Plante).\n[132] De plus, en 2017, au moment de l\u2019audition des appels, M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune somme en capital ou int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9e \u00e0 Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing, bien qu\u2019il ait toujours eu l\u2019intention de les rembourser, et que ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019avaient entrepris aucune mesure de recouvrement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des sommes dues (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 69, l. 3 \u00e0 l. 22 et p. 68, l. 9 \u00e0 6 p. 69, l.11, interrogatoire de M. Plante), ce qui me semble aussi invraisemblable.\n[133] Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante ne se souvient pas si d\u2019autres billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s, autres que deux billets, l\u2019un de 96 000 $ US \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de For Impex et l\u2019autre de 278 240 $ US \u00e0 l\u2019ordre d\u2019Apnet (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 7) (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 88, l 7 \u00e0 l, 18, contre-interrogatoire de M. Plante). Le document refl\u00e9tant la dette de M. Plante au montant de 606 740,36 $ US est dat\u00e9 du 19 septembre 2012 (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 7), alors que les pr\u00eats auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9s plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant, soit entre 2004 et 2008 (transcriptions, 2 novembre 2017, p. 72, l. 16 \u00e0 l. 20, interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic). La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que deux billets \u00e0 ordre refl\u00e9tant une partie des pr\u00eats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en janvier 2007, alors que les emprunts avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s en mars 2004 ou au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, selon le cas (transcriptions, 2 novembre 2017, p. 317, l. 23 \u00e0 p. 319, l. 11, contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic).\n[134] La Cour ne peut non plus retenir la version de M. Plante \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la raison pour laquelle les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines transitaient par le compte bancaire de M. Baillargeon \u00e9tait due au fait que sa propre banque retenait les fonds pendant un mois environ, alors que M. Baillargeon pouvait \u00e9changer les ch\u00e8ques et lui remettre l\u2019argent imm\u00e9diatement (transcriptions, 31 octobre 2017, p. 102 l. 4 \u00e0 l. 15, contre-interrogatoire de M. Plante). En effet, les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par M. Potvin indiquent plut\u00f4t que les d\u00e9lais de traitement de deux ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante \u00e9taient de 18 jours et de 6 jours (transcriptions, 6 novembre 2017, p. 100, l. 23 \u00e0 p. 101, l. 14, interrogatoire de M. Potvin).\n[135] Pour toutes ces raisons, la Cour conclut que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Plante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, du d\u00e9veloppement des affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis et des pr\u00eats n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible.\n(2) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic\n[136] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour n\u2019accordera aucun poids au t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, du d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain et des pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00eats au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante et des transferts \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n[137] La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic est fortement entach\u00e9e \u00e0 la lecture des courriels dont il est l\u2019auteur et qui ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une requ\u00eate des appelants pour \u00eatre exclus de la preuve suite \u00e0 l\u2019audition des appels, et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la juge D\u2019Auray le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2019 (motifs publi\u00e9s sous 2019 CCI 174).\n[138] Ces courriels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous les onglets 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75 \u00e0 78, 80 \u00e0 91, 94, 97, 99, 102, 104, 105 \u00e0 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120, 122 de la pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et sous l\u2019onglet 24 de la pi\u00e8ce I-6, Liste suppl\u00e9mentaire de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[139] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re du contenu de ces courriels, il est clair que M. Mavrovic a des raisons de ne pas dire toute la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour. Ainsi, la Cour ne peut donner de poids au t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, du d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain et des pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00eats au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante et des transferts \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes, t\u00e9moignage que la Cour qualifie de non cr\u00e9dible.\n[140] Tout d\u2019abord, dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 la Cour, M. Mavrovic ne peut expliquer le contenu de plusieurs courriels ou les raisons justifiant l\u2019envoi de ceux-ci :\ni)Courriel dat\u00e9 du 5 mai 2006 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Letarte : M. Mavrovic a indiqu\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019op\u00e8rent pas et donc, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019imp\u00f4t; de plus, il a ajout\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019ont pour objet que d\u2019investir dans l\u2019immobilier ou dans des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de capital de risque, soit des \u00ab capital ventures \u00bb. M. Mavrovic a ajout\u00e9 que les fonds des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient des fonds apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4ts (transcriptions, 2 novembre 2017, p. 308, l. 27 \u00e0 p. 311, l.21; contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic; pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 102);\nii)Courriel dat\u00e9 du 12 mars 2004 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gosselin : M. Mavrovic a indiqu\u00e9 avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 des factures \u00e9mises par IntroTech modifi\u00e9es en fonction du revenu brut de IntroTech (transcriptions, 3 novembre2017, p. 36, l. 14 \u00e0 l. 28; contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic; pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 109);\niii)Courriel dat\u00e9 du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2007 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bilodeau : M. Mavrovic a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bilodeau de cr\u00e9er une d\u00e9pense \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger dans le cadre des \u00e9tats financiers de Wysco; lors de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Mavrovic a admis avoir \u00ab p\u00eat\u00e9 une bulle \u00bb en faisant cette proposition \u00e0 M. Bilodeau (transcriptions, 3 novembre 2017, p. 49, l. 11 \u00e0 p. 50, l. 14; contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic; pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 112);\niv)Courriel dat\u00e9 du 26 f\u00e9vrier 2004 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bilodeau : M. Mavrovic a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une d\u00e9pense de mise en march\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 USA Inc. en fonction de ses profits (transcriptions, 3 novembre 2017, p. 76, l. 8 \u00e0 l. 19; contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic; pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 120).\n[141] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour consid\u00e8re que le contenu du premier courriel est tr\u00e8s probl\u00e9matique. Puisque l\u2019objet du courriel est \u00ab check accounts \u00bb, il est clair que ce courriel r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour lesquelles M. Letarte est signataire des ch\u00e8ques. Cependant, la version des faits des appelants soutenue devant la Cour est tout \u00e0 fait contraire \u00e0 ce que ce courriel indique : comment pr\u00e9tendre que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019op\u00e8rent pas si elles rendent des services aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour trouver des pistes pour la vente du progiciel (ou \u00ab lead \u00bb)? De plus, comment pr\u00e9tendre que les fonds re\u00e7us par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines sont des fonds apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4t si ces fonds sont re\u00e7us en \u00e9change de services rendus?\n[142] \u00c9galement, le 29 janvier 2005, M. Mavrovic a fait parvenir un courriel \u00e0 M. Letarte concernant les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines par lequel M. Mavrovic a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Letarte s\u2019il peut agir \u00e0 titre d\u2019administrateur am\u00e9ricain et signataire pour les ch\u00e8ques (\u00ab US director and check signer \u00bb) pour sept soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines qu\u2019il g\u00e8re (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 85). Dans ce m\u00eame courriel, M. Mavrovic a ajout\u00e9 que ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s agissent \u00e0 titre de protecteur de patrimoine (soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de portefeuille) (\u00ab These companies act as asset protector (holding) \u00bb).\n[143] Bien que les appelants ont tent\u00e9 de maintenir \u00e0 l\u2019audience que le courriel ne mentionne pas les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines auxquelles il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il est clair que ce courriel r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, un courriel de la m\u00eame date a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par M. Mavrovic \u00e0 M. Jalil lui indiquant que M. Letarte le remplacera \u00e0 titre de signataire des ch\u00e8ques, et r\u00e9f\u00e8re ainsi aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 84).\n[144] En effet, environ un mois auparavant (en d\u00e9cembre 2004), M. Jalil avait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mavrovic qu\u2019il ne pourrait plus signer les ch\u00e8ques et ne serait plus un signataire autoris\u00e9 aux comptes bancaires, mais qu\u2019il pourrait continuer \u00e0 offrir les autres services corporatifs (maintien du statut des corporations, suivi du courrier, et services de dirigeant corporatif) (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 81 : courriel dat\u00e9 du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2004). Par la suite, par courriel dat\u00e9 du 28 janvier 2005, M. Jalil avait avis\u00e9 M. Mavrovic que l\u2019Internal Revenue Service (\u00c9tats-Unis) mena\u00e7ait de saisir les comptes de ses clients et qu\u2019il ne pourrait donc plus \u00eatre le signataire autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque et sur les ch\u00e8ques, mais pourra continuer \u00e0 offrir les autres services : dirigeant corporatif et suivi du courrier (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 84).\n[145] Ensuite, par courriel dat\u00e9 du 31 janvier 2005, M. Mavrovic a envoy\u00e9 une convention de services et une lettre d\u2019indemnisation (\u00ab Services Agreement and letter of indemnity \u00bb) \u00e0 M. Letarte pour huit soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, incluant Apnet, For Impex, A+Shadow, SPE Marketing, IntroTech, Rockman, Wysco, et Mercator. Il y est pr\u00e9vu que M. Letarte, \u00e0 titre d\u2019administrateur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 (\u00ab Nominee Director \u00bb) sera le signataire autoris\u00e9 pour tous les documents officiels des corporations, tels les contrats et les ch\u00e8ques requis par M. Mavrovic de temps \u00e0 autre (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 86).\n[146] La Cour a \u00e9galement tenu compte du courriel envoy\u00e9 par M. Mavrovic \u00e0 M. Letarte en date du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2005 d\u00e9crivant les objets des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 97). Selon ce courriel, l\u2019objet d\u2019Apnet est \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille \u00bb (\u00ab investment holdings \u00bb); l\u2019objet de A+Shadow est \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille et consultation \u00bb (\u00ab investments holdings and consulting \u00bb); l\u2019objet de Introtech est la consultation (\u00ab consulting \u00bb); l\u2019objet de SPE Marketing est le marketing; et l\u2019objet de For Impex est \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de portefeuille \u00bb (\u00ab investment holdings \u00bb).\n[147] En juin 2006, M. Mavrovic a remplac\u00e9 M. Letarte \u00e0 titre de signataire pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 104).\n[148] Il est donc clair que M. Mavrovic r\u00e9f\u00e9rait aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines lorsqu\u2019il a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Letarte que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines agissaient \u00e0 titre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de portefeuille, ce qui contredit la pr\u00e9tention des appelants selon laquelle les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines effectuaient des activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchage.\n[149] Finalement, certains autres courriels envoy\u00e9s par M. Mavrovic font \u00e9tat de demandes fort particuli\u00e8res.\n[150] Par exemple, par courriel dat\u00e9 du 1er janvier 2004 adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Jalil, M. Mavrovic a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019envoi du paiement de 7 800 $ US pour les frais de constitution des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Jalil de lui faire parvenir une facture indiquant \u00ab Services de consultation \u2013 Finance \u00bb (ou \u00ab Finance Consulting Services \u00bb) afin de pouvoir utiliser celle-ci pour ses imp\u00f4ts canadiens (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 67).\n[151] Pour les motifs suivants, sans m\u00eame consid\u00e9rer les courriels ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s, la Cour arriverait \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion quant \u00e0 l\u2019absence de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, du d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain et des pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00eats au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante et des transferts \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n[152] Tout d\u2019abord, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de la v\u00e9rification, M. Mavrovic a ni\u00e9 avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les factures \u00e9mises par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (transcriptions, 6 novembre 2017, p. 28, l. 14 \u00e0 l. 20; interrogatoire de Mme Drew). Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 2012, dans le cadre de la perquisition effectu\u00e9e par l\u2019ARC, que M. Mavrovic va admettre \u00ab \u00eatre derri\u00e8re les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00bb. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, M. Mavrovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9parait pas toutes les factures \u00e9mises par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (transcriptions, 3 novembre 2017, contre-interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic, p. 60, l.24 \u00e0 p.61, l.1).\n[153] Toutefois, les factures produites en preuve sont toutes du m\u00eame format et contiennent souvent les m\u00eames erreurs de dates; la Cour en conclut donc que M. Mavrovic pr\u00e9parait les factures pour toutes les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[154] Du t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic, la Cour rel\u00e8ve \u00e9galement les invraisemblances suivantes :\ni)La d\u00e9termination des frais mensuels payables par SPE pour le d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on arbitraire (transcriptions, 1er novembre 2017, p. 259, l. 8 \u00e0 p. 261, l.7; interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic); et\nii)SPE ne paie que rarement les montants dus mensuellement en vertu des diverses conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale, puisque SPE ne payait que si elle en avait la capacit\u00e9 (transcriptions, 2 novembre 2017, p. 3, l. 3 \u00e0 p. 5, l. 11; interrogatoire de M. Mavrovic).\n(3) Les t\u00e9moignages de M. Paquin, M. Ouellette, Mme Arbour et Mme Drew\n[155] Ces t\u00e9moins ont rendu des t\u00e9moignages cr\u00e9dibles et constants, autant dans le cadre de leur interrogatoire en chef que lors de leur contre-interrogatoire.\n(4) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard\n[156] M. Lessard est un homme d\u2019affaires. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne appel\u00e9e Forimpex se sp\u00e9cialisant dans l\u2019importation de composantes de portes et fen\u00eatres fabriqu\u00e9es en Asie, au Vietnam et en Chine, de m\u00eame que dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e Alteck pour composantes de portes et fen\u00eatres, et est toujours actionnaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Unicab.\n[157] M. Lessard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant aux montants de 8 975 $ US (9 154 $) et 22 637 $ US (25 030 $) vers\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 Structured Management en janvier 2008 et aout 2008, et dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par le ministre. La Cour ne va pas retenir cette partie du t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard et y reviendra ci-dessous.\n(5) Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Potvin\n[158] M. Potvin a rendu un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible devant la Cour. Il a admis avoir omis d\u2019indiquer certaines transactions bancaires dans les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des transactions qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour (transcriptions, 7 novembre 2017, pp. 161 \u00e0 164, contre-interrogatoire de M. Potvin). Toutefois, ces omissions ne viennent pas entacher la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la fiabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage.\nB. Les appels log\u00e9s par SPE : D\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines\n[159] Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2009, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, selon les instructions de M. Plante, SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des montants totalisant 1 526 143 $ aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 308). Ces transferts ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s par M. Plante et ne sont pas contest\u00e9s par les appelants (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 23 et 26).\n[160] Les demandes de transferts de fonds ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es par M. Plante, au nom de SPE, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Apnet, For Impex, SPE Marketing, A+Shadow, Structured Management et Introtech. Ces demandes indiquent que les fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s sont des frais de marketing (\u00ab marketing fees \u00bb). Selon M. Plante, ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour le d\u00e9veloppement des affaires, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 titre de frais de commercialisation, frais de commissions et frais de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel. Ainsi, selon M. Plante, d\u00e8s que SPE avait des fonds disponibles, SPE les transf\u00e9rait aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[161] Concernant les transferts aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve la feuille de travail de M. Potvin indiquant les d\u00e9penses dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 SPE (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 306).\n(1) Les principes applicables \u00e0 la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9\n[162] Les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi au regard de la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses sont le paragraphe 9(1) et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a), qui se lisent ainsi:\n9(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente partie, le revenu qu\u2019un contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e.\n[\u2026]\n18(1) Exceptions d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2014 Dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019un bien, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants ne sont pas d\u00e9ductibles :\na) Restriction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2014 les d\u00e9penses, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es par le contribuable en vue de tirer un revenu de l\u2019entreprise ou du bien;\n[...]\n[mes soulignements]\n[163] Le paragraphe 9(1) pr\u00e9voit que le revenu qu\u2019un contribuable tire d\u2019une entreprise pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il en tire pour cette ann\u00e9e. Le terme \u00ab b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00bb n\u2019est toutefois pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi.\n[164] Un contribuable est libre d\u2019adopter toute m\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9terminer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il tire d\u2019une entreprise, pourvu que cette m\u00e9thode ne soit pas incompatible avec les dispositions de la Loi, les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s par la jurisprudence ainsi que les principes commerciaux reconnus, et que l\u2019objectif soit d\u2019obtenir une image fid\u00e8le du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e (Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada, [1998] 1 RCS 147, aux par. 50\u201153).\n[165] Ainsi, en vertu du paragraphe 9(1), le contribuable peut d\u00e9duire les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es ou effectu\u00e9es en vue de r\u00e9aliser ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, sous r\u00e9serve des restrictions pr\u00e9vues dans la Loi.\n[166] L\u2019une de ces restrictions se retrouve \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a) qui \u00e9nonce une restriction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a), un contribuable ne pourra d\u00e9duire une d\u00e9pense dans le calcul du revenu tir\u00e9 d\u2019une entreprise que si cette d\u00e9pense a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e ou effectu\u00e9e en vue de tirer un revenu de l\u2019entreprise.\n[167] Il est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une d\u00e9pense peut \u00eatre admise en d\u00e9duction m\u00eame si aucune facture ou autre documentation n\u2019est produite en preuve au proc\u00e8s. Toutefois, la preuve produite doit autrement \u00eatre fiable et cr\u00e9dible.\n(2) La conclusion de la Cour quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ductibilit\u00e9 des montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s\n[168] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que les montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s ou effectu\u00e9s par SPE dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019entreprise, et ne peuvent donc pas \u00eatre d\u00e9duits dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019entreprise de SPE. Les appelants n\u2019ont produit aucune preuve testimoniale ou documentaire cr\u00e9dible et fiable permettant \u00e0 la Cour de conclure que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines avaient rendu des services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte de SPE, ou encore tout autre type de service \u00e0 SPE, au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n(3) Discussion\n[169] La Cour ne retient pas la th\u00e8se des appelants \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont rendu des services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte de SPE.\n(a) les t\u00e9moignages\n[170] Les appelants ont maintenu devant la Cour qu\u2019Apnet devait \u00eatre responsable du d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 de l\u2019Est am\u00e9ricain, alors que For Impex devait s\u2019occuper du march\u00e9 de l\u2019Ouest am\u00e9ricain. Quant aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s IntroTech et Structured Management, elles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es selon les appelants, pour faire la mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel pour les licenci\u00e9s, M. Gilbert et M. Lessard, respectivement. En ce qui concerne A+Shadow, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour faire la promotion et la vente des licences du progiciel en Am\u00e9rique du Nord selon les appelants. De plus, selon les appelants, A+Shadow rendait des services de consultation, faisait de l\u2019exploitation de biens immobiliers en Floride, s\u2019occupait de vendre et offrir des services de marketing pour divers produits, et faisait la gestion de quelques soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, dont Apnet, For Impex, et SPE Marketing. Finalement, selon les appelants, SPE Marketing aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e afin de s\u2019occuper de l\u2019aspect marketing de la commercialisation du progiciel, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter les produits publicitaires on\u00e9reux, tel Google AdWords (ou Google Ads), qui n\u2019apportaient pas les r\u00e9sultats escompt\u00e9s.\n[171] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pour sa part convenu que SPE faisait des affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis, et que le progiciel existait bel et bien. Ces questions ne sont pas en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[172] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, la Cour conclut plut\u00f4t, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que SPE, et non pas les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, a fait les d\u00e9marches de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les t\u00e9moignages de M. Plante et de M. Mavrovic quant aux activit\u00e9s des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles et ne sont pas retenus par la Cour. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Paquin, informaticien chez SPE de f\u00e9vrier 2004 \u00e0 2006, vient d\u00e9montrer que SPE effectuait les d\u00e9marches de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[173] En effet, M. Paquin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ses fonctions consistaient \u00e0 maintenir le logiciel existant, d\u00e9velopper de nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s, supporter les clients existant au Qu\u00e9bec et au Mexique et faire la mise \u00e0 jour des logiciels. M. Paquin s\u2019occupait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 technique et non pas des ventes. En outre, la Cour retient que M. Plante a fait dix \u00e0 quinze voyages aux \u00c9tats-Unis entre 2003 et 2006, accompagn\u00e9 de M. Mavrovic, ce qui d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que SPE effectuait les activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n(b) les relev\u00e9s bancaires\n[174] L\u2019examen des relev\u00e9s bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement un sc\u00e9nario constant : la majorit\u00e9 du solde au compte est rapidement retir\u00e9, souvent au Qu\u00e9bec, ou encore demeure quelques jours au compte pour \u00eatre retir\u00e9 au guichet bancaire ou par ch\u00e8ques. Les relev\u00e9s bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019indiquent aucune sortie de fonds r\u00e9guli\u00e8re comme le paiement de salaires ou de d\u00e9penses normalement encourues dans le cadre de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise de services. Les comptes bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne font \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune op\u00e9ration autre, qu\u2019en grande partie, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de fonds provenant de SPE et les transferts \u00e0 M. Plante (par ch\u00e8ques, retraits aux guichets bancaires ou paiement de montants au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante) ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n[175] Ainsi, puisqu\u2019aucune somme ne demeurait dans les coffres des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, il est justifi\u00e9 pour la Cour de conclure que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019effectuaient pas d\u2019activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel pour SPE aux \u00c9tats-Unis comme l\u2019ont pr\u00e9tendu les appelants.\n[176] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019examen des relev\u00e9s bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Apnet, For Impex, SPE Marketing et A+Shadow d\u00e9montre, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont exerc\u00e9 que peu d\u2019activit\u00e9, voire aucune activit\u00e9, et n\u2019ont donc pu rendre de services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte de SPE.\n(i) Apnet :\n[177] Les relev\u00e9s bancaires d\u2019Apnet pour les mois de janvier 2004 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2005 (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 30) indiquent que tous les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts au compte d\u2019Apnet totalisant 484 606 $ US proviennent de SPE et que les retraits totalisant 484 296 $ US ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits soit par ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s au nom de M. Plante (399 950 $ US), par retraits au guichet bancaire (24 975 $ US), par ch\u00e8que au nom de Vitrerie Mobile Inc. (2 417 $ US) pour le compte de M. Plante, et par ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 M. Montoya (3 000 $ US) et \u00e0 A+Shadow (2 500 $ US). Toutefois, un retrait au montant de 51 000 $ US n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9.\n[178] En 2006, les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts totalisant 77 301 $ US proviennent tous de SPE (sauf pour 1 500 $ US provenant de A+Shadow) et les retraits totalisant 73 609 $ US ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits soit par ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s au nom de M. Plante ou par retraits au guichet bancaire (24 975 $ US) (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 36). En 2007, seuls des retraits au guichet automatique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s au cours du mois de janvier. Le compte bancaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 en janvier 2008.\n(ii) For Impex :\n[179] Les relev\u00e9s bancaires de For Impex pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 37) indiquent que tous les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts au compte de For Impex pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 totalisant 121 000 $ US proviennent de SPE, et tous les retraits totalisant 121 000 $ US ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s au nom de M. Plante. Ces documents indiquent qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune activit\u00e9 au compte bancaire autre que les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts par SPE et les retraits par ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s au nom de M. Plante.\n[180] Il n\u2019y a aucune activit\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 et ce jusqu\u2019en septembre 2006. Par la suite, il y a tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019activit\u00e9, soit un retrait au guichet bancaire et par ch\u00e8que, jusqu\u2019en novembre 2007 au moment o\u00f9 SPE Marketing fait un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de 93 000 $ US au compte de For Impex. Par la suite, plusieurs retraits au guichet bancaire sont effectu\u00e9s en 2008. Le compte bancaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 en juin 2009 (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 40).\n(iii) SPE Marketing :\n[181] Les relev\u00e9s bancaires de SPE Marketing pour la p\u00e9riode de septembre 2004 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2005 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 43). Au cours de la p\u00e9riode de septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2004, il n\u2019y a aucune activit\u00e9. Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts proviennent en totalit\u00e9 de SPE (182 633 $ US) (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 42) et les retraits totalisant 179 812 $ US ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 plusieurs personnes qui avaient pr\u00eat\u00e9 des fonds \u00e0 SPE, ou bien \u00e0 M.

Quant aux retraits totalisant 327 000 $ US, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M.

Les relev\u00e9s bancaires ne peuvent donc pas servir d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve faisant \u00e9tat du niveau d\u2019activit\u00e9s de ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. La Cour note \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard ayant indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il utilisait la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Structured Management dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s d\u2019importations de composantes de portes et fen\u00eatres et d\u2019activit\u00e9s de d\u00e9marchage en Asie.\n[186] Les relev\u00e9s bancaires de Structured Management pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019aout 2007 \u00e0 juillet 2010 font \u00e9tat de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts totalisant 110 000 $ US provenant de SPE Marketing (vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment), un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de SPE totalisant 8 975 $ US, et un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de SPE Affacturage totalisant 22 637 $ US (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 50).\n[187] Les relev\u00e9s bancaires de IntroTech pour la p\u00e9riode de f\u00e9vrier 2006 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2010 d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019il y a beaucoup d\u2019activit\u00e9s au compte (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 53).

Plante autorisait le transfert des sommes de SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, et SPE r\u00e9clamait la d\u00e9pense en d\u00e9duction dans le calcul de son revenu. Par la suite, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines faisaient des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Plante (la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des ch\u00e8ques ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 encaiss\u00e9s par M. Baillargeon et les fonds remis \u00e0 M.

Plusieurs transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE ainsi que les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines (et donc les sorties de fonds) sont dat\u00e9s de la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, ou sont espac\u00e9s de quelques jours seulement.\n[191] Ainsi, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, Apnet a pay\u00e9 2 417,64 $ \u00e0 Vitrerie Mobile pour le remplacement des vitres des fen\u00eatres de la r\u00e9sidence de M. Plante (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 31, p. 564).\n[192] M. Plante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle M. Baillargeon encaissait les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9tait due au fait que le d\u00e9lai d\u2019encaissement \u00e9tait trop long \u00e0 sa propre banque, soit d\u2019un \u00e0 deux mois. La Cour ne retient pas la version des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Plante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, M. Potvin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai d\u2019encaissement \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t de 6 ou 18 jours.\n[193] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Jalil envoyait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 M. Mavrovic des ch\u00e8ques des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, sign\u00e9s en blanc. Par exemple, par courriel dat\u00e9 du 28 avril 2004, M. Mavrovic a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Jalil de lui faire parvenir des ch\u00e8ques, sign\u00e9s en blanc au nom de Apnet ainsi que des ch\u00e8ques au nom de IntroTech (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 72 et 76). De plus, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Jalil envoyait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des ch\u00e8ques sign\u00e9s en blanc \u00e0 M. Mavrovic pour que ce dernier les remette \u00e0 M. Plante; M. Plante a \u00e9galement admis avoir eu en sa possession une carte de guichet bancaire qu\u2019il utilisait pour ses besoins personnels.\n[194] La Cour retient donc la preuve suivante pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience par M. Potvin quant aux transferts (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 308 et 309).\n(i) Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2004 :\n[195] SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 367 084 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes, soit 235 326 $ US \u00e0 Apnet, 121 058 $ US \u00e0 For Impex et 10 700 $ US \u00e0 A+Shadow.\n[196] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que quelques jours apr\u00e8s les divers transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE, des sommes quasi \u00e9quivalentes sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante.\n[197] Apnet a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Plante totalisant 168 652,93 $ US (incluant des paiements \u00e0 Motopro totalisant 7 382,93 $ US) dans les quelques jours suivants la r\u00e9ception des fonds de SPE totalisant 235 326 $. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pu obtenir la copie d\u2019un ch\u00e8que \u00e9mis par Apnet au montant de 50 000 $ US.\n[198] For Impex a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Plante totalisant 121 000 $ US dans les jours suivant la r\u00e9ception des fonds de SPE totalisant 121 058 $ US.\n[199] A+Shadow a \u00e9mis un ch\u00e8que au montant de 10 700 $ US quelques jours apr\u00e8s le transfert des fonds provenant de SPE au m\u00eame montant; l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a toutefois pas obtenu copie du ch\u00e8que.\n[200] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 par M. Potvin \u00e0 l\u2019audience, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2004, ce dernier n\u2019a pu retracer l\u2019utilisation de fonds totalisant 60 660 $ US (10 700 $ US transf\u00e9r\u00e9 par SPE \u00e0 A+Shadow, et les deux transferts de 24 980 $ US effectu\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 Apnet). Toutefois, la Cour conclut qu\u2019il est raisonnable d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que le ch\u00e8que de 50 000 $ US \u00e9mis par Apnet quelques jours apr\u00e8s les transferts a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis au nom de M. Plante, compte tenu de l\u2019historique des retraits effectu\u00e9s au compte bancaire d\u2019Apnet au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, les retraits \u00e9tant tous effectu\u00e9s par ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de M. Plante.\n[201] Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la Cour conclut que le transfert effectu\u00e9 en faveur de A+Shadow a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante.\n(ii) Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2005 :\n[202] SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 440 853 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes, soit 249 880 $ US \u00e0 Apnet et 190 973 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing.\n[203] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que quelques jours apr\u00e8s les divers transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 Apnet au cours des mois de f\u00e9vrier et mars 2005, des sommes quasi \u00e9quivalentes sont pay\u00e9es par Apnet \u00e0 M. Plante sous forme de ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis \u00e0 M. Plante (incluant un ch\u00e8que pour payer MotoPro pour 1 752,40 $ US), par retraits aux guichets bancaires \u00e0 St-Georges de Beauce et Montr\u00e9al, en paiement \u00e0 Vitrerie Mobile (2 417,64 $ US) et par ch\u00e8que \u00e9mis \u00e0 M. Baillargeon (30 000 $ US), pour un montant total d\u2019environ 257 855 $ US.\n[204] La preuve a \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que quelques jours apr\u00e8s les divers transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 SPE Marketing, des sommes quasi \u00e9quivalentes sont pay\u00e9es par SPE Marketing \u00e0 diverses personnes sous forme de ch\u00e8ques : \u00e0 Yves Lapointe (ch\u00e8que no 102 pour 25 000 $ US), Alain Baillargeon (ch\u00e8que no 103 pour 25 000 $ US), Gilles Tanguay (ch\u00e8que no 101 pour 50 000 $ US), Bruno Baillargeon (ch\u00e8que no 104 pour 50 000 $ US), Robert Baillargeon (ch\u00e8que no 105 pour 15 000 $ US), M. Letarte (plusieurs ch\u00e8ques de 600 $ US), et JY Design (3 312,50 $ US).\n[205] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que vers les mois de f\u00e9vrier et mars 2005, plusieurs personnes avaient pr\u00eat\u00e9 des fonds \u00e0 SPE. Par la suite, SPE avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 SPE Marketing, qui a alors rembours\u00e9 les divers pr\u00eateurs en mars 2005. Les pr\u00eats ne seront radi\u00e9s par SPE qu\u2019en 2007 (voir la pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 13, 14, 43 et 44).\n(iii) Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2006 :\n[206] SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 155 192 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes, soit 75 800 $ US \u00e0 Apnet et 79 392 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing.\n[207] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que quelques jours apr\u00e8s les divers transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE, des sommes quasi \u00e9quivalentes sont pay\u00e9s par Apnet et SPE Marketing \u00e0 M. Plante sous forme de ch\u00e8ques \u00e9mis \u00e0 M. Plante et par retraits aux guichets bancaires \u00e0 St-Georges de Beauce et Montr\u00e9al, pour un montant totalisant 153 427 $ US.\n(iv) Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2007 :\n[208] SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 214 189 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing.\n[209] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que quelques jours apr\u00e8s les divers transferts provenant de SPE, des retraits aux guichets bancaires \u00e0 St-Georges de Beauce et \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s pour un montant totalisant 6 337 $ US.\n[210] De plus, SPE Marketing a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques totalisant 205 037 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes : 110 537 $ US \u00e0 Structured Management, 93 000 $ US \u00e0 For Impex et 1 500 $ US \u00e0 A+Shadow.\n(v) Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile 2008 :\n[211] SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 69 473 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes : 31 612 $ US \u00e0 Structured Management, 10 963 $ US \u00e0 IntroTech, 25 910 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing et 988 $ US \u00e0 For Impex.\n[212] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que des retraits aux guichets bancaires totalisant 7 125 $ US ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 St-Georges de Beauce provenant du compte de SPE Marketing. En ce qui concerne un montant total de 56 533 $ US, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ayant re\u00e7u les fonds de SPE n\u2019ont pas \u00e9mis de ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 M. Plante. Plut\u00f4t, des retraits aux guichets bancaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s ou des ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n(d) autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve\n[213] Comme indiqu\u00e9 auparavant, les appelants n\u2019ont produit aucune preuve documentaire cr\u00e9dible et fiable d\u00e9montrant que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont rendu des services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte de SPE.\n[214] Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Mavrovic devait avoir les factures, puisque les factures auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines g\u00e9r\u00e9es par M. Mavrovic. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, M. Mavrovic n\u2019a toutefois produit aucune facture. Les seules factures produites par les appelants sont truff\u00e9es d\u2019erreurs et pr\u00e9par\u00e9es sous le m\u00eame format.\n[215] Par courriel dat\u00e9 du 29 mars 2005 (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 91), M. Mavrovic a fait parvenir \u00e0 Mme Maryse Gosselin une facture \u00e9mise par Apnet \u00e0 SPE et une facture \u00e9mise par A+Shadow \u00e0 SPE : ces deux factures portent la m\u00eame date (31 janvier 2004) et le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro (num\u00e9ro 43); elles contiennent des erreurs grossi\u00e8res (r\u00e9f\u00e8rent aux services pour les mois d\u2019octobre, novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2004); de m\u00eame, la facture \u00e9mise par Apnet r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux services pour les mois d\u2019octobre, de novembre et de d\u00e9cembre 2004, alors que le terme de la convention est le 1er octobre 2004; \u00e9galement, la facture \u00e9mise par Apnet inclut des frais de repr\u00e9sentation, alors que selon l\u2019article 20 de la convention de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale (discut\u00e9e ci-dessous), toutes les d\u00e9penses de repr\u00e9sentation seraient \u00e0 la charge d\u2019Apnet.\n[216] Pour les motifs suivants, l\u2019examen des six conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale entre SPE et Apnet, entre SPE et M. Letarte et entre SPE et SPE Marketing (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 8, en liasse) ne permet pas non plus \u00e0 la Cour de conclure que les montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s par SPE dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019entreprise. En effet, comme l\u2019a plaid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019utilit\u00e9 commerciale de ces conventions est douteuse.\n[217] Tout d\u2019abord, les appelants ont pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la mise en place de la structure et la signature de l\u2019entente initiale, le travail des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines d\u00e9butait. Celles-ci devaient trouver des agents charg\u00e9s de faire la promotion et de trouver des entreprises qui seraient int\u00e9ress\u00e9es d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir le progiciel. Le processus \u00e9tait relativement simple, les agents identifiant des clients potentiels, faisant les premi\u00e8res approches et SPE prenant la rel\u00e8ve pour le c\u00f4t\u00e9 technique et les n\u00e9gociations de prix de vente (observations additionnelles des appelants dat\u00e9es d\u2019octobre 2023, p. 5).\n[218] Toutefois, cette fa\u00e7on de voir les choses ne peut \u00eatre retenue par la Cour puisqu\u2019entre autres, les conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale pr\u00e9voyaient que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines devaient engager des employ\u00e9s pour faire le travail, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019avaient aucun employ\u00e9 alors que les conventions pr\u00e9voyaient que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines devaient employer des vendeurs. De plus, l\u2019examen des relev\u00e9s bancaires effectu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9montre l\u2019absence de sommes payables \u00e0 titre de salaires.\n[219] Les conventions pr\u00e9voyaient \u00e9galement que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines devaient fournir une liste des personnes contact\u00e9es, mais aucune telle liste n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience. De plus, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines devaient fournir des rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel \u00e0 SPE, mais les quelques rapports produits en preuve ne sont pas convaincants.\n[220] Les conventions contiennent beaucoup d\u2019erreurs et il est impossible de concilier les montants qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au cours des ann\u00e9es par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. \u00c0 ce titre, M. Plante a reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de concilier tous les paiements effectu\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas toutes les pi\u00e8ces justificatives.\n[221] M. Mavrovic a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les transferts aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e9taient faits par SPE de fa\u00e7on sporadique, selon la capacit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re de SPE. Cependant, aucun travail de corr\u00e9lation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les appelants pour d\u00e9montrer en vertu de quelle convention les sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Les paiements qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par SPE en vertu des conventions totalisent 1 079 515 $, alors que les transferts r\u00e9ellement effectu\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines totalisent 1 526 143 $ (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 308).\n[222] Les appelants ont soutenu que, par la suite, et \u00e0 compter de f\u00e9vrier 2005, d\u2019autres conventions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conclues entre SPE et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Cependant, ils ne produiront qu\u2019une seule convention entre SPE et M. Letarte dat\u00e9e du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2005 visant le territoire de la Nouvelle-Angleterre, en vertu de laquelle M. Letarte aurait droit \u00e0 une avance de 600 $ US par semaine pour un maximum de 26 semaines, en cas d\u2019insuffisance des ventes (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 8, p. 1).\n[223] Les autres conventions produites en preuve entre SPE et Apnet et entre SPE et SPE Marketing dat\u00e9es de f\u00e9vrier 2005 ne sont pas sign\u00e9es par SPE. En plus, les appelants ont produit deux conventions sign\u00e9es au nom d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine par des personnes diff\u00e9rentes, et r\u00e9gies par des lois d\u2019\u00e9tats diff\u00e9rents, mais couvrant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode et le m\u00eame territoire.\n[224] Les appelants ont mis la Cour en garde de ne pas analyser la perspicacit\u00e9 commerciale de SPE et de M. Plante de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9trospective, mais ce n\u2019est pas ce que la Cour a fait. Selon les appelants, en 2002 et 2003, SPE et M. Plante esp\u00e9raient qu\u2019il y aurait des ventes du progiciel et la mise en place de la structure am\u00e9ricaine ne faisait que permettre les activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel sur le sol am\u00e9ricain. Toutefois, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que d\u00e8s 2004, le march\u00e9 du logiciel se dirigeait vers le logiciel bas\u00e9 sur le web et non pas un logiciel bas\u00e9 sur un serveur, comme le progiciel. Les fonds ont cependant continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre vers\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines apr\u00e8s 2004. En 2005, SPE a m\u00eame conclu d\u2019autres conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale.\n[225] La preuve a aussi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019avaient aucun employ\u00e9, et ni aucune adresse ou place d\u2019affaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[226] De plus, par courriel dat\u00e9 du 5 mai 2006, M. Mavrovic a avis\u00e9 M. Letarte que ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019op\u00e9raient pas et n\u2019\u00e9taient redevables d\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 102), leur but \u00e9tant d\u2019investir dans l\u2019immobilier et des \u00ab capital ventures \u00bb.\n(e) le cas particulier des licenci\u00e9s\n[227] En ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement les montants pay\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 IntroTech (11 197 $ en 2008) et \u00e0 Structured Management (9 154 $ en 2008 et 25 030 $ en 2009), les appelants ont pr\u00e9tendu que ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es pour effectuer les activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel de SPE aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte des licenci\u00e9s, soit M. Gilbert et M. Lessard, respectivement.\n[228] L\u2019examen de la preuve documentaire ne permet pas \u00e0 la Cour de retenir la version des faits des appelants relativement \u00e0 ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Ainsi, en plus des motifs expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les motifs suivants s\u2019ajoutent aux raisons pour lesquelles la Cour en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que les montants transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 IntroTech et \u00e0 Structured Management ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9duits dans le calcul du revenu d\u2019entreprise de SPE.\n[229] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Mavrovic et M. Gilbert \u00e9taient actionnaires de IntroTech, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres personnes. La preuve a \u00e9galement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Mavrovic et M. Lessard \u00e9taient actionnaires de Structured Management, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres personnes.\n[230] Un contrat de licence, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un billet et une convention de commercialisation entre SPE et M. Gilbert (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 287 et 291, et pi\u00e8ce I-4, Convention de commercialisation (\u00c9ric Gilbert)) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. \u00c9galement, les divers contrats et billets, ainsi que les copies des ch\u00e8ques \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre SPE et M. Lessard ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve par l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Lessard ayant acquis 9 licences de territoires entre la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2002 et l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 (voir pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 126, 127, 128, 130, 136, 137, 139, 140, et pi\u00e8ce I-3, Convention de commercialisation (Claude Lessard)).\n[231] Un document expliquant le processus de ventes des licences territoriales a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 63, courriel de M. Mavrovic \u00e0 M. Plante, dat\u00e9 du 28 aout 2003; \u00e9galement l\u2019onglet 64 pour le courriel dat\u00e9 du 23 novembre 2003).\n[232] Un courriel de M. Mavrovic dat\u00e9 du 9 avril 2003 explique le flux mon\u00e9taire de ce programme pour les parties impliqu\u00e9es (pi\u00e8ce I-6, liste suppl\u00e9mentaire de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 24). En pi\u00e8ce jointe \u00e0 ce courriel, on y retrouve \u00e9galement le d\u00e9tail du syst\u00e8me des licences territoriales, et des exemplaires des contrats types du contrat de licence, du billet \u00e0 ordre constatant le pr\u00eat par SPE au licenci\u00e9, et de la convention de commercialisation.\n[233] Lors de l\u2019acquisition d\u2019une licence de territoire au prix de 40 000 $ payable par le licenci\u00e9 \u00e0 SPE, SPE consentait au licenci\u00e9 un pr\u00eat au montant de 24 000 $ (ou 26 000 $ selon l\u2019ann\u00e9e), tel que constat\u00e9 par un billet \u00e0 ordre au m\u00eame montant \u00e9mis par le licenci\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de SPE, dont l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tait de 10 ans. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que la dette constat\u00e9e par le billet \u00e0 ordre se payait \u00e0 m\u00eame les revenus provenant de la vente de licences du progiciel. Le licenci\u00e9 obtenait un revenu annuel garanti de 2 700 $ pendant dix (10) ans. Le licenci\u00e9 ne d\u00e9boursait en fait que 16 000 $ au moment de l\u2019acquisition de la licence. De plus, le licenci\u00e9 obtenait des avantages fiscaux, soit une d\u00e9duction pour amortissement au taux de 125% au Qu\u00e9bec et 30% au f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, repr\u00e9sentant un remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4t d\u2019environ 22 840 $.\n[234] Cette licence de territoire octroyait au licenci\u00e9 des droits non exclusifs de vendre des licences du progiciel dans un territoire donn\u00e9. Selon M. Plante, la raison pour laquelle des droits non exclusifs \u00e9taient octroy\u00e9s aux licenci\u00e9s, \u00e9tait que les licenci\u00e9s ne connaissaient pas le progiciel et cela permettait donc \u00e0 SPE de continuer \u00e0 s\u2019impliquer dans le d\u00e9veloppement du march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain. \u00c9galement, selon M. Plante, il faut interpr\u00e9ter ces contrats en tenant compte du fait que les licenci\u00e9s participaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans l\u2019entreprise de SPE, soit par l\u2019entremise de la SPEQ ou en \u00e9tant directement actionnaires de SPE. La Cour ne retient pas ce t\u00e9moignage de M. Plante.\n[235] De plus, dans le cadre de l\u2019acquisition de la licence de territoire, le licenci\u00e9 et SPE concluaient une convention de commercialisation par laquelle le licenci\u00e9 remettait \u00e0 SPE le droit exclusif de commercialiser, distribuer et mettre en march\u00e9 sur le territoire vis\u00e9 par la licence le progiciel pour une p\u00e9riode de 10 ans, renouvelable automatiquement pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode (articles 1 et 2). Selon cette convention, il \u00e9tait entendu que SPE remettait 5% des revenus provenant de la vente du progiciel au licenci\u00e9.\n[236] Le contrat de licence de territoire et le billet \u00e0 ordre \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 la convention de commercialisation et joints en annexe \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. \u00c9galement, SPE s\u2019engageait \u00e0 transmettre aux licenci\u00e9s un rapport \u00e9crit annuel des activit\u00e9s de commercialisation effectu\u00e9es sur leurs territoires.\n[237] Tout d\u2019abord, comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Mavrovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les licenci\u00e9s allaient recevoir des commissions de 20% sur les ventes du progiciel et 10% sur les services; toutefois, les conventions de commercialisation pr\u00e9voyaient plut\u00f4t que les licenci\u00e9s recevaient 5% des revenus bruts.\n[238] De plus, en vertu des contrats de licences, aucune redevance n\u2019\u00e9tait payable par le licenci\u00e9 \u00e0 SPE lorsque le licenci\u00e9 effectuait une vente du progiciel, ce qui est inhabituel dans ce type de convention. Selon l\u2019article 5.1, le licenci\u00e9 faisait un paiement de 40 000 $ \u00e0 SPE, et par la suite, tous les profits provenant des ventes demeuraient entre les mains des licenci\u00e9s (voir la pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 126).\n[239] En outre, la convention de commercialisation pr\u00e9voyait que le licenci\u00e9 remettait \u00e0 SPE les droits exclusifs de commercialisation du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[240] Les tableaux produits par les appelants \u00e0 titre de rapport des efforts effectu\u00e9s sur le sol am\u00e9ricain (\u00ab Detailed Sales Management Pipeline \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglets 33 et 41) et deux comptes rendus financiers (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 58)) ne sont pas dat\u00e9s, aucun territoire n\u2019est indiqu\u00e9 et ne mentionnent qu\u2019une vingtaine de clients potentiels. En ce qui concerne les cinq tableaux, deux sont identiques (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 33, pp. 1 et 2); le troisi\u00e8me est quasi identique aux deux autres (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 33 p. 5 et onglet 41, p. 1, versus onglet 33, p. 4). Donc, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il n\u2019y a que deux tableaux (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 33, pp. 1 et 5).\n[241] De plus, les comptes rendus financiers sont incompr\u00e9hensibles, et ni M. Plante et ni M. Mavrovic ne peuvent fournir d\u2019explications \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard.\n[242] En outre, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les billets \u00e9mis par les licenci\u00e9s \u00e0 SPE ne seront jamais pay\u00e9s.\n[243] L\u2019utilit\u00e9 commerciale de ces contrats semble douteuse. Il est donc fort improbable que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s IntroTech et Structured Management aient effectu\u00e9 des activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les appelants.\n[244] \u00c9galement, la Cour note que M. Gilbert, le licenci\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice duquel IntroTech aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e, n\u2019a pas livr\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9 aux raisons pour lesquelles SPE aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Structured Management les sommes totalisant 9 154 $ en 2008 et 25 030 $ en 2009, dont la d\u00e9duction a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 SPE.\n[245] Selon M. Lessard, les activit\u00e9s de Structured Management incluaient non seulement les activit\u00e9s relatives aux licences, mais beaucoup d\u2019activit\u00e9s reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019importation pour gagner des parts de march\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis et la recherche de manufacturiers en Asie pour les composantes de portes et fen\u00eatres.\n[246] Selon M. Lessard, SPE aurait pay\u00e9 Structured Management pour des services d\u2019installation du progiciel vendu par SPE \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 California Closets en 2006. Les services d\u2019installation auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Structured Management aux bureaux de California Closets situ\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. Une facture \u00e9mise par SPE \u00e0 California Closet a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 12, p. 21, facture \u00e9mise par SPE \u00e0 California Closets dat\u00e9e du 31 mars 2006). SPE aurait ainsi vendu 3 licences du progiciel, la formation ainsi que les services d\u2019installation cl\u00e9 en main pour un total de 60 000 $.\n[247] M. Lessard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Structured Management a \u00e9mis une facture \u00e0 SPE pour les services rendus pour l\u2019installation du progiciel, mais il n\u2019a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de produire la facture \u00e0 l\u2019audition. \u00c9galement, SPE n\u2019a pas fourni de factures pour justifier le paiement de ces montants.\n[248] Vu l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, vu que les paiements pour les pr\u00e9tendus services rendus par Structured Management ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par SPE plus de deux ans apr\u00e8s la vente du progiciel \u00e0 California Closets, et vu l\u2019absence de preuve documentaire d\u00e9montrant la nature des paiements faits par SPE, la Cour ne retient pas cette partie du t\u00e9moignage de M. Lessard. La Cour n\u2019est pas convaincue que les sommes vers\u00e9es par SPE \u00e0 Structured Management ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es en contrepartie de services rendus pour l\u2019installation du progiciel.\n[249] De plus, les documents de transferts indiquent que les sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par SPE \u00e0 Structured Management sont des \u00ab frais de marketing \u00bb, ce qui n\u2019est pas de la m\u00eame nature que des frais d\u2019installation.\n[250] De m\u00eame, au cours du proc\u00e8s, les appelants ont pr\u00e9tendu que SPE fournissait les services techniques aux acqu\u00e9reurs du progiciel, comme l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 M. Paquin. Alors, pourquoi est-ce que Structured Management aurait fourni des services d\u2019installation du progiciel \u00e0 un client de SPE? Cela est plut\u00f4t invraisemblable.\n[251] Ainsi, compte tenu de la preuve documentaire, de m\u00eame que les t\u00e9moignages non cr\u00e9dibles de M. Plante et M. Mavrovic, la Cour conclut, pour les fins des pr\u00e9sents appels seulement, qu\u2019IntroTech et que Structured Management n\u2019ont pas effectu\u00e9 d\u2019activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour les licenci\u00e9s, M. Gilbert et M. Lessard respectivement. Selon cette preuve documentaire, vu l\u2019existence des licences non exclusives et vu les conventions de commercialisation, la Cour conclut que SPE faisait les d\u00e9marches de mise en march\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis et non pas les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[252] Cette conclusion est \u00e9galement support\u00e9e par le fait que les licenci\u00e9s ne connaissaient pas le progiciel et ne pouvaient donc pas, par le biais de leurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, faire les activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis, comme l\u2019ont soutenu les appelants.\nC. Les appels log\u00e9s par M. Plante : alin\u00e9a 18(1)a) pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 et paragraphe 56(2) pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008\n(1) L\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003 : le Ramjet\n[253] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour conclut que le montant de 13 128 $ (10 000 $ US) r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en d\u00e9duction par M. Plante dans le calcul de son revenu relativement au d\u00e9veloppement du Ramjet n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9pense d\u00e9ductible dans le calcul du revenu de M. Plante pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e ou effectu\u00e9e par M. Plante en vue de tirer un revenu d\u2019entreprise ou de bien, tel que requis par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a). Les m\u00eames principes que ceux discut\u00e9s ci-dessus concernant SPE \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du paragraphe 9(1) et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 18(1)a) sont applicables.\n[254] Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante a admis n\u2019avoir jamais vers\u00e9 cette somme \u00e0 Apnet. \u00c9galement, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, M. Plante a admis qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est jamais occup\u00e9 du Ramjet.\n(2) Les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008 : le paragraphe 56(2)\n[255] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des montants totalisant 1 526 144 $ de son compte bancaire aux comptes bancaires des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines suivant les instructions de M. Plante, dans le but pour M. Plante de s\u2019approprier ces fonds pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel ou d\u2019avantager certaines connaissances. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Plante aurait d\u00fb inclure ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu du paragraphe 15(1) si le paiement de ces montants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait directement par SPE \u00e0 M. Plante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que toutes les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 56(2) sont r\u00e9unies. Cons\u00e9quemment, M. Plante devrait ainsi ajouter la totalit\u00e9 de ces montants dans le calcul de son revenu.\n[256] Le paragraphe 56(2) se lit ainsi :\n56(2) Tout paiement ou transfert de biens fait, suivant les instructions ou avec l\u2019accord d\u2019un contribuable, \u00e0 une autre personne au profit du contribuable ou \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage que le contribuable d\u00e9sirait voir accorder \u00e0 l\u2019autre personne \u2014 sauf la cession d\u2019une partie d\u2019une pension de retraite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 65.1 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada ou \u00e0 une disposition comparable d\u2019un r\u00e9gime provincial de pensions au sens de l\u2019article 3 de cette loi \u2014 est inclus dans le calcul du revenu du contribuable dans la mesure o\u00f9 il le serait si ce paiement ou transfert avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au contribuable.\n56(2) A payment or transfer of property made pursuant to the direction of, or with the concurrence of, a taxpayer to another person for the benefit of the taxpayer or as a benefit that the taxpayer desired to have conferred on the other person (other than by an assignment of any portion of a retirement pension under section 65.1 of the Canada Pension Plan or a comparable provision of a provincial pension plan as defined in section 3 of that Act) shall be included in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income to the extent that it would be if the payment or transfer had been made to the taxpayer.\n[257] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuman c. MRN, [1998] 1 RCS 770 [Neuman], a indiqu\u00e9 que quatre conditions doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies pour que le paragraphe 56(2) re\u00e7oive application :\n32. Le paragraphe 56(2) \u00e9nonce dans son libell\u00e9 m\u00eame les quatre conditions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 son application:\n(1) le paiement doit \u00eatre fait \u00e0 une autre personne que le contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie;\n(2) la r\u00e9partition doit \u00eatre faite suivant les instructions ou avec l\u2019accord du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie;\n(3) le paiement doit \u00eatre fait au profit du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie ou \u00e0 une autre personne \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage que ce contribuable souhaitait voir accorder \u00e0 cette autre personne;\n(4) le paiement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le revenu du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie si ce dernier l\u2019avait re\u00e7u lui-m\u00eame.\n[258] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour les motifs suivants, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la Cour conclut que les quatre conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 56(2) telles qu\u2019\u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuman, sont remplies et donc, que la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre maintenue. En vertu du paragraphe 56(2), M. Plante doit inclure dans le calcul de son revenu pour les ann\u00e9es pertinentes les montants ainsi transf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n(a) le paiement doit \u00eatre fait \u00e0 une autre personne que le contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie\n[259] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que des montants totalisant 1 526 144 $ ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines au cours des ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008, soit \u00e0 Apnet, A+Shadow, For Impex, SPE Marketing, Structured Management et IntroTech (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 308). Ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ne sont pas les contribuables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels la nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire M. Plante. Ainsi, cette premi\u00e8re condition est remplie.\n(b) la r\u00e9partition doit \u00eatre faite suivant les instructions ou avec l\u2019accord du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie\n[260] Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante a admis avoir autoris\u00e9 les transferts de fonds aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 titre de frais de marketing ou \u00ab marketing fees \u00bb (transcriptions du 31 octobre 2017, p. 98, interrogatoire de M. Plante, et pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 23 et 26). Ainsi, la seconde condition est remplie.\n(c) le paiement doit \u00eatre fait au profit du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie ou \u00e0 une autre personne \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage que ce contribuable souhaitait voir accorder \u00e0 cette autre personne\n[261] Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019aucun avantage au sens du paragraphe 56(2) n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 quiconque puisque les transferts effectu\u00e9s par SPE sont de v\u00e9ritables op\u00e9rations commerciales, ayant servi \u00e0 payer la contrepartie des services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel fournis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 SPE. La Cour ne retient pas cette pr\u00e9tention des appelants, puisqu\u2019elle a conclu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019ont fourni aucun service de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel \u00e0 SPE en contrepartie des fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s. N\u2019ayant fourni aucun service de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel \u00e0 SPE, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont donc b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un avantage que M. Plante souhaitait leur voir accorder.\n[262] Selon les appelants, les pr\u00eats effectu\u00e9s par la suite par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines Apnet, For Impex et SPE Marketing au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante \u00e9tant de v\u00e9ritables pr\u00eats, ceux-ci ne peuvent constituer des transferts ou des avantages au sens du paragraphe 56(2). Encore une fois, pour les raisons suivantes, la Cour ne retient pas cette position des appelants.\n[263] L\u2019objet du paragraphe 56(2) est le suivant :\n\u00ab Ce paragraphe vise manifestement \u00e0 emp\u00eacher le contribuable d'\u00e9viter le paiement de l'imp\u00f4t en versant \u00e0 un tiers les recettes qu'il aurait autrement touch\u00e9es. \u2026.. on ne peut raisonnablement croire que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu que cette disposition s'applique aux avantages conf\u00e9r\u00e9s moyennant une contrepartie suffisante dans le cadre d'une relation d'affaires l\u00e9gitime. \u00bb Mcclurg c. Canada [1990] 3 RCS 1020 [Mcclurg] (au par. 41)\n[264] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuman, au paragraphe 48, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau l\u2019objet du paragraphe 56(2) en reprenant ce passage pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mcclurg.\n[265] Le terme \u00ab avantage \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fini sp\u00e9cifiquement au paragraphe 56(2), mais les commentaires de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Winter c. Canada, [1991] 1 CF 585 [Winter] sont utiles pour cerner les op\u00e9rations vis\u00e9es par ce paragraphe. Ainsi, selon la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le paragraphe 56(2) est fond\u00e9 sur la doctrine de la recette pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e et :\n\u00ab \u2026vise principalement les cas o\u00f9 le contribuable cherche \u00e0 \u00e9viter de recevoir ce qui serait, entre ses mains, un revenu en s\u2019arrangeant pour que le montant soit vers\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, et ce pour son propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice (par exemple, pour \u00e9teindre une dette) ou pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette autre personne \u2026 \u00bb (au par. 14).\n[266] \u00c9galement, il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que dans l\u2019affaire GlaxoSmithKline Inc. c. La Reine, 2008 CCI 324 (par. 167), la Cour a conclu que puisque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans cette affaire avait obtenu quelque chose en ne donnant rien en \u00e9change, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un avantage au sens du paragraphe 56(2), et ce, m\u00eame si, dans ce cas, cet avantage consistait en une perte moindre plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice net.\n[267] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ayant conclu que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019avaient pas rendu de services de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le compte de SPE, la seule conclusion \u00e0 laquelle la Cour peut arriver est que M. Plante a voulu conf\u00e9rer un avantage aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. En effet, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont re\u00e7u un avantage puisqu\u2019elles ont re\u00e7u des sommes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es par SPE sans fournir quelque contrepartie que ce soit.\n[268] En outre, la Cour conclut qu\u2019en plus de vouloir avantager les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, M. Plante a voulu s\u2019avantager lui-m\u00eame, puisque l\u2019examen des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve accept\u00e9s par la Cour dans ces dossiers ne permet pas de conclure que des pr\u00eats v\u00e9ritables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consentis par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante.\n[269] Tout d\u2019abord, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en janvier 2007 que des billets dat\u00e9s de 2004 sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 105), et c\u2019est au m\u00eame moment, en janvier 2007, que Mme Drew se pr\u00e9sente chez SPE pour effectuer la v\u00e9rification des affaires de SPE et de M. Plante.\n[270] \u00c9galement, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ni M. Plante et ni M. Mavrovic ne peuvent confirmer le montant exact des sommes substantielles suppos\u00e9ment pr\u00eat\u00e9es par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. M. Plante ne conservait aucun registre des fonds pr\u00eat\u00e9s et M. Mavrovic, qui devait maintenir un tel registre selon M. Plante, n\u2019a produit aucun registre en preuve.\n[271] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 9 septembre 2012 envoy\u00e9e par A+Shadow et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Plante et \u00e0 SPE, un solde des pr\u00eats all\u00e9gu\u00e9s est \u00e9tabli tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 606 740,36 $ US (pi\u00e8ce A-1, documents des appelants, onglet 7). En appui \u00e0 cette lettre, A+Shadow ne fournit que la copie de deux billets \u00e0 ordre totalisant 374 240 $ US : un billet au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Forimpex (l\u2019orthographe du nom est erron\u00e9e et semble r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne et non \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine For Impex) pour 96 000 $ US payable le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2007 et un billet au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019Apnet pour 278 240 $ US payable le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2008. Selon ces documents, les pr\u00eats seraient garantis par les actions de SPE et porteraient int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 8%. Toutefois, M. Potvin aurait estim\u00e9 que les sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Plante par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e9taient d\u2019au moins 714 397,08 $ US, ou approximativement 877 808 $ (voir pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 308).\n[272] La Cour ne voit aucune raison valable pour laquelle les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pr\u00eateraient des fonds \u00e0 M. Plante, si elles devaient s\u2019occuper des activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic, il est tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteux de d\u00e9velopper le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain, mais les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ne conservaient que des sommes nominales dans leurs comptes bancaires, apr\u00e8s avoir transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les fonds \u00e0 M. Plante, quelques jours apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception des fonds de SPE. Comment les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pouvaient-elles alors savoir que les fonds ne seraient pas requis pour payer leurs employ\u00e9s (les conventions de repr\u00e9sentation commerciale requ\u00e9rant l\u2019embauche d\u2019employ\u00e9s pour les activit\u00e9s de mise en march\u00e9) ou pour toutes d\u00e9penses qui seraient normalement encourues dans le cadre de leurs activit\u00e9s?\n[273] La preuve (telle que d\u00e9taill\u00e9e aux paragraphes 194 et suivants des pr\u00e9sents motifs) a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les fonds provenant de SPE ne demeuraient que quelques jours dans les coffres des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines avant d\u2019\u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Plante (pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglet 309) ou d\u2019\u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n[274] \u00c9galement, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, bien qu\u2019\u00e9tant cr\u00e9anci\u00e8res de sommes importantes, n\u2019ont jamais demand\u00e9 le remboursement des sommes dues (capital ou des int\u00e9r\u00eats), ni ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 leurs garanties, soit la saisie des actions de SPE. Jusqu\u2019en 2017, au moment de l\u2019audition des appels au m\u00e9rite sur le fond, aucune mesure n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour prot\u00e9ger leurs cr\u00e9ances. Ces faits d\u00e9montrent \u00e9galement l\u2019invraisemblance de l\u2019existence de pr\u00eats entre les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines et M. Plante.\n[275] La Cour ne retient pas le nantissement d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance-vie \u00e9mise le 20 mars 2017, tout juste avant l\u2019audition des appels, comme d\u00e9montrant l\u2019existence des pr\u00eats.\n[276] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la seule conclusion \u00e0 laquelle la Cour peut arriver est la suivante : les pr\u00eats all\u00e9gu\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas, et M. Plante a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses dans le calcul du revenu de SPE afin de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ces sommes d\u2019argent libres d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour ses besoins au Canada. Vu les faits pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment indiqu\u00e9s, la Cour arrive \u00e0 cette m\u00eame conclusion.\n[277] En ce qui concerne les fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement par celles-ci \u00e0 M. Plante, ceux-ci totalisent environ 648 335 $ ou 607 717 $ au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente (selon le taux de change utilis\u00e9) (voir pi\u00e8ce I-1, documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9, onglets 308 et 309). La Cour conclut que ces montants ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage \u00e0 M. Plante, pour son propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ou au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une autre personne que M. Plante d\u00e9sirait avantager.\n(i) en 2004 :\n[278] En 2004, des fonds totalisant 84 702 $ (ou 60 660 $ US) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante : comme indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 200 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, la preuve documentaire ne permet pas d\u2019identifier le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des transferts totalisant 50 000 $ US en provenance du compte d\u2019Apnet. Toutefois, vu l\u2019historique des retraits au compte bancaire d\u2019Apnet, la Cour a conclu que ce transfert a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par ch\u00e8que \u00e9mis au nom de M. Plante.\n[279] \u00c9galement, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 201 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, la preuve documentaire ne permet pas d\u2019identifier le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert de 10 700 $ US en provenance du compte bancaire d\u2019A+Shadow. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la Cour conclut que ce transfert a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante.\n(ii) en 2005 :\n[280] En 2005, des fonds totalisant 237 430 $ (ou 190 973 $ US) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante : comme indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 202 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, SPE a, entre autres, transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 190 973 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing. Quelques jours plus tard, SPE Marketing a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques totalisant 165 000 $ US \u00e0 des personnes ayant pr\u00eat\u00e9 des fonds \u00e0 SPE, soit \u00e0 Gilles Tanguay, Yves Lapointe, Alain Baillargeon, Bruno Baillargeon et Robert Baillargeon. Des fonds ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Letarte. Le total de tous ces transferts est quasi \u00e9quivalent aux sommes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par SPE \u00e0 SPE Marketing. Ainsi, la Cour conclut que ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une personne que M. Plante d\u00e9sirait avantager ou encore, pour son propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice.\n(iii) en 2006 :\n[281] En 2006 : aucun montant ne sera vers\u00e9 par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes que M. Plante.\n(iv) en 2007 :\n[282] En 2007, des fonds totalisant 225 032 $ (ou 209 204 $ US) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 M. Plante : SPE a, entre autres, transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 209 204 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing, qui a par la suite transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 205 037 $ US, soit 110 537 $ US \u00e0 Structured Management, 1 500 $ US \u00e0 A+Shadow et 93 000 $ US \u00e0 For Impex.\n[283] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic, la somme de 105 000 $ US vers\u00e9e par SPE Marketing \u00e0 Structured Management repr\u00e9sente un pr\u00eat. La Cour ne retient pas cette explication de M. Mavrovic. Tout d\u2019abord, aucune preuve documentaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 la Cour. En outre, comme mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la Cour a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Mavrovic n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible. La Cour conclut donc que ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante.\n[284] Concernant les fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 For Impex, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les fonds seront retir\u00e9s du compte bancaire par retraits au guichet par M. Plante sur une p\u00e9riode de quelques mois, et donc, la Cour conclut que ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante.\n[285] Finalement, pour les fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 A+Shadow, vu la preuve retenue par la Cour, la Cour conclut \u00e9galement que ces fonds ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante.\n(v) en 2008 :\n[286] En 2008, des fonds totalisant 60 551 $ (ou 56 533 $ US) n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s directement \u00e0 M. Plante : SPE a, entre autres, transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des fonds totalisant 56 533 $ US aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes, soit 25 910 $ US \u00e0 SPE Marketing, 31 612 $ US \u00e0 Structured Management, 10 963 $ US \u00e0 IntroTech et 988 $ US \u00e0 For Impex.\n[287] Concernant les transferts \u00e0 Structured Management (9 154 $ et 25 030 $), la Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que ces fonds n\u2019avaient pas servi \u00e0 payer pour les services d\u2019installation du progiciel \u00e0 California Closets. Ainsi, la Cour conclut que ces transferts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante ou au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une autre personne que M. Plante d\u00e9sirait avantager.\n[288] Pour les autres transferts, la Cour conclut \u00e9galement que ces fonds ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Plante ou au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019une personne qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait avantager.\n[289] Pour tous ces motifs, la troisi\u00e8me condition est remplie.\n(d) le paiement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le revenu du contribuable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel une nouvelle cotisation est \u00e9tablie si ce dernier l\u2019avait re\u00e7u lui-m\u00eame\n[290] Si les montants totalisant 1 526 144 $ avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE \u00e0 M. Plante plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, M. Plante aurait d\u00fb inclure ces sommes dans le calcul de son revenu en vertu du paragraphe 15(1), \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par SPE \u00e0 un actionnaire, soit M. Plante.\n[291] La partie pertinente du paragraphe 15(1) se lit ainsi :\n15(1) La valeur de l\u2019avantage qu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e8re, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, \u00e0 son actionnaire, \u00e0 un associ\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de personnes qui compte parmi ses actionnaires ou \u00e0 son actionnaire pressenti est incluse dans le calcul du revenu de l\u2019actionnaire, de l\u2019associ\u00e9 ou de l\u2019actionnaire pressenti, selon le cas, pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui comprend ce moment \u2026\n15(1) If, at any time, a benefit is conferred by a corporation on a shareholder of the corporation, on a member of a partnership that is a shareholder of the corporation or on a contemplated shareholder of the corporation, then the amount or value of the benefit is to be included in computing the income of the shareholder, member or contemplated shareholder, as the case may be, for its taxation year that includes the time \u2026\n[292] Aucune des exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 15(1) n\u2019est applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[293] Ainsi, la quatri\u00e8me condition est remplie.\n(e) arguments additionnels des appelants\n[294] Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent toutefois que la Cour ne peut conclure que le paragraphe 56(2) est applicable dans les circonstances, sans avoir conclu en la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un trompe-l\u2019\u0153il. Selon la Cour, cette interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 56(2) ne trouve aucune justification au regard des dispositions de la Loi.\n[295] En effet, rien dans le paragraphe 56(2) n\u2019exige la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une op\u00e9ration de trompe-l\u2019\u0153il. Par exemple, le paragraphe 56(2) peut s\u2019appliquer dans le cas d\u2019op\u00e9rations commerciales v\u00e9ritables, dans les cas o\u00f9 la valeur de la transaction a \u00e9t\u00e9 surestim\u00e9e par les parties (voir l\u2019affaire Winter, supra).\n[296] \u00c9galement, certaines d\u00e9cisions ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une cinqui\u00e8me condition devait \u00eatre remplie pour que le paragraphe 56(2) soit applicable, par exemple dans l\u2019affaire Winter, supra. Dans cette affaire, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 que la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie en vertu du paragraphe 56(2) dans le cas o\u00f9 le contribuable n\u2019avait aucun droit au paiement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 \u00ab ... est assujettie \u00e0 une condition implicite, soit celle que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ou le cessionnaire n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur l\u2019avantage qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u \u00bb (Winter, supra, par. 15). La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale justifie ainsi l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle condition de la fa\u00e7on suivante (au par. 14) :\nEn effet, selon moi, une disposition en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9vitement fiscal rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re essentiellement subsidiaire; sa raison d'\u00eatre est d'emp\u00eacher l'\u00e9vitement de l'imp\u00f4t payable sur une op\u00e9ration donn\u00e9e, et non de doubler l'imp\u00f4t normalement payable ni d'accorder aux autorit\u00e9s fiscales une discr\u00e9tion administrative qui leur permettrait de choisir entre deux contribuables possibles.\n[mes soulignements]\n[297] Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuman a refus\u00e9 de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle cinqui\u00e8me condition.\n[298] Plus r\u00e9cemment, la Cour s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur l\u2019application du paragraphe 56(2) dans Grenon c. La Reine, 2021 CCI 30 (par. 412-414) et a conclu que l\u2019arr\u00eat qui fait autorit\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re est l\u2019arr\u00eat Neuman, qui fait \u00e9tat de quatre conditions \u00e0 l\u2019application de ce paragraphe.\n[299] La Cour est du m\u00eame avis dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Toutefois, m\u00eame si cette cinqui\u00e8me condition devait \u00eatre remplie pour les fins d\u2019application du paragraphe 56(2), elle le serait dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances puisque les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019ont pas pay\u00e9 d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les fonds transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par SPE.\nD. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement des nouvelles cotisations hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation (sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i))\n[300] Le sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) se lit ainsi :\n152(4) Le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation, une nouvelle cotisation ou une cotisation suppl\u00e9mentaire concernant l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, qui sont payables par un contribuable en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie ou donner avis par \u00e9crit qu\u2019aucun imp\u00f4t n\u2019est payable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 toute personne qui a produit une d\u00e9claration de revenu pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition. Pareille cotisation ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation applicable au contribuable pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e que dans les cas suivants :\na) le contribuable ou la personne produisant la d\u00e9claration :\n(i) soit a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits, par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou a commis quelque fraude en produisant la d\u00e9claration ou en fournissant quelque renseignement sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\n[\u2026]\n152(4) The Minister may at any time make an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment of tax for a taxation year, interest or penalties, if any, payable under this Part by a taxpayer or notify in writing any person by whom a return of income for a taxation year has been filed that no tax is payable for the year, except that an assessment, reassessment or additional assessment may be made after the taxpayer\u2019s normal reassessment period in respect of the year only if\n(a) the taxpayer or person filing the return\n(i) has made any misrepresentation that is attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or has committed any fraud in filing the return or in supplying any information under this Act,\n[\u2026]\n[301] Puisque les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par le ministre apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire la preuve que les appelants ont fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par n\u00e9gligence, inattention ou omission volontaire, ou ont commis quelque fraude, en produisant leurs d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9es par ces appels (Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, [1961] Ex. C.R. 318, \u00e0 la page 320, 1961 CarswellNat 299, par. 4).\n[302] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019acquitte de ce fardeau s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019un revenu n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par le contribuable et qu\u2019aucune explication cr\u00e9dible n\u2019est fournie par celui-ci (Lacroix c. La Reine, 2008 CAF 241, par. 32). De m\u00eame, le fardeau du ministre est rempli si la Cour conclut que de fausses d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9es en d\u00e9duction par un contribuable.\n[303] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Plante a fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par omission volontaire en produisant les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de SPE et ses propres d\u00e9clarations de revenus, avec le concours de M. Mavrovic, en mettant en place l\u2019ensemble du stratag\u00e8me impliquant les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. SPE a ainsi fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 sur les d\u00e9penses encourues, afin de permettre \u00e0 M. Plante de s\u2019approprier les fonds, et ce dernier a omis de d\u00e9clarer les montants vers\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantage imposable.\n[304] Pour les motifs suivants, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la Cour conclut que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau. Les nouvelles cotisations \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de SPE et de M. Plante ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 152(4).\n[305] Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019examen de la preuve indique que SPE a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction de d\u00e9penses qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es ou encourues dans le but de tirer un revenu d\u2019entreprise et a donc fait une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e des faits par omission volontaire.\n[306] Quant \u00e0 M. Plante, la Cour arrive \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion : tout d\u2019abord, en 2003, M. Plante a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction d\u2019une d\u00e9pense \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du d\u00e9veloppement du Ramjet, d\u00e9pense qu\u2019il a admis n\u2019avoir jamais pay\u00e9e; \u00e9galement, pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 \u00e0 2008, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Plante a omis de d\u00e9clarer les montants vers\u00e9s par SPE aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, \u00e0 titre d\u2019avantages re\u00e7us de SPE, que ce soit concernant les pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00eats ou encore les sommes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9es \u00e0 certains cr\u00e9anciers de SPE par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ou les sommes vers\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes.\n[307] \u00c9galement, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Plante r\u00e9visait les d\u00e9clarations de revenus pr\u00e9par\u00e9es et produites par son comptable, soit autant ses propres d\u00e9clarations que celles de SPE.\n[308] Pour conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a rempli son fardeau, la Cour a \u00e9galement pris en compte les importants montants en litige et le fait que M. Plante est un homme d\u2019affaires ayant de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Ainsi, il est donc invraisemblable qu\u2019il ne savait pas ce qui se passait dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines.\n[309] Les appelants ont plaid\u00e9 que l\u2019article 32 de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat fait en sorte qu\u2019au Qu\u00e9bec, le d\u00e9lai pour \u00e9tablir une cotisation est de trois ans \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 le droit d\u2019action prend naissance. Selon les appelants, puisque le ministre connaissait les faits pertinents pour \u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations depuis le mois d\u2019avril 2009 ou m\u00eame avant, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible pour le ministre d\u2019\u00e9tablir de nouvelles cotisations apr\u00e8s le mois d\u2019avril 2012, soit plus de trois ans apr\u00e8s le mois d\u2019avril 2009. Les appelants r\u00e9f\u00e8rent au d\u00e9lai de prescription de trois ans pr\u00e9vu aux articles 2880 et 2925 C.c.Q.\n[310] L\u2019article 32 de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat se lit ainsi :\n32. Sauf disposition contraire de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou de toute autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les r\u00e8gles de droit en mati\u00e8re de prescription qui, dans une province, r\u00e9gissent les rapports entre particuliers s\u2019appliquent lors des poursuites auxquelles l\u2019\u00c9tat est partie pour tout fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur survenu dans la province. Lorsque ce dernier survient ailleurs que dans une province, la proc\u00e9dure se prescrit par six ans.\n[311] Les articles du C.c.Q. auxquels ont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 les appelants se lisent ainsi :\n2880. La d\u00e9possession fixe le point de d\u00e9part du d\u00e9lai de la prescription acquisitive.\nLe jour o\u00f9 le droit d\u2019action a pris naissance fixe le point de d\u00e9part de la prescription extinctive.\n2925. L\u2019action qui tend \u00e0 faire valoir un droit personnel ou un droit r\u00e9el mobilier et dont le d\u00e9lai de prescription n\u2019est pas autrement fix\u00e9 se prescrit par trois ans.\n[312] Pour les motifs suivants, la Cour ne peut retenir cet argument.\n[313] Tout d\u2019abord, en \u00e9tablissant une cotisation, le ministre n\u2019exerce pas un droit d\u2019action et ne fait pas valoir un droit au sens des articles 2880 et 2925 C.c.Q. En effet, notre syst\u00e8me fiscal \u00e9tant un syst\u00e8me d\u2019autocotisation, la jurisprudence a indiqu\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on constante, qu\u2019une dette fiscale naissait non pas par l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cotisation, mais par le fait de gagner ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus imposables (R. c. Simard-Beaudry Inc., [1971] C.F. 396, par. 20; Manna c. La Reine, 2019 CCI 70, par. 28).\n[314] \u00c9galement, comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans Peach c. Le Roi, 2022 CAF 163, le fait que le ministre disposait des informations n\u00e9cessaires pour cotiser au cours de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation n\u2019est pas pertinent et si les conditions pr\u00e9vues au sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) sont remplies, le ministre pourra cotiser hors de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation :\n[13] N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019appelant soutient que le ministre n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019\u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation parce qu\u2019il disposait de la documentation n\u00e9cessaire et de suffisamment de temps pour terminer sa v\u00e9rification avant la fin de cette p\u00e9riode. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un argument d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de fondement. Le libell\u00e9 du sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) indique clairement que le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une nouvelle cotisation pour un contribuable apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode normale de nouvelle cotisation dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La question de savoir si le ministre avait des motifs l\u00e9gitimes de ne pas \u00e9tablir de nouvelle cotisation dans le d\u00e9lai de trois ans n\u2019est pas pertinente en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une conclusion de pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e par n\u00e9gligence ou inattention en application du sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i) de la Loi.\n[mes soulignements]\n[315] De plus, comme la Cour l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Chan c. La Reine, 2010 CCI 3 (par. 15 et 16), le paragraphe 152(4) ne contient pas de d\u00e9lai de prescription et si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu pr\u00e9voir un tel d\u00e9lai, il l\u2019aurait indiqu\u00e9 express\u00e9ment.\n[316] Finalement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Markevich c. Canada, 2003 CSC 9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur les d\u00e9lais de prescription applicables aux mesures de recouvrement des dettes fiscales pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019article 32 de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Elle fera des comparaisons avec les dispositions de la Loi pr\u00e9voyant les d\u00e9lais pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cotisation. Notamment, selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, \u00ab de nombreuses dispositions pr\u00e9voient express\u00e9ment que le ministre peut \u00e9tablir une cotisation en tout temps, voir les par. 152(4) [\u2026] \u00bb (par. 16).\nE. Les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 163(2)\n[317] Le paragraphe 163(2) impose une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 toute personne qui, sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans une d\u00e9claration, un formulaire, un certificat, un \u00e9tat ou une r\u00e9ponse, ou y participe, y consent ou y acquiesce. Le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir les faits qui justifient l\u2019imposition de la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 repose sur le ministre et non sur les appelants (par. 163(3)).\n[318] La partie pertinente du paragraphe 163(2) se lit ainsi :\n163(2) Toute personne qui, sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans une d\u00e9claration, un formulaire, un certificat, un \u00e9tat ou une r\u00e9ponse (appel\u00e9 \u00ab d\u00e9claration \u00bb au pr\u00e9sent article) rempli, produit ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, selon le cas, pour une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou y participe, y consent ou y acquiesce est passible d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e9gale, sans \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 $, \u00e0 50 % du total des montants suivants \u2026.\n163(2) Every person who, knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, has made or has participated in, assented to or acquiesced in the making of, a false statement or omission in a return, form, certificate, statement or answer (in this section referred to as a \u201creturn\u201d) filed or made in respect of a taxation year for the purposes of this Act, is liable to a penalty of the greater of $100 and 50% of the total of \u2026\n[319] Selon le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 163(2), deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unis pour que soit applicable la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par ce paragraphe : (i) un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mental : \u00ab sciemment ou dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde \u00bb; (ii) un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mat\u00e9riel : \u00ab fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission \u00bb.\n[320] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que les appelants ont produit leurs d\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition, objet des appels; ainsi, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment mat\u00e9riel est pr\u00e9sent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (D\u2019Andrea c. La Reine, 2011 CCI 298, par. 36). Mais qu\u2019en est-il de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment mental? Est-ce que les appelants ont sciemment fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission ou ont-ils fait un faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ou une omission dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde?\n[321] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour les raisons invoqu\u00e9es ci-dessus concernant le sous-alin\u00e9a 152(4)a)(i), M. Plante, autant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour SPE, aurait, sciemment ou bien dans des circonstances \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 faute lourde, fait de faux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9clarations de revenus. Le ministre \u00e9tait donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019imposer des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s selon le paragraphe 163(2).\n[322] La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines n\u2019exer\u00e7aient aucune activit\u00e9 de mise en march\u00e9 du progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis, voire aucune activit\u00e9. M. Plante, avec le concours de M. Mavrovic, a mis en place les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines. Comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, il n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible de croire que M. Plante, un homme d\u2019affaires s\u00e9rieux et avis\u00e9, ne soit pas au courant des activit\u00e9s des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, surtout compte tenu des sommes importantes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es par SPE \u00e0 celles-ci au cours des ann\u00e9es. Tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Plante dira que ce sont les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de M. Mavrovic et que c\u2019est M. Mavrovic qui s\u2019occupe de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Bien que la Cour con\u00e7oive que ce soit M. Mavrovic qui s\u2019occupe des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines, la Cour ne peut croire que M. Plante ne connaissait pas les activit\u00e9s de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. SPE a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des sommes consid\u00e9rables aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines pour soi-disant faire du d\u00e9marchage pour le progiciel aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Toutefois, SPE ou M. Plante n\u2019ont re\u00e7u aucun rapport des activit\u00e9s entreprises par celles-ci ou leurs employ\u00e9s, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ce qui est invraisemblable. De plus, comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, il n\u2019est pas vraisemblable de croire que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines ont fait des pr\u00eats \u00e0 M. Plante, comme les appelants tentent de le faire croire.\n[323] Pour tous ces motifs, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la Cour conclut que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que M.

Contexte\n[1] L\u2019appelant interjette appel d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de trois avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination visant le cr\u00e9dit pour la taxe sur les produits et services\/taxe de vente harmonis\u00e9e (CTPS) et d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de trois avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination visant l\u2019allocation canadienne pour enfants (ACE). Chacune de ces s\u00e9ries a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en vertu de la Loi [1] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ann\u00e9es de base 2015, 2016 et 2017 de l\u2019appelant. La ministre du Revenu national (Ministre) a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la baisse le CTPS de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la hauteur du cr\u00e9dit de base de 276$ et 280$ pour ses ann\u00e9es de base 2015 et 2016 respectivement consid\u00e9rant l'inadmissibilit\u00e9 des enfants \u00e0 charge, et finalement a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas lui-m\u00eame admissible au CTPS pour son ann\u00e9e de base 2017 en raison d\u2019un statut de non-r\u00e9sident du Canada. Aussi, la Ministre a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 l\u2019ACE pour ses ann\u00e9es de base 2015, 2016 et 2017 en raison de l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 des enfants \u00e0 charge.\n[2] La Cour juge approprier de rappeler les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes pour les versements et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au CTPS et \u00e0 l\u2019ACE. Le CTPS est un cr\u00e9dit annuel calcul\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e de base et remis en quatre versements \u00e9gaux tous les trois mois. Par exemple, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e de base 2015, la p\u00e9riode de versement est de juillet 2016 \u00e0 juin 2017 et les versements sont juillet 2016, octobre 2016, janvier 2017 et avril 2017. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019ACE, le cr\u00e9dit est calcul\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e de base et remis mensuellement. Similairement au CTPS, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e de base 2015, la p\u00e9riode de versement de l\u2019ACE est de juillet 2016 \u00e0 juin 2017. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au CTPS est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au d\u00e9but du mois o\u00f9 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) fait le versement, soit le 1er juillet, le 1er octobre, le 1er janvier et le 1er avril. Cependant, l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACE est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de chaque mois de l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il y a un versement. Autrement dit, la p\u00e9riode de versement est la m\u00eame pour le CTPS et l\u2019ACE, soit de juillet d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 juin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, mais la date des versements et le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e diff\u00e8re.\n[3] Les avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination de la Ministre en appel pour le CTPS pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de base 2015, 2016 et 2017 de l\u2019appelant couvrent d\u2019octobre 2016 \u00e0 avril 2017, de juillet 2017 \u00e0 avril 2018 et de juillet 2018 \u00e0 avril 2019, respectivement. Aux m\u00eames fins, l\u2019avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination de la Ministre en appel pour l\u2019ACE pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de base 2015, 2016 et 2017 de l\u2019appelant couvre du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 au mois de juin 2017, de juillet 2017 \u00e0 juin 2018 et du mois de juillet 2018 au mois de f\u00e9vrier 2019, respectivement. En cons\u00e9quence, la p\u00e9riode totale du 1er ao\u00fbt 2016 au 30 avril 2019 est la p\u00e9riode totale en litige (P\u00e9riode en litige).\nII. Situation factuelle\n[4] L\u2019appelant est originaire du Cameroun (r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Ouest). En juin 2008, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 34 ans, il \u00e9migre seul au Canada. Il devient citoyen canadien en mars 2014. \u00c0 cette p\u00e9riode, la preuve ne supporte pas que l\u2019appelant a une conjointe. En f\u00e9vrier 2015, l\u2019appelant est victime d\u2019un accident grave de la route. Des blessures physiques et un stress post-traumatique s\u2019ensuivent. Cet accident laisse l\u2019appelant face \u00e0 une longue p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9habilitation durant laquelle il est indemnis\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[5] Le ou vers le 13 juin 2016, l\u2019appelant se rend au Cameroun. Un certain nombre d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements s\u2019y produit notamment :\na. Le 30 juin 2016, l\u2019appelant et Madame Tanga Natalie n\u00e9e Ilemes, signent un bail de location d\u2019une maison de 4 chambres, salon, douche, cuisine, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du quartier Nkoabang, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroun. La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au soutien de l\u2019existence de ce bail ne pr\u00e9cise pas la dur\u00e9e du bail mais confirme un loyer mensuel qui s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve alors \u00e0 135 000 FCFA.\nb. Le 5 juillet 2016, l\u2019appelant \u00e9pouse Madame Tanga Natalie n\u00e9e Ilemes. La conjointe de l\u2019appelant est alors la m\u00e8re biologique de trois enfants mineurs n\u00e9s en 2000, 2004 et 2012 dont elle assure la garde. L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas le p\u00e8re biologique des enfants mineurs de sa conjointe.\nc. Dans les jours qui suivent la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage, l\u2019appelant rencontre la travailleuse sociale d\u00e9sign\u00e9e et charg\u00e9e d\u2019assurer le bien-\u00eatre des trois enfants mineurs d\u2019un fr\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant. Au cours d\u2019une rencontre subs\u00e9quente avec la travailleuse sociale et un notaire, il est question que l\u2019appelant obtienne la tutelle des trois enfants mineurs de son fr\u00e8re alors n\u00e9s en 2000, 2007 et 2008. Les enfants habiteront dor\u00e9navant avec la famille dans la maison lou\u00e9e.\nd. \u00c0 son retour au Canada, le ou vers le 7 juillet 2016, l\u2019appelant formalise la tutelle des trois enfants de son fr\u00e8re. Le 8 juillet 2016, la tutelle est officialis\u00e9e au Cameroun et l\u2019appelant assume dor\u00e9navant les responsabilit\u00e9s de soins et d\u2019\u00e9ducation des trois enfants mineurs de son fr\u00e8re.\n[6] En aucun moment au cours de la P\u00e9riode en litige, la conjointe de l\u2019appelant, les enfants de cette derni\u00e8re, et les enfants de son fr\u00e8re ne r\u00e9siderons au Canada, ne s\u00e9journerons au Canada ou ne visiterons l\u2019appelant au Canada.\n[7] L\u2019appelant et sa conjointe seront \u00e9ventuellement les parents biologiques d\u2019autres enfants mais subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 la P\u00e9riode en litige.\n[8] Depuis son retour le 7 juillet 2016, l\u2019appelant poursuit seul sa r\u00e9sidence au Canada dans un logement qui l\u2019occupe depuis quelques ann\u00e9es Avenue Hector \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. En f\u00e9vrier 2017, la sant\u00e9 de sa m\u00e8re au Cameroun se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore. Il se rend au Cameroun. Le billet d\u2019avion d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve indique un d\u00e9part le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2017 et un retour le 1er avril 2017. Il explique qu\u2019il a alors tent\u00e9 de rapprocher sa m\u00e8re de sa conjointe et de sa famille en acqu\u00e9rant une parcelle de terrain de 500m2 vacant pr\u00e8s de la maison lou\u00e9e pour y construire une r\u00e9sidence pouvant accueillir sa m\u00e8re, mais le projet n\u2019est pas concr\u00e9tis\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re en 2017. Il conserve le lot acquis. Au Canada, au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en 2017, l\u2019employeur de l\u2019appelant officialise la fin de son emploi que l\u2019accident de voiture a priv\u00e9 de maintenir.\n[9] En 2016 et 2017, la sant\u00e9 mentale de l\u2019appelant se d\u00e9grade. Son m\u00e9decin traitant l\u2019incite \u00e0 consulter un psychiatre. La situation de sa m\u00e8re le pr\u00e9occupe. D\u00e9but 2018, le psychiatre de l\u2019appelant lui recommande un retour prolong\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de sa famille au Cameroun. Toutefois, c\u2019est le m\u00e9decin traitant qui confirme par billet m\u00e9dical un d\u00e9part de l\u2019appelant pour le Cameroun d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019au moins 24 mois. Le billet m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2018 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve est succinct et ne mentionne qu\u2019un d\u00e9part pour une dur\u00e9e d\u2019au moins 24 mois. Le billet ne pr\u00e9cise pas le diagnostic, le traitement ou le pronostic concernant l\u2019appelant.\n[10] En pr\u00e9vision de son d\u00e9part au Cameroun en avril 2018, l\u2019appelant confirme \u00e0 son locateur Avenue Hector son intention de renouveler le bail d\u2019une autre ann\u00e9e de juillet 2018 \u00e0 juin 2019. Un bail sign\u00e9 des deux parties le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2018 couvrant cette p\u00e9riode est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. La preuve confirme qu\u2019au m\u00eame moment il est convenu entre le propri\u00e9taire et le locataire que l\u2019appelant d\u00e9sire sous-lou\u00e9 le logement consid\u00e9rant son d\u00e9part imminent pour le Cameroun. Ultimement, le locateur sera en mesure de trouver un sous-locataire \u00e0 compter du 1er juin 2018. Le dernier mois de loyer assum\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant pour le logement de l\u2019Avenue Hector est mai 2018. Avant son d\u00e9part pour le Cameroun, l\u2019appelant retire ses meubles du logement qui l\u2019entrepose au sous-sol de connaissances. Apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part pour le Cameroun en avril 2018, l\u2019appelant ne retournera plus au logement de l\u2019Avenue Hector.\n[11] Le ou vers le 19 avril 2018, l\u2019appelant quitte le Canada pour rejoindre sa famille au Cameroun. Contrairement \u00e0 son billet d\u2019avion d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve concernant son voyage en f\u00e9vrier 2017, le billet d\u2019avion du 19 avril 2018 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve \u00e0 destination du Cameroun ne contient pas de billet de retour. La preuve indique qu\u2019au moment de son d\u00e9part l\u2019appelant conserve son compte bancaire et sa marge de cr\u00e9dit au Canada dont les soldes ne sont pas mat\u00e9riels, des meubles entrepos\u00e9s, un lien financier avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec suite \u00e0 l\u2019accident de voiture survenu en f\u00e9vrier 2015. Aucun autre actif financier notable ne se trouve au Canada. Il conserve aussi chez un ami deux valises dans lesquelles des v\u00eatements se trouvent. L\u2019ami permet aussi \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019indiquer son domicile comme adresse de correspondance. Aucun contrat de location ou d\u2019habitation formel n\u2019intervient entre l\u2019appelant et l\u2019ami. L\u2019appelant n\u2019occupe aucun emploi au Canada \u00e0 son d\u00e9part.\n[12] Alors au Cameroun depuis avril 2018, l\u2019appelant d\u00e9pose une premi\u00e8re demande d\u2019ACE le ou vers le 17 ao\u00fbt 2018 visant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au programme des six enfants en charge.\n[13] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 5 octobre 2018 au 3 mai 2019, la Ministre proc\u00e8dera \u00e0 des d\u00e9terminations et des nouvelles d\u00e9terminations concernant le CTPS et l\u2019ACE de l\u2019appelant. Au final, le 5 mars 2019, la Ministre d\u00e9termine que seul l\u2019appelant est admissible \u00e0 un CTPS au montant de 276$ et 280$ pour les mois d\u2019octobre 2016 \u00e0 avril 2017 (ann\u00e9e de base 2015) et de juillet 2017 \u00e0 avril 2018 (ann\u00e9e de base 2016) respectivement, en raison de l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 des enfants. Et le 3 mai 2019, la Ministre d\u00e9termine que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas admissible au CTPS pour les mois de juillet 2018 \u00e0 avril 2019 (ann\u00e9e de base 2017) en raison du manquement \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de r\u00e9sidence au Canada au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[14] Le 20 mars 2019, la Ministre d\u00e9termine que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 l\u2019ACE pour les mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 \u00e0 juin 2017 (ann\u00e9e de base 2015), de juillet 2017 \u00e0 juin 2018 (ann\u00e9e de base 2016) et de juillet 2018 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2019 (ann\u00e9e de base 2017), en raison de la situation des enfants.\n[15] L\u2019appelant reviens au Canada suite \u00e0 son s\u00e9jour au Cameroun le ou vers le 17 avril 2019 anim\u00e9 d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de contester les positions de la Ministre.\nIII. Questions en litige\n[16] Les questions en litige sont de d\u00e9terminer (i) si l\u2019appelant est au cours de la p\u00e9riode du 1er ao\u00fbt 2016 au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2019 un particulier admissible aux fins du programme de l\u2019ACE pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 122.6 de la Loi, et (ii) si l\u2019appelant pour les mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de juillet et octobre 2018 et janvier et avril 2019 (donc la p\u00e9riode du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019) et les enfants \u00e0 charge mineurs de l\u2019appelant pour les mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s compris dans la P\u00e9riode en litige et pour lesquels un CTPS est r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un particulier admissible et des personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles, respectivement, aux fins du programme de CTPS pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 122.5 de la Loi.\n[17] Relativement \u00e0 ces questions, seules les conditions sp\u00e9cifiques identifi\u00e9es \u00e0 la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s peuvent faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant et des enfants mineurs aux fins des programmes de l\u2019ACE et de CTPS.\nIV. Position des parties\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient essentiellement que, par rapport aux mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de juillet et octobre 2018 et janvier et avril 2019 (la p\u00e9riode du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019), l\u2019appelant, et par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de la P\u00e9riode en litige, les enfants \u00e0 charge, aucun ne satisfait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible et de personne \u00e0 charge admissible, respectivement, aux fins du CTPS en raison de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.5(2)c) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019aucun d\u2019entre eux ne r\u00e9side au Canada pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9 cite la d\u00e9cision Goldstein [2] de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui d\u00e9termine que la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un contribuable est l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 \u00ab dans sa vie de tous les jours, y habite d\u2019une mani\u00e8re r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, normale ou habituelle \u00bb par opposition \u00e0 \u00ab quelqu\u2019un qui y demeurerait exceptionnellement, occasionnellement ou par intermittence \u00bb. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas suffisamment de liens avec le Canada pour la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant \u00e0 son d\u00e9part pour le Cameroun en 2018 pour conserver la r\u00e9sidence fiscale canadienne.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient sommairement que l\u2019appelant pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er ao\u00fbt 2016 au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2019 ne satisfait pas la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible aux fins de l\u2019ACE en raison des alin\u00e9as 122.6(1)a) et c), et du sous-alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)b)(i) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible telle qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e aux alin\u00e9as f) et h) de la m\u00eame d\u00e9finition.\n[21] L\u2019appelant soutient que toutes ces conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites. Que les programmes dont il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 l\u2019application incluent la situation qui le concerne. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u citoyen canadien, le Canada est sa maison, il a toujours fait les choses comme il se doit dans ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus et son devoir est de subvenir aux besoins de sa famille. Puisqu\u2019il contribue financi\u00e8rement pour l\u2019\u00e9ducation et le soin de ses enfants; il soumet avoir droit \u00e0 l\u2019ACE et le CTPS pour ses enfants \u00e0 charge. Seules des circonstances particuli\u00e8res l\u2019ont forc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9loigner du Canada pour une p\u00e9riode \u00e0 la fois et qu\u2019il est revenu au Canada \u00e0 chacune de ces occasions. Il a m\u00eame \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019ARC avant son d\u00e9placement au Cameroun pour se renseigner. L\u2019ARC n\u2019est pas en droit de s\u2019acharner sur sa situation. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 aux programmes par l\u2019ARC initialement et rien ne justifie de s\u2019\u00e9carter de cette d\u00e9cision, et encore moins d\u2019exercer des mesures de recouvrement alors que son dossier est devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t. L\u2019appelant plaide que le renversement de la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait discriminatoire et que l\u2019ARC a bafou\u00e9 ces droits.\n[22] \u00c0 titre de rappel, le fardeau de la preuve, en mati\u00e8re fiscale, appartient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. L\u2019appelant a le fardeau de d\u00e9molir les pr\u00e9somptions de fait que la Ministre a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation, et prouver, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, les faits qui supportent sa position que la d\u00e9termination est mal fond\u00e9e [3]. C\u2019est ce m\u00eame fardeau que l\u2019appelant doit assumer dans le pr\u00e9sent appel et d\u00e9montrer, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les nouvelles d\u00e9terminations sont mal fond\u00e9es relativement aux conditions soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nV. T\u00e9moignages\n[23] Deux t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. L\u2019appelant a fait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 monsieur Eric Deumeni et lui-m\u00eame. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a contre-interrog\u00e9 les deux t\u00e9moins mais n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin en interrogatoire principal.\n[24] M. Deumeni a fait la connaissance de l\u2019appelant en 2013, peu de temps apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e au Canada. Il a rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019appelant alors qu\u2019ils occupaient chacun un emploi chez American Iron & Metal (AIM).\n[25] M. Deumeni a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019avant le d\u00e9part de l\u2019appelant au Cameroun au cours du mois d\u2019avril 2018, l\u2019appelant a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 son adresse chez lui et a laiss\u00e9 sur place des valises contenant des objets personnels. Par contre, il ne confirme pas clairement qu\u2019une entente formelle de location \u00e9tait alors intervenue entre eux :\nM. TANGA: Avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9\u2026 avez-vous\u2026en 2018, avant l\u2019appel\u2026 avant le d\u00e9part de M. Tanga pour le Cameroun, avez-vous eu une entente de cohabitation?\nM. DEUMENI: En fait, on n\u2019a pas eu une entente de cohabitation, mais puisque vous ne devez pas \u00eatre au Cameroun, vous avez, je crois, vous avez transf\u00e9r\u00e9 votre adresse chez moi, puisque c\u2019est moi qui recevait vos documents officiels, tous les documents officiels que je vous les scannais de fa\u00e7on num\u00e9rique. Et puis la plupart des documents que moi j\u2019ai\u2026 je vous les ai remis de fa\u00e7on physique, puisque je me suis rendu au Cameroun en 2018. En aout 2018, c\u2019\u00e9tait pendant ma p\u00e9riode de mariage. Je me suis d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans la ville de Yaound\u00e9 pour remettre officiellement tous les documents que je vous avais scann\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on num\u00e9rique dans votre famille, puisque vous \u00e9tiez l\u00e0 avec madame et les enfants. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019ai fait.\n[26] Cependant le t\u00e9moin reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u des sommes de l\u2019appelant pendant son s\u00e9jour d\u2019avril 2018 \u00e0 avril 2019 au Cameroun :\nM. TANGA: Est-ce que pendant cette p\u00e9riode de 2018, p\u00e9riode du d\u00e9part de M. Tanga pour le Cameroun, p\u00e9riode \u00e0 laquelle vous receviez ces documents, ces courriers, et autres, est-ce que M. Tanga contribuait financi\u00e8rement?\nDEUMENI: Oui. Il arrivait que de petits (inaudible) soient faits pour me permettre aussi de payer les charges qui m\u2019\u00e9taient incomb\u00e9es.\n[27] Au cours de l\u2019absence de l\u2019appelant du Canada pendant un an, le t\u00e9moin aura re\u00e7u de l\u2019appelant 1 290$ soit deux paiements totalisant 275$ en juin 2018, deux paiements totalisant 615$ en juillet 2018 et finalement 400$ en janvier 2019 (Pi\u00e8ce A-1).\n[28] Lors du retour au Canada de l\u2019appelant en avril 2019, M. Deumeni et l\u2019appelant ont v\u00e9cu ensemble bri\u00e8vement le temps que ce dernier se retrouve un nouveau logement. M. Deumeni a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une lettre pour confirmer qu\u2019il y avait eu entente de colocation (Pi\u00e8ce A-2). Le t\u00e9moin a confirm\u00e9 que cette lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par lui \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019appelant. La courte lettre d\u2019une page n\u2019est pas dat\u00e9e, et le t\u00e9moin n\u2019a pas formellement confirm\u00e9 celle-ci. Cependant, la Cour remarque que les temps de verbe utilis\u00e9s sont pass\u00e9s. En contre-interrogatoire le t\u00e9moin affirmera :\nME CHARBONNEAU-SAULNIER: Et M. Tanga vous a expliqu\u00e9 que cette preuve-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait requise dans le cadre de sa demande d\u2019allocation canadienne pour enfant avec l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada?\nM. DEUMENI: Non. Il m\u2019avait juste demand\u00e9 si je pouvais lui r\u00e9diger une lettre confirmant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 colocataire pendant cette p\u00e9riode. C\u2019est tout. Pour les autres, je ne\u2026 c\u2019est \u00e7a.\n[29] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Deumeni ne confirme aucune somme d\u2019argent (\u00e0 titre de loyer ou autrement, en vertu d\u2019une entente ou non) qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise par l\u2019appelant depuis son retour au Canada en avril 2019 jusqu\u2019au cours du mois de juin 2019 au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant s\u2019installe dans un nouveau logement.\n[30] Lors de la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant en avril 2018 alors que l\u2019appelant se trouvait au Cameroun, M. Deumeni recevait la poste de l\u2019appelant, et selon la nature des documents re\u00e7us, soit il les num\u00e9risait pour les envoyer \u00e9lectroniquement, soit il lui avait remis en main propre lors de son s\u00e9jour au Cameroun en 2018.\n[31] Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant confirme la situation factuelle d\u00e9crite plus haut. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments s\u2019y ajoutent :\na. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e au Qu\u00e9bec en 2008, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour un temps recruteur de joueurs pour des ligues de soccer. Il a \u00e9galement cr\u00e9\u00e9, en 2010, l\u2019Association Humanitaires Jeunesse et Avenir (l\u2019Association) qui \u0153uvrait au Qu\u00e9bec avec le but de combattre la pauvret\u00e9 au Cameroun. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait l\u2019administrateur principal de l\u2019Association. \u00c0 l\u2019aide de l\u2019Association, les donateurs envoyaient des livres au Cameroun pour fournir des biblioth\u00e8ques municipales.\nb. Il a soutenu ne plus \u00eatre un citoyen camerounais, il a un passeport canadien et est d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019une carte d\u2019assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec.\nc. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 avoir subi un accident de la route violent en f\u00e9vrier 2015 et les s\u00e9quelles qui en sont suivies. Il recevait des indemnit\u00e9s de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec suite \u00e0 cet accident.\nd. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re en 2017 et de la d\u00e9gradation subs\u00e9quente de sa sant\u00e9 mentale li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce d\u00e9c\u00e8s et \u00e0 son arr\u00eat de travail. Ne pouvant plus retourner \u00e0 son emploi consid\u00e9rant son incapacit\u00e9 physique, AIM a mis fin \u00e0 son contrat d\u2019emploi en f\u00e9vrier 2018. \u00c0 son retour au Canada en avril 2019, il a trouv\u00e9 un autre emploi dans une r\u00e9sidence pour personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es qu\u2019il occupe toujours.\ne. L\u2019appelant a ensuite t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son retour au Qu\u00e9bec en avril 2019, il avait une entente avec M. Deumeni qu\u2019il vivrait au 8575 avec ce dernier.\nf. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 longuement des \u00e9changes qu\u2019il a eus avec l\u2019ARC et le sentiment de se faire pers\u00e9cuter que celle-ci lui a fait vivre. L\u2019appelant a fait part d\u2019avoir fourni de nombreux documents et information \u00e0 l\u2019ARC.\ng. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 que ses six enfants \u00e0 charge ne sont pas venus au Canada pendant la p\u00e9riode en litige, car les \u00e9duquer au Cameroun \u00e9tait plus simple et abordable.\nh. Enfin, l\u2019appelant a ajout\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard aux soins qu\u2019il procure aux enfants \u00e0 sa charge. Il a souscrit une assurance de sant\u00e9 pour certains des enfants et il envoie des fonds pour leur entretien et \u00e9ducation. Il a renseign\u00e9 la Cour \u00e0 propos des sacrifices financiers qu\u2019il a faits pour les enfants \u00e9tant \u00e0 lui seul responsable financi\u00e8rement de la famille, sa femme \u00e9tant sans emploi. Toutes les factures au Cameroun \u00e9taient \u00e0 son nom. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail du bien-\u00eatre des enfants et de la relation qu\u2019il a avec eux.\nVI. Analyse\nA. Dispositions pertinentes de la Loi\n[32] Aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant au CTPS, la disposition l\u00e9gislative centrale dans le pr\u00e9sent litige se trouve au paragraphe 122.5(2) de la Loi. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019unique disposition qu\u2019invoque l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour soutenir que, au cours des p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 18, l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas un particulier admissible et ses enfants \u00e0 charges mineurs ne sont pas des personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles telles que ces expressions sont d\u00e9finies aux fins du CTPS. Les passages pertinents des paragraphes 122.5(2) et accessoirement (4) de la Loi se lisent comme suit :\n(2) Malgr\u00e9 le paragraphe (1), n\u2019est ni un particulier admissible, ni un proche admissible, ni une personne \u00e0 charge admissible, par rapport \u00e0 un mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9 d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, la personne qui, selon le cas :\n(\u2026)\nc) est une personne non-r\u00e9sidente au d\u00e9but de ce mois, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une personne non-r\u00e9sidente qui, \u00e0 la fois :\n(i) est, \u00e0 ce moment, l\u2019\u00e9poux ou le conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 d\u2019une personne qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9e, par le paragraphe 250(1), r\u00e9sider au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui comprend le premier jour de ce mois,\n(ii) a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada \u00e0 un moment ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce mois;\n(\u2026)\n(4) Pour l\u2019application du pr\u00e9sent article, les mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition sont juillet et octobre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition suivante et janvier et avril de la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition suivante.\n(notre soulignement)\n[33] Aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019ACE, la disposition l\u00e9gislative pertinente au litige se trouve au paragraphe 122.6(1) de la Loi. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019unique disposition qu\u2019invoque l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour soutenir que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas un particulier admissible tel que d\u00e9fini aux fins de l\u2019ACE au cours de la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 20. Les extraits pertinents de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible au paragraphe 122.6(1) se lisent comme suit :\n(1) particulier admissible S\u2019agissant, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, du particulier admissible \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge admissible, personne qui r\u00e9pond aux conditions suivantes \u00e0 ce moment :\na) elle r\u00e9side avec la personne \u00e0 charge;\nb) elle est la personne \u2014 p\u00e8re ou m\u00e8re de la personne \u00e0 charge \u2014 qui :\n(i) assume principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de la personne \u00e0 charge et qui n\u2019est pas un parent ayant la garde partag\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celle-ci,\n(\u2026)\nc) elle r\u00e9side au Canada ou, si elle est l\u2019\u00e9poux ou conjoint de fait vis\u00e9 d\u2019une personne qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9e, par le paragraphe 250(1), r\u00e9sider au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui comprend ce moment, y a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition ant\u00e9rieure;\n(\u2026)\nPour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9finition :\nf) si la personne \u00e0 charge r\u00e9side avec sa m\u00e8re, la personne qui assume principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de la personne \u00e0 charge est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00eatre la m\u00e8re;\n(\u2026)\nh) les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par r\u00e8glement serviront \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer en quoi consistent le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019une personne;\n(\u2026)\n(notre soulignement)\n[34] Le statut des enfants \u00e0 titre de personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles aux fins de l\u2019ACE n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9. Par contre, le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelant de satisfaire \u00e0 un seul des alin\u00e9as a), b) et c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible suffira \u00e0 faire \u00e9chec \u00e0 la qualification de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 titre de particulier admissible aux fins de l\u2019ACE. En effet, toutes les conditions de la d\u00e9finition doivent \u00eatre satisfaites pour \u00eatre reconnu un particulier admissible.\nB. Statut aux fins du CTPS\n[35] Aux fins du CTPS, les enfants de l\u2019appelant ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles consid\u00e9rant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.5(1)c) de la Loi. La Loi ne contient aucune disposition permettant de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019ils sont r\u00e9sidents du Canada aux fins de la Loi ou m\u00eame aux fins d\u2019une ou s\u00e9rie de dispositions nomm\u00e9es. Les crit\u00e8res retenus par les tribunaux pour \u00e9tablir un statut de r\u00e9sident au Canada aux fins de la Loi ne sont pas non plus utiles dans les circonstances. En effet, les enfants n\u2019ont jamais visit\u00e9s ou s\u00e9journ\u00e9s au Canada durant la P\u00e9riode en litige ou m\u00eame avant. Ce contexte \u00e0 lui seul met fin \u00e0 toute possibilit\u00e9 de qualifier \u00e0 quelque moment durant la P\u00e9riode en litige les enfants de personnes \u00e0 charge admissibles aux fins du CTPS de l\u2019appelant.\n[36] Le statut des enfants \u00e9tant d\u00e9termin\u00e9, l\u2019unique question en suspens aux fins du CTPS est de d\u00e9terminer, consid\u00e9rant la nouvelle d\u00e9termination effectu\u00e9e par la Ministre le 3 mai 2019 (Pi\u00e8ce I-31), si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un r\u00e9sident du Canada au cours des mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de son ann\u00e9e de base 2017. Le paragraphe 122.5(4) de la Loi fixe les mois d\u00e9termin\u00e9s pertinents au mois de juillet et octobre 2018, et janvier et avril 2019, et donc la p\u00e9riode examin\u00e9e pertinente aux fins de l\u2019ACE est du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019.\na) Crit\u00e8res de r\u00e9sidence au Canada\n[37] La d\u00e9cision Thomson [4] constitue un arr\u00eat-cl\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9termination du lieu de r\u00e9sidence d'une personne qui a quitt\u00e9 le Canada [5].\n[38] La d\u00e9cision Thomson nous enseigne que la question \u00e0 trancher consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'endroit o\u00f9 le contribuable vit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, normalement ou ordinairement dans le cadre de son mode de vie ordinaire. On doit examiner le degr\u00e9 auquel une personne s'installe mentalement et en fait, \u00e0 un endroit, y maintien ou y centralise son mode de vie habituel, y compris les relations sociales, les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les commodit\u00e9s. Le juge Rand formulent les conclusions suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nL'\u00e9tablissement de degr\u00e9s concernant le temps, l'objet, l'intention, la continuit\u00e9 et d'autres circonstances pertinentes montre, je pense, qu'en langage ordinaire le mot \"r\u00e9sider\" ne correspond pas \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments invariables devant tous \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents dans chaque cas. Il est tout \u00e0 fait impossible d'en donner une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise et exhaustive. C'est un mot tr\u00e8s souple dont les nombreuses nuances de sens varient non seulement selon le contexte de diverses causes, mais aussi selon diff\u00e9rents aspects de la m\u00eame cause. Dans un cas, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments seront suffisants et, dans un autre cas, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suppl\u00e9mentaires devront \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents.\nL'expression \"r\u00e9sident habituel\" v\u00e9hicule un sens restreint et, bien que la premi\u00e8re impression soit que le facteur temps est pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant, les d\u00e9cisions portant sur la loi anglaise rejettent ce point de vue. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 que le fait d'\u00eatre \"r\u00e9sident habituel\" d'un lieu s'inscrit dans le mode de vie habituel de la personne concern\u00e9e et est diff\u00e9rent du fait de r\u00e9sider exceptionnellement ou occasionnellement \u00e0 un endroit. Le mode de vie g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est donc pertinent quant \u00e0 l'application de cette expression.\nAux fins des lois en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, il faut pr\u00e9sumer que toute personne a une r\u00e9sidence en tout temps. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que ce soit une maison, un lieu d'habitation particulier ou m\u00eame un abri. Une personne peut coucher en plein air. Il importe seulement de d\u00e9terminer les limites spatiales dans lesquelles une personne passe sa vie ou auxquelles est li\u00e9 le mode de vie coutumier d'une personne. La meilleure fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence habituelle est de la comparer avec une r\u00e9sidence occasionnelle ou fortuite. Dans ce dernier cas, il semble nettement s'agir d'une r\u00e9sidence temporaire et exceptionnelle, ayant \u00e9galement une connotation transitoire avant le retour.\nToutefois, dans les diverses situations o\u00f9 il est question de r\u00e9sidence \"permanente\", \"temporaire\", \"habituelle\", \"principale\", etc., les adjectifs utilis\u00e9s ne changent rien au fait qu'il s'agit dans tous les cas d'une r\u00e9sidence; cette qualit\u00e9 tient principalement au degr\u00e9 auquel une personne s'installe mentalement et en fait \u00e0 un endroit ou y maintient ou y centralise son mode de vie habituel, y compris les relations sociales, les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les commodit\u00e9s. Une r\u00e9sidence peut \u00eatre limit\u00e9e dans le temps d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part ou peut \u00eatre ind\u00e9finie ou consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme illimit\u00e9e. Secondairement, les diverses sortes de r\u00e9sidences doivent \u00eatre distingu\u00e9es des lieux de \"s\u00e9jour\" ou de \"visite\", tout comme c'est le cas \u00e0 mon avis dans le langage ordinaire.\n[39] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans deux d\u00e9cisions [6] ent\u00e9rine la position voulant que le test l\u00e9gal pour \u00e9tablir la r\u00e9sidence est \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019est un r\u00e9sident dans un pays un contribuable qui, dans sa vie de tous les jours, y habite de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, normale ou habituelle, par opposition \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qui y demeurerait exceptionnellement, occasionnellement ou par intermittence.\n[40] Les liens que le contribuable entretient avec le Canada au moment de son d\u00e9part sont les indicateurs permettant de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il a conserv\u00e9 ou non sa r\u00e9sidence aux fins de la Loi. Dans l\u2019un de ses folios [7], qui est utile mais non contraignant, l\u2019ARC divise ces liens entre le primaire et le secondaire, le primaire \u00e9tant le plus important. Les liens principaux sont un logement, un conjoint ou une personne \u00e0 charge. Les liens secondaires sont plus vari\u00e9s et vont de liens \u00e9conomiques tels qu\u2019un emploi, des biens personnels, passeport canadien, protection d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 provincial, etc.\n[41] L\u2019ARC consid\u00e8re que si un particulier quitte le Canada, mais y conserve un logement (dont il est propri\u00e9taire ou qu'il loue) qui lui demeure disponible, ce logement est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un lien de r\u00e9sidence important avec le Canada pendant la dur\u00e9e de son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. L\u2019ARC ajoute :\nToutefois, si le particulier loue un logement situ\u00e9 au Canada \u00e0 un tiers \u00e0 des conditions de pleine concurrence, l'ARC soup\u00e8sera tous les faits en cause (notamment la relation qui existe entre le particulier et le tiers, le march\u00e9 immobilier au moment o\u00f9 le particulier quitte le Canada et le but du s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger). L'ARC pourrait alors consid\u00e9rer que le logement ne constitue pas un lien de r\u00e9sidence important avec le Canada, sauf lorsqu'on le prend en compte avec l'ensemble d'autres liens de r\u00e9sidence.\n[42] Au sujet des liens secondaires not\u00e9s plus haut, l\u2019ARC ajoute que de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on doit consid\u00e9rer les liens de r\u00e9sidence secondaires dans leur ensemble afin d'\u00e9valuer l'importance de chacun de ceux-ci. Il serait inhabituel qu'un seul lien de r\u00e9sidence secondaire avec le Canada soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant suffisamment important en soi pour conclure que le particulier est un r\u00e9sident de fait du Canada pendant qu'il est \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\n[43] Enfin, l\u2019ARC souligne que les tribunaux ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019autres crit\u00e8res pour d\u00e9terminer le statut de r\u00e9sidence d'un particulier pendant son absence du Canada et que l'ARC pourrait, elle aussi, prendre en compte, mentionnons : une adresse postale, un casier postal ou encore un coffre bancaire au Canada, un num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone au Canada ainsi qu'un abonnement \u00e0 des revues et journaux locaux (canadiens).\n[44] L\u2019affaire Reeder [8] a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une liste de crit\u00e8res factuels pour d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence :\n13 \u2026., les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui servaient dans ces arr\u00eats \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la question de fait de la r\u00e9sidence fiscale, s'appliquent aussi en l'esp\u00e8ce. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont notamment:\na. le genre de vie pass\u00e9 ou pr\u00e9sent;\nb. la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 et la dur\u00e9e des s\u00e9jours dans le ressort de la juridiction de la r\u00e9sidence;\nc. les liens dans le ressort de cette juridiction;\nd. les liens en d'autres lieux;\ne. le caract\u00e8re permanent ou autre des s\u00e9jours \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\nLa question des liens dans le ressort de la juridiction de r\u00e9sidence et en d'autres lieux englobe toute la gamme des rapports et des engagements d'une personne: biens et placements, emploi, famille, affaires, liens culturels et mondains en sont des exemples. Tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne seront pas retenus dans chaque cas. Ils doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du postulat que chacun doit avoir une r\u00e9sidence fiscale et qu'un individu peut avoir simultan\u00e9ment plus d'une r\u00e9sidence du point de vue fiscal.\n[45] Il est bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que la question de la r\u00e9sidence doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e selon les faits de chaque affaire. Ceci \u00e9tant, il y a amplement de jurisprudence qui consid\u00e8re les liens primaires et secondaire dont la dur\u00e9e des s\u00e9jours, les liens sociaux, familiaux et \u00e9conomiques [9].\n[46] Au final, dans une situation de pays conventionn\u00e9s comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, si chaque pays consid\u00e8re le contribuable comme r\u00e9sident selon son droit interne, c\u2019est la convention fiscale qui d\u00e9terminera le sort de la r\u00e9sidence dudit contribuable [10].\n[47] La matrice offerte par le juge Boyle dans l\u2019affaire Dysert [11] afin de d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence fiscale d\u2019un contribuable peuvent aux fins du cas pr\u00e9sent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi :\nA. Le premier point est de savoir si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un r\u00e9sident du Canada pour l\u2019application de la Loi. Deux volets sont \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette fin:\n(i) \u00c9tait\u2011il de fait un r\u00e9sident du Canada selon le sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce mot pour l\u2019application de la Loi?\n(ii) Alternativement, l\u2019appelant est-il r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 250(1)a) de la Loi, applicable aux personnes qui s\u00e9journent au Canada durant au moins 183 jours au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e?\nB. Si l\u2019on conclut que l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pour l\u2019application de la Loi, et que ce dernier r\u00e9side \u00e9galement au Cameroun, l\u2019analyse doit alors porter sur la Convention, et en particulier le paragraphe 4(2).\nb) R\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant\n[48] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la p\u00e9riode examin\u00e9e est du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019 (10 mois). Tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 plus haut, des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 seraient \u00e0 l\u2019origine du d\u00e9part de l\u2019appelant pour le Cameroun. L\u2019appelant a rejoint sa famille au Cameroun depuis le ou vers le 19 avril 2018 et reviendra au Canada le ou vers le 17 avril 2019.\n[49] La situation de la r\u00e9sidence fiscale au Canada de l\u2019appelant s\u2019est modifi\u00e9e depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2016 o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant a c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 son mariage au Cameroun et l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de 6 enfants mineurs \u00e0 charge. L\u2019appelant est revenu vivre au Canada bien que des liens importants \u00e9taient maintenant tiss\u00e9s avec le Cameroun alors notamment que sa conjointe et les enfants sont demeur\u00e9s sur place sans jamais visiter ce dernier.\n[50] Lorsqu\u2019au printemps 2018 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019appelant est prise sur recommandation de son m\u00e9decin de rejoindre sa famille au Cameroun pour se refaire une sant\u00e9, ses liens avec le Canada sont en quelques sortes r\u00e9organis\u00e9s pour le d\u00e9part. Il conserve des liens \u00e9conomiques bien qu\u2019ils ne soient pas mat\u00e9riels mais ces liens ne semblent pas n\u00e9cessairement diff\u00e9rents que lorsqu\u2019il est pr\u00e9sent au Canada. Il sous-loue son logement et entrepose des biens meubles. Le renouvellement de son contrat de bail couvrant la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de son d\u00e9part a un faible impact car il a autoris\u00e9 une sous-location pour toute la dur\u00e9e du terme du bail. Toutefois, il prend des mesures aupr\u00e8s de son ami M. Deumeni pour conserver un pied \u00e0 terre, y laisse des biens personnels, et effectue des changements d\u2019adresse \u00e0 cette nouvelle adresse. Il fait parvenir \u00e0 M. Deumeni quelques versements bancaires au cours des 5-6 premiers mois d\u2019absence pour couvrir des d\u00e9penses bien que la preuve ne supporte aucun contrat de location \u00e9crit intervenu entre les parties. Cependant, cette situation est confirm\u00e9e par M. Deumeni lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Par contre, rien n\u2019est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve depuis son retour au Canada en avril 2019.\n[51] La preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audition supporte que l\u2019appelant m\u00e8ne au Canada une vie somme toute simple, qui accepte et appr\u00e9cie ce que la vie lui pr\u00e9sente, bien que comme tous il cherche \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son sort. Il s\u2019occupe, il travail, fr\u00e9quente ses connaissances. La preuve n\u2019a pas soutenu un mode de vie \u00e9lev\u00e9 avec de multiples facettes. Donc, les liens de r\u00e9sidence avec le Canada n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus m\u00eame durant la p\u00e9riode accept\u00e9e par la Ministre.\n[52] L\u2019avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination dat\u00e9 du 3 mai 2019 visant l\u2019ann\u00e9e de base 2017 est l\u2019unique avis invoquant que l\u2019exigence en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite. 10 mois au total que couvrent l\u2019avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination sont relativement courts pour d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e9sidence fiscale canadienne jusque-l\u00e0 accept\u00e9e par la Ministre doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s avoir soupes\u00e9 les liens conserv\u00e9s au Canada, la fa\u00e7on dont ces liens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenus (adresse, liens \u00e9conomiques, demandes aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s, assurance-maladie), les liens que l\u2019appelant a accumul\u00e9s au Cameroun depuis son mariage, la Cour consid\u00e8re ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de conclure de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive que l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider au Canada au cours de ces 10 mois sous examens. La situation de l\u2019appelant au Canada est certes plus pr\u00e9caire au cours de cette p\u00e9riode mais les raisons primaires pour expliquer le s\u00e9jour, les liens qui demeurent au Canada et les circonstances expos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audition militent, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, au soutien d\u2019un lien de r\u00e9sidence au Canada aux fins de la Loi au cours de cette p\u00e9riode [12]. Chaque cas est un cas d\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[54] De plus, il ne doit pas \u00eatre oubli\u00e9 d\u2019apporter la consid\u00e9ration, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, que demande l\u2019alin\u00e9a 250(1)a) de la Loi :\nPersonne r\u00e9put\u00e9e r\u00e9sider au Canada\n250 (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, une personne est r\u00e9put\u00e9e, sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), avoir r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada tout au long d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition si :\na)elle a s\u00e9journ\u00e9 au Canada au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pendant une p\u00e9riode ou des p\u00e9riodes dont l\u2019ensemble est de 183 jours ou plus;\n(\u2026)\n[55] Cette pr\u00e9somption n\u2019a pas d\u2019impact pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2018 de l\u2019appelant consid\u00e9rant le nombre de jours s\u00e9journ\u00e9 au Cameroun au cours de cette ann\u00e9e. Toutefois, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2019, la situation est diff\u00e9rente puisque l\u2019appelant est revenu au Canada en avril 2019 et y a s\u00e9journ\u00e9 plus de 183 jours [13]. Cette pr\u00e9somption le r\u00e9pute, pour l\u2019application de l\u2019ensemble des dispositions de la Loi, avoir r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2019.\n[56] Ceci dit, une autre question se pose et la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question pourrait avoir comme effet de renverser la qualification de r\u00e9sidence au Canada puisque le paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi emp\u00eache dans un contexte o\u00f9 une convention fiscale existe qu\u2019un individu consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9sident du pays \u00e9tranger aux fins de ladite convention soit \u00e9galement un r\u00e9sident du Canada aux fins de la Loi.\n[57] La Cour note que la teneur du droit camerounais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019audition. En vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada [14], l\u2019article 2809 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec [15], faisant partie du Livre septi\u00e8me - De la preuve, s\u2019applique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\nLe tribunal peut prendre connaissance d\u2019office du droit des autres provinces ou territoires du Canada et du droit d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e9tranger, pourvu qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Il peut aussi demander que la preuve en soit faite, laquelle peut l\u2019\u00eatre, entre autres, par le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert ou par la production d\u2019un certificat \u00e9tabli par un jurisconsulte.\nLorsque ce droit n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que sa teneur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il applique le droit en vigueur au Qu\u00e9bec.\n(notre soulignement)\n[58] Dans ce contexte, les m\u00eames crit\u00e8res et dispositions l\u00e9gislatives aux fins de d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence fiscale d\u2019une personne physique au Canada peuvent donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9rer dans les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre un r\u00e9sident fiscal du Cameroun aux fins de la Convention [16]. Si l\u2019appelant d\u00e9tient \u00e9galement une r\u00e9sidence fiscale au Cameroun, la Cour devra \u00e9galement d\u00e9terminer si la r\u00e8gle d\u00e9cisive de la d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9sidence fiscale du paragraphe 4(2) de la Convention le reconna\u00eet un r\u00e9sident fiscal du Cameroun aux fins de la Convention de sorte que par l\u2019effet du paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi l\u2019appelant sera au final consid\u00e9r\u00e9 un non-r\u00e9sident du Canada aux fins de la Loi.\n[59] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen de la situation dans lequel se trouve l\u2019appelant au cours de la p\u00e9riode en appel, les dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 250(1)a) de la Loi et les crit\u00e8res d\u00e9terminants une r\u00e9sidence fiscale factuelle militent en faveur d\u2019un r\u00e9sidence fiscale de l\u2019appelant au Cameroun plus particuli\u00e8rement aux fins de la p\u00e9riode du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019. Certes la dur\u00e9e du s\u00e9jour de l\u2019appelant au Cameroun exc\u00e9dant 183 jours en 2018 permet conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 250(1)a) de constater un statut de r\u00e9sident fiscal au Cameroun pour 2018, mais le m\u00eame constat est retenu pour la dur\u00e9e totale du s\u00e9jour au Cameroun en 2018 et 2019 en raison des r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9sidence factuelle applicables aux fins fiscales canadiennes. Les facteurs retenues cette fois par la Cour \u00e0 la question de d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence factuelle de l\u2019appelant durant la p\u00e9riode sont les liens qui ont pris naissance depuis le mariage de l\u2019appelant en juillet 2016 au Cameroun, la pr\u00e9sence continue de sa conjointe et des enfants \u00e0 charge \u00e0 tout moment pertinent au Cameroun, les liens \u00e9conomiques qu\u2019il a cr\u00e9\u00e9s au Cameroun (location, achat d\u2019un lot de terre, la responsabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses d\u2019entretien et d\u2019usage de la r\u00e9sidence familiale au Cameroun, la pr\u00e9sence continue d\u2019un foyer au Cameroun avec la famille), et du m\u00eame coup les liens factuels r\u00e9duits au Canada.\n[60] La d\u00e9termination du statut fiscal aux fins canadiennes et camerounaises aux fins du pr\u00e9sent appel fait en sorte qu\u2019un statut de r\u00e9sidence fiscale dans les deux pays coexiste. La situation n\u2019a pas lieu d\u2019\u00eatre et doit donc \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en vertu des dispositions applicables de la Convention.\n[61] L\u2019article 4 de la Convention contient une r\u00e8gle d\u00e9cisive de la d\u00e9termination du statut de r\u00e9sidence fiscale d\u2019un individu :\nArticle 4\nR\u00e9sident\nAu sens de la pr\u00e9sente Convention, l\u2019expression \u00ab r\u00e9sident d\u2019un \u00c9tat contractant \u00bb d\u00e9signe toute personne qui, en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation de cet \u00c9tat, est assujettie \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans cet \u00c9tat, en raison de son domicile, de sa r\u00e9sidence, de son si\u00e8ge de direction ou de tout autre crit\u00e8re de nature analogue.\nLorsque, selon les dispositions du paragraphe 1, une personne physique est un r\u00e9sident des deux \u00c9tats contractants, sa situation est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\ncette personne est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat o\u00f9 elle dispose d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent; si elle dispose d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent dans les deux \u00c9tats, elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat avec lequel ses liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques sont les plus \u00e9troits (centre des int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux);\nsi l\u2019\u00c9tat o\u00f9 cette personne a le centre de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux ne peut pas \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ou si elle ne dispose d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent dans aucun des \u00c9tats, elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat o\u00f9 elle s\u00e9journe de fa\u00e7on habituelle;\n(\u2026)\n[62] Le paragraphe 4(2) de la Convention entre en jeu lorsque l\u2019individu est un r\u00e9sident des deux \u00c9tats contractants aux fins de la convention applicable.\n[63] Les commentaires sur l\u2019article 4 du Mod\u00e8le de Convention fiscale concernant le revenu et la fortune (version 2017) de l\u2019OCDE, sur lequel est fond\u00e9 l\u2019article 4 de la Convention, incluent les points suivants :\n4. Les conventions de double imposition ne se pr\u00e9occupent pas en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des l\u00e9gislations internes des \u00c9tats contractants ayant pour objet de d\u00e9finir les conditions dans lesquelles une personne est reconnue, au point de vue fiscal, comme \u00ab r\u00e9sident \u00bb d\u2019un \u00c9tat et est par cons\u00e9quent assujettie int\u00e9gralement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans cet \u00c9tat. Ces conventions ne pr\u00e9cisent pas les crit\u00e8res auxquels doivent r\u00e9pondre les dispositions des l\u00e9gislations internes sur la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb pour que les \u00c9tats contractants reconnaissent \u00e0 l\u2019un d\u2019entre eux le droit d\u2019assujettissement int\u00e9gral. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les \u00c9tats arr\u00eatent leur position en se fondant uniquement sur leur l\u00e9gislation interne.\n5. On peut facilement s\u2019en rendre compte lorsqu\u2019il y a conflit non pas entre deux r\u00e9sidences, mais entre la r\u00e9sidence et la source ou le situs. Toutefois, les m\u00eames consid\u00e9rations s\u2019appliquent en cas de conflit entre deux r\u00e9sidences. Dans ce dernier cas, il faut cependant noter que l\u2019on ne peut parvenir \u00e0 une solution du conflit en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la notion de r\u00e9sidence adopt\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislation interne des \u00c9tats consid\u00e9r\u00e9s. Des clauses sp\u00e9ciales doivent \u00eatre ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la Convention pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 laquelle des deux notions de r\u00e9sidence il convient d\u2019accorder la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n6. Un exemple permettra de mieux comprendre la situation. L\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 poss\u00e8de un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent dans l\u2019\u00c9tat A o\u00f9 vivent sa femme et ses enfants. Il a s\u00e9journ\u00e9 plus de six mois dans l\u2019\u00c9tat B o\u00f9, en vertu du droit interne dudit \u00c9tat, il est, en raison de la dur\u00e9e de son s\u00e9jour, imposable, car consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un r\u00e9sident de cet \u00c9tat. Deux \u00c9tats revendiquent alors le droit de l\u2019assujettir int\u00e9gralement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Ce conflit doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9 par la Convention.\n7. Dans ce cas particulier, l\u2019article (en vertu des dispositions du paragraphe 2) donne la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat A. Il ne faut toutefois pas en d\u00e9duire que l\u2019article pose des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales sur la \u00ab r\u00e9sidence \u00bb et qu\u2019on ne tient pas compte de la l\u00e9gislation interne de l\u2019\u00c9tat B du fait qu\u2019elle est incompatible avec ces r\u00e8gles. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, dans un conflit de ce genre, il importe \u00e9videmment de faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019une des deux revendications, et c\u2019est \u00e0 ce sujet que l\u2019article propose des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales.\n[\u2026]\n9. Le paragraphe [le paragraphe 4(2)] vise le cas o\u00f9, en vertu des dispositions du paragraphe 1, une personne physique est un r\u00e9sident des deux \u00c9tats contractants.\n10. Pour r\u00e9soudre ce conflit, il faut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales qui donnent la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance aux liens rattachant le contribuable \u00e0 un \u00c9tat plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019autre. Dans la mesure du possible, le crit\u00e8re de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence doit \u00eatre tel qu\u2019il ne fasse pas de doute que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 ne remplit les conditions requises que dans un \u00c9tat seulement; en m\u00eame temps, le crit\u00e8re devra \u00eatre tel que le lien retenu fasse para\u00eetre normale l\u2019attribution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat consid\u00e9r\u00e9 du droit de lever l\u2019imp\u00f4t. Les faits auxquels s\u2019appliqueront les r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales sont ceux qui pr\u00e9valent au cours de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle la r\u00e9sidence du contribuable a une incidence sur son assujettissement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t, p\u00e9riode qui peut \u00eatre d\u2019une dur\u00e9e moindre que celle d\u2019une p\u00e9riode d\u2019imposition enti\u00e8re. Par exemple, au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e civile, un particulier r\u00e9side dans un \u00c9tat A, selon la l\u00e9gislation fiscale de cet \u00c9tat du 1er janvier au 31 mars, puis il se rend dans l\u2019\u00c9tat B. Comme il r\u00e9side dans l\u2019\u00c9tat B plus de 183 jours, il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislation fiscale de l\u2019\u00c9tat B comme r\u00e9sident de cet \u00c9tat pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. Si l\u2019on applique les r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er janvier au 31 mars, le particulier \u00e9tait r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat A. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019\u00c9tat A comme l\u2019\u00c9tat B devraient traiter ce particulier comme un r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat A pour cette p\u00e9riode, et comme un r\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00c9tat B du 1er avril au 31 d\u00e9cembre.\n11. L\u2019article accorde la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat contractant o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dispose d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent. Ce crit\u00e8re suffira souvent pour r\u00e9soudre le conflit r\u00e9sultant du fait qu\u2019une personne qui a un foyer permanent dans un \u00c9tat contractant a seulement effectu\u00e9 un s\u00e9jour d\u2019une certaine dur\u00e9e dans l\u2019autre \u00c9tat contractant.\n12. L\u2019alin\u00e9a a) veut donc dire que, pour l\u2019application de la Convention (donc lorsqu\u2019il y a conflit entre les l\u00e9gislations des deux \u00c9tats) on consid\u00e8re que la r\u00e9sidence de la personne physique se trouve l\u00e0 o\u00f9 celle\u2011ci a la possession ou la jouissance d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation, \u00e0 condition que ce dernier soit permanent, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que la personne l\u2019ait am\u00e9nag\u00e9 et r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 son usage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re durable, par opposition au fait du s\u00e9jour \u00e0 un certain endroit dans des conditions telles que ce s\u00e9jour apparaisse comme devant \u00eatre limit\u00e9 \u00e0 une courte dur\u00e9e.\n13. Au sujet de la notion de foyer d\u2019habitation, il faut observer que toute forme d\u2019habitation peut \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration (maison ou appartement qui est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 ou pris en location, chambre meubl\u00e9e lou\u00e9e). Mais la permanence de l\u2019habitation est essentielle, ce qui signifie que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 fait le n\u00e9cessaire pour avoir le logement \u00e0 sa disposition en tout temps, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re continue et pas occasionnellement pour effectuer un s\u00e9jour qui, compte tenu des raisons qui le motivaient, est n\u00e9cessairement li\u00e9 \u00e0 une courte dur\u00e9e (voyage d\u2019agr\u00e9ment, voyage d\u2019affaires, voyage d\u2019\u00e9tudes, stage dans une \u00e9cole, etc.).\n14. Si la personne physique poss\u00e8de un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent dans les deux \u00c9tats contractants, le paragraphe 2 donne la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat avec lequel ses liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques sont les plus \u00e9troits, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat dans lequel se trouve le centre des int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019il est impossible de d\u00e9terminer la r\u00e9sidence en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux dispositions mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus, le paragraphe 2 pr\u00e9voit des crit\u00e8res secondaires qui sont d\u2019abord le s\u00e9jour habituel, ensuite la nationalit\u00e9. Si une personne physique poss\u00e8de la nationalit\u00e9 des deux \u00c9tats ou n\u2019a la nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019aucun d\u2019eux, la question devra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e d\u2019un commun accord entre les administrations int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019article 25.\n15. Lorsque la personne physique a un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent dans les deux \u00c9tats contractants, il y a lieu de rechercher dans les faits celui des deux \u00c9tats avec lequel les liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques sont les plus \u00e9troits. Seront ainsi pris en consid\u00e9ration les relations familiales et sociales de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9, ses occupations, ses activit\u00e9s politiques, culturelles ou autres, le si\u00e8ge de ses affaires, le lieu d\u2019o\u00f9 il administre ses biens, etc. Les circonstances doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es dans leur ensemble ; mais il est \u00e9vident cependant que les consid\u00e9rations tir\u00e9es du comportement personnel de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 doivent sp\u00e9cialement retenir l\u2019attention. Si une personne qui a une habitation dans un \u00c9tat \u00e9tablit une deuxi\u00e8me habitation dans un autre \u00c9tat, tout en conservant la premi\u00e8re, le fait que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 conserve cette premi\u00e8re habitation dans le milieu o\u00f9 il a toujours v\u00e9cu, o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 et o\u00f9 il garde sa famille et ses biens peut, avec d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments, contribuer \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a conserv\u00e9 le centre de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux dans le premier \u00c9tat.\n[64] Le premier crit\u00e8re est donc de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant dispose d\u2019un foyer d\u2019habitation permanent. Aux fins d\u2019appliquer le test de la Convention \u00e0 cette fin, les commentaires de l\u2019OCDE au paragraphe 13 plus haut attirent l\u2019attention sur le caract\u00e8re que le foyer d\u2019habitation doit avoir, la permanence de l\u2019habitation est essentielle, ce qui signifie que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 fait le n\u00e9cessaire pour avoir le logement \u00e0 sa disposition en tout temps, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re continue et pas occasionnellement pour effectuer un s\u00e9jour. Cette caract\u00e9ristique est primordiale.\n[65] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, bien que l\u2019appelant ait pu obtenir une adresse au Canada pendant son s\u00e9jour au Cameroun, la Cour n\u2019est pas convaincu que la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019arrangement avec M. Deumeni a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019audition permet d\u2019assurer l\u2019id\u00e9e de permanence de l\u2019habitation au Canada tel que d\u00e9finie aux fins de la Convention \u00e0 savoir pouvoir disposer du logement en tout temps, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re continue, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019occasionnellement durant la p\u00e9riode consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas de contrat de location formel avec M. Deumeni, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019habiter en permanence avec M. Deumeni ou sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re pendant une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou encore disposer \u00e0 sa convenance des lieus lou\u00e9s de M. Deumeni. En fait, l\u2019appelant a effectu\u00e9 6 versements bancaires irr\u00e9gulier au total, et n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 en fait \u00e0 habiter avec M. Deumeni qu\u2019\u00e0 son retour en avril 2019 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son d\u00e9part en juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Pour la Cour rien n\u2019est moins certain que malgr\u00e9 la bonne volont\u00e9 de M. Deumeni que l\u2019arrangement offrait quelque garantie \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019habiter les lieux en tout temps, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re continue, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019occasionnellement durant la p\u00e9riode consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Au final, aux fins du test de la Convention, la Cour n\u2019est pas convaincue de l\u2019aspect permanent dont pouvait disposer l\u2019appelant au Canada.\n[66] Si la Cour devait \u00eatre erron\u00e9e quant \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re, la Convention requiert de d\u00e9terminer o\u00f9 se trouve le centre des int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux de l\u2019appelant durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente. Le pays avec lequel les liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 sont les plus \u00e9troits est d\u00e9fini comme le centre des int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux du contribuable. \u00c0 cette fin, la Cour partage la conclusion du juge Boyle dans l\u2019affaire Dysert \u00e0 savoir que le contribuable ne peut avoir \u00e0 cette fin plus d\u2019un centre de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux compte tenu de l\u2019expression \u00ab les plus \u00e9troits \u00bb, m\u00eame si, dans un cas ou un autre, ce centre n\u2019est peut\u2011\u00eatre pas v\u00e9rifiable. Le juge Boyle ajoute :\n[72] Il est clair que les mots \u00ab les liens les plus \u00e9troits \u00bb ne signifient pas \u00ab les liens les plus nombreux \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une notion relative, et non d\u2019une notion m\u00e9canique ou arithm\u00e9tique. L\u2019\u00e9troitesse des liens existants exige qu\u2019une attention particuli\u00e8re soit port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue et \u00e0 la nature des liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques. Cette id\u00e9e trouve un appui explicite au paragraphe 15 des Commentaires de l\u2019OCDE, en particulier si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019exemple donn\u00e9 dans la derni\u00e8re phrase de ce paragraphe.\n[73] Dans la d\u00e9cision Hertel v. Minister of National Revenue, 93 DTC 721, le juge Sobier s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 ainsi :\n14 Pour d\u00e9terminer le centre des int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux, il ne suffit pas de soupeser ou de d\u00e9nombrer les facteurs o\u00f9 les liens dans chaque \u00c9tat. Il faut chercher \u00e0 savoir, et cela importe plus que le nombre, avec quel \u00c9tat la personne a les liens les plus \u00e9troits.\nCe passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 par le juge O\u2019Connor, de la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, dans la d\u00e9cision Yoon c. La Reine, 2005 CCI 366.\n[67] Aux fins de cette d\u00e9termination, la Cour retient dans le cas pr\u00e9sent que l\u2019appelant a des liens personnels forts avec le Cameroun et cela se comprend par la pr\u00e9sence dans ce pays de sa famille o\u00f9 elle vit en permanence et dont il est tr\u00e8s fier. Au Cameroun, il d\u00e9tient notamment un bail (aucune preuve contraire quant \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e du bail n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, a fortiori sa famille s\u2019y trouve toujours) et un lot. Sans nier que l\u2019appelant a des liens personnels et \u00e9conomiques au Canada durant la p\u00e9riode, le Cameroun pr\u00e9sente l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ces liens sont les plus \u00e9troits. La preuve supporte sur la balance des probabilit\u00e9s cette conclusion. Un seul pays peut l\u2019emporter aux fins du test, et il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une notion relative, et non d\u2019une notion m\u00e9canique ou arithm\u00e9tique.\n[68] La Cour rappelle que le test ou la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre de la Convention appliqu\u00e9 plus haut n\u2019a pas pour but de trancher le dilemme de la r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 partir des m\u00eames r\u00e8gles et crit\u00e8res qui ont permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir une r\u00e9sidence fiscale aux fins domestiques. Le test retenu par la Convention est en soi \u00e9labor\u00e9 afin de trancher d\u00e9finitivement et sur de nouvelles bases la r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un individu entre les deux pays. En finalit\u00e9, les crit\u00e8res retenus aux fins de cette d\u00e9termination n\u2019offrent pas d\u2019incertitude sur la d\u00e9termination \u00e0 retenir. La recherche d\u2019une d\u00e9termination unique de la r\u00e9sidence entre les 2 pays est clairement vis\u00e9e, et une fois d\u00e9termin\u00e9e les cons\u00e9quences fiscales domestiques \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en d\u00e9coulent.\n[69] Consid\u00e9rant l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour est d\u2019avis que les dispositions du paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi s\u2019applique et r\u00e9pute l\u2019appelant ne pas r\u00e9sider au Canada au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente et plus particuli\u00e8rement la p\u00e9riode du 1er juillet 2018 au 30 avril 2019 vis\u00e9e par l\u2019avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination dat\u00e9 du 3 mai 2019.\nC. Statut aux fins de l\u2019ACE\n[70] Aux fins de l\u2019ACE, la question en litige vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant a satisfait aux alin\u00e9as 122.6(1)a), b) et c) de la Loi de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible au cours de la P\u00e9riode en litige. Le 20 mars 2019, la Ministre a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 l\u2019ACE pour les mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 \u00e0 juin 2017 (ann\u00e9e de base 2015), de juillet 2017 \u00e0 juin 2018 (ann\u00e9e de base 2016) et de juillet 2018 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2019 (ann\u00e9e de base 2017). Consid\u00e9rant que la Ministre a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant est d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9sident au Canada aux fins des ann\u00e9es de base 2015 et 2016 puisque le CTPS de base lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 aux avis de nouvelle d\u00e9termination dat\u00e9 du 5 mars 2019, il semble plus appropri\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer les alin\u00e9as 122.6(1)a) et b) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible dans un premier temps puisque ces conditions visent toute la dur\u00e9e d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2016 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2019, et que le d\u00e9faut de rencontrer l\u2019une d\u2019entre elle suffit \u00e0 disposer de la question en litige.\n[71] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)a) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible, qui requiert que l\u2019appelant r\u00e9side avec les enfants \u00e0 charge, \u00e9tablit un lien \u00e9troit avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)c) de la m\u00eame d\u00e9finition qui lui requiert que l\u2019appelant r\u00e9side au Canada. En effet, bien que l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re pas \u00e0 \u00ab r\u00e9side au Canada \u00bb tout comme \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a c), il appara\u00eet clair d\u2019accorder \u00e0 l\u2019action de \u00ab r\u00e9sider \u00bb le m\u00eame sens aux fins des alin\u00e9as a) et c) de la d\u00e9finition. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) ne fait qu\u2019ajouter le lieu o\u00f9 l\u2019action de r\u00e9sider doit s\u2019\u00e9tablir. Et une fois de plus, rappelons que tous les alin\u00e9as de la d\u00e9finition doivent \u00eatre rencontr\u00e9s au m\u00eame moment.\n[72] En cons\u00e9quence, consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible oblige clairement l\u2019appelant \u00e0 r\u00e9sider au Canada, ce dernier ne peut donc rencontrer la condition de l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) qu\u2019en r\u00e9sidant au Canada avec les enfants. Lors de son introduction le 24 f\u00e9vrier 1998, l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) ne mentionnait que les mots \u00ab elle [la personne] r\u00e9side au Canada \u00bb. Les amendements subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) n\u2019ont pas modifi\u00e9s cette exigence. Des notes techniques d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en mars 1999 par le minist\u00e8re des Finances du Canada concernant l\u2019article 122.6 de la Loi indiquait au sujet du sens \u00e0 donner au particulier admissible :\nAn \u201celigible individual\u201d in respect of a qualified dependant is generally the person who resides with the dependant in Canada and is the dependant's principal care provider. It is presumed that the female parent of a qualified dependant is the eligible individual if she resides with the dependant.\n(notre soulignement)\n[73] Aussi, quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible, il doit \u00eatre not\u00e9 que le paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi stipule qu\u2019un r\u00e9sidant du Canada ne peut \u00e0 la fois r\u00e9sider au Canada aux fins de la Loi et r\u00e9sider dans un pays conventionn\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019en vertu des dispositions de la convention fiscale intervenue entre le Canada et ce pays les r\u00e8gles d\u00e9cisives qui y sont contenues \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019il est un r\u00e9sident de ce pays aux fins de la convention. En d\u2019autres mots, le paragraphe 250(5) ne permet pas \u00e0 un individu de pouvoir d\u00e9clarer \u00eatre r\u00e9sident au Canada aux fins fiscales canadiennes alors qu\u2019une convention fiscale intervenue entre le Canada et un pays tiers d\u00e9termine d\u00e9finitivement qu\u2019il est un r\u00e9sident fiscal de l\u2019autre pays.\n[74] La revue de la condition de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)c) pr\u00e9sente donc dans le cas pr\u00e9sent une dichotomie avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) car si la condition \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)a) discut\u00e9e plus haut est satisfaite la situation signifie que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un r\u00e9sident du Cameroun aux fins de la Convention, car la r\u00e9sidence des enfants n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre au Cameroun. Dans un tel cas, l\u2019appelant est forclos de r\u00e9clamer un statut de r\u00e9sident au Canada en raison du paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi aux fins de satisfaire la condition de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible. Cette situation fait en sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019issue favorable pour l\u2019appelant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive le statut de r\u00e9sidence aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) et de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACE.\n[75] L\u2019action de r\u00e9sider ensemble ou encore avec l\u2019autre inf\u00e8re que ceux et celles vis\u00e9s par l\u2019action satisfont \u00e0 la condition \u00e0 partir g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u2019un m\u00eame situs. Dans ce cas-ci, ce situs ne peut \u00eatre qu\u2019au Canada ou au Cameroun. Et il y a peu de place \u00e0 l\u2019ambig\u00fcit\u00e9 puisque les enfants sont en tout temps physiquement sous le m\u00eame toit au Cameroun, et en aucun temps ou moment au Canada. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la preuve soutient que l\u2019appelant ne peut pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il r\u00e9sidait avec les enfants que lorsqu\u2019il se trouvait au Cameroun avec eux, les enfants n\u2019ayant jamais quitt\u00e9 le Cameroun pour le Canada pour quelque dur\u00e9e que ce soit avant ou au cours de la P\u00e9riode en litige. La r\u00e9sidence requiert une certaine constance, une certaine r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou encore d'une mani\u00e8re habituelle [17]. Ici aucune ambig\u00fcit\u00e9 n\u2019existe, les enfants r\u00e9sident au Cameroun.\n[76] Si l\u2019appelant est \u00e0 bon droit comme il le pr\u00e9tend un r\u00e9sidant au Canada aux fins de la Loi et de la Convention tout au long de la P\u00e9riode en litige, incluant au moment de sa pr\u00e9sence au Cameroun d\u2019avril 2018 \u00e0 avril 2019, sa pr\u00e9sence au Cameroun ne ferait pas de lui un r\u00e9sident du Cameroun aux fins la convention fiscale Canada-Cameroun. Dans un tel cas, il s\u00e9journe au Cameroun certes mais sans modifier son statut de r\u00e9sidence fiscale. Par cons\u00e9quent, si l\u2019appelant r\u00e9side au Canada aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible, il n\u2019est pas en mesure de satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) sur ces m\u00eames assises et r\u00e9sider avec les enfants puisqu\u2019ils ne sont jamais entr\u00e9s au Canada. L\u2019inverse est aussi vrai. Si l\u2019appelant devait s\u2019av\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sident du Cameroun aux fins de la Convention fiscale Canada-Cameroun, le paragraphe 250(5) de la Loi r\u00e9pute l\u2019appelant un non-r\u00e9sident du Canada, et donc dans ce cas c\u2019est l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) qui fait d\u00e9faut.\n[77] En d\u2019autres mots, l\u2019appelant se retrouve dans une situation o\u00f9 il est dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de rencontrer \u00e0 la fois l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) et l\u2019alin\u00e9a c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 son statut de r\u00e9sident ou non-r\u00e9sident aux fins de la Loi.\n[78] Le statut de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 titre de particulier admissible aux fins de l\u2019ACE cause donc un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)a) de la d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 cet effet, puisqu\u2019ultimement l\u2019unique endroit o\u00f9 la condition peut \u00eatre satisfaite est au Cameroun.\n[79] De plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible cause \u00e9galement un probl\u00e8me. La Cour n\u2019est pas convaincue que l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9ussi par pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 renverser la pr\u00e9somption de l\u2019alin\u00e9a f) de la m\u00eame d\u00e9finition qui \u00e9tablit que si l\u2019enfant r\u00e9side avec sa m\u00e8re, la personne qui assume principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de la personne \u00e0 charge est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00eatre la m\u00e8re. Les parties ont limit\u00e9s la contestation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) de la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer qui de l\u2019appelant ou de sa conjointe assumait principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation des six enfants vivants avec la conjointe au Cameroun. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une personne autre que l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019ACE. De plus, la Cour retient de la position de l\u2019appelant que sa participation \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants est essentiellement mon\u00e9taire : il effectue des virements bancaires \u00e0 sa conjointe au Cameroun pour subvenir aux besoins et aux soins de la famille.\n[80] Pour satisfaire la condition de l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible, la Cour ne croit pas que la preuve a contredit la contribution financi\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant. Une lettre de la conjointe confirmant le soutien financier de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Cette lettre non-contredite confirme \u00e9galement que la conjointe est femme au foyer s\u2019occupant du suivi des enfants. La contribution \u00e9conomique demeure r\u00e9elle et soutenue. Toutefois, suffit-elle dans les circonstances lorsque les enfants sont constamment avec la conjointe de l\u2019appelant, qu\u2019elle s\u2019occupe des enfants, pose les gestes quotidiens, s\u2019assure de prodiguer une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et une pr\u00e9sence quotidienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute des enfants? Autant de gestes que l\u2019appelant ne peut assumer consid\u00e9rant les circonstances.\n[81] La contribution financi\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant est certes non n\u00e9gligeable et justifie une contribution \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation et au soin des enfants. Cependant, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)h) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible dicte que pour les fins de d\u00e9terminer en quoi consiste le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019une personne l\u2019article 6302 du R\u00e8glement de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, CRC, c 945 (R\u00e8glement) d\u00e9termine les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 retenir :\n6302 Pour l\u2019application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a h) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible \u00e0 l\u2019article 122.6 de la Loi, les crit\u00e8res suivants servent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer en quoi consistent le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019une personne \u00e0 charge admissible :\na) le fait de surveiller les activit\u00e9s quotidiennes de la personne \u00e0 charge admissible et de voir \u00e0 ses besoins quotidiens;\nb) le maintien d\u2019un milieu s\u00e9curitaire l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9side;\nc) l\u2019obtention de soins m\u00e9dicaux pour elle \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers et en cas de besoin, ainsi que son transport aux endroits o\u00f9 ces soins sont offerts;\nd) l\u2019organisation pour elle d\u2019activit\u00e9s \u00e9ducatives, r\u00e9cr\u00e9atives, athl\u00e9tiques ou semblables, sa participation \u00e0 de telles activit\u00e9s et son transport \u00e0 cette fin;\ne) le fait de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins lorsqu\u2019elle est malade ou a besoin de l\u2019assistance d\u2019une autre personne;\nf) le fait de veiller \u00e0 son hygi\u00e8ne corporelle de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re;\ng) de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle et de la guider;\nh) l\u2019existence d\u2019une ordonnance rendue \u00e0 son \u00e9gard par un tribunal qui est valide dans la juridiction o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9side.\nNotre soulignement\n[82] Consid\u00e9rant les circonstances et la preuve telle qu\u2019\u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la Cour est d\u2019avis que les paragraphes a), b), c), d), e), f) et g) du R\u00e8glement 6302 sont favorables \u00e0 la position de madame, alors que l\u2019appelant obtient une partie du cr\u00e9dit en vertu des paragraphes b) et c) [18]. Dans ce contexte global, combin\u00e9e \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9somption de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)f), madame demeure dans le cas pr\u00e9sent la personne qui assume principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants \u00e0 charge.\n[83] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas soumis de d\u00e9cisions qui pouvaient soutenir qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de ces crit\u00e8res visait essentiellement l\u2019aspect financier permettant de supporter l\u2019accomplissement des actions qui sont d\u00e9crites au R\u00e8glement 6302. \u00c0 la face m\u00eame du libell\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au R\u00e8glement 6302, le texte sugg\u00e8re davantage un accent sur la personne qui assure les soins, qui pose les gestes et les actions aupr\u00e8s des enfants. La pr\u00e9sence physique de la personne appara\u00eet centrale dans la d\u00e9termination de la personne qui assume la responsabilit\u00e9 des soins et l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Ces crit\u00e8res ne sont pas les seuls, et l\u2019aspect financier m\u00e9rite une consid\u00e9ration. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les facteurs et la preuve au dossier il appara\u00eet tr\u00e8s difficile pour la Cour de ne pas accorder, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, cette responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la conjointe de l\u2019appelant. Bien que la pr\u00e9somption \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)f) de la Loi soit r\u00e9futable [19], l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 convaincre la Cour selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 122.6(1)b) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait par ce dernier.\n[84] Dans l\u2019affaire Pantelidis [20], le juge Pizzitelli a indiqu\u00e9 que la situation financi\u00e8re respective des parents n\u2019est pas un des facteurs dont il faut directement tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer quel parent assume principalement la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le soin et l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants. Il ne semble pas par ailleurs exister de d\u00e9cision o\u00f9 la seule contribution financi\u00e8re d\u2019un des parents fut suffisante pour pencher la balance en leur faveur.\n[85] Dans l\u2019affaire Picard [21], la m\u00e8re demeurait \u00e0 180 km de son enfant qui r\u00e9sidait avec le p\u00e8re, mais c\u2019est elle qui d\u00e9frayait tous les couts en lien avec l\u2019enfant et elle demeurait une source principale de support morale et spirituelle. Il fut d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que cette contribution \u00e9tait insuffisante pour qu\u2019elle soit le parent principalement responsable des soins et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de l\u2019enfant puisqu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9sidait pas avec elle.\n[86] Dans l\u2019affaire Simard [22], bien que le p\u00e8re ait plus de moyens et contribuait plus financi\u00e8rement au soin et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants, la m\u00e8re \u00e9tait le particulier admissible puisque c\u2019est chez-elle que les enfants passaient le plus de leur temps libre et c\u2019\u00e9tait leur maison.\n[87] En conclusion, l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pour l\u2019appelant de rencontrer les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de particulier admissible aux fins de l\u2019ACE durant la P\u00e9riode en litige est r\u00e9elle. La situation de l\u2019appelant face aux conditions a), b) et c) de la d\u00e9finition de particulier admissible aux fins de l\u2019ACE est telle qu\u2019il ne s\u2019av\u00e8re pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer autrement le statut de r\u00e9sident fiscal de l\u2019appelant au Canada durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\nVII.

La Cour doit d\u00e9terminer si M. Ubartas a occup\u00e9 un emploi assurable en 2020 et en 2021. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si M. Ubartas \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services ou, un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant ou travailleur autonome ayant conclu un contrat d\u2019entreprise avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour laquelle il travaillait.\nI. Pr\u00e9cis\n[2] M. Ubartas \u00e9tait un b\u00fbcheron, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un abatteur manuel et un d\u00e9busqueur ou op\u00e9rateur de d\u00e9busqueuse, travaillant pour le Groupement forestier de Portneuf (\u00ab GFP \u00bb) depuis 2015. Il a effectu\u00e9 ce genre de travail pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es ailleurs avant de commencer \u00e0 travailler pour le GFP. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que, lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le GFP, il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 et que son employeur le traitait constamment comme tel. La question se limite donc en grande partie \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu un changement important dans les conditions en vertu desquelles M. Ubartas a travaill\u00e9 pour le GFP en 2020 et\/ou en 2021.\n[3] Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 23 novembre 2022, le ministre du Revenu national a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la relation de M. Ubartas avec le GFP n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas une d\u2019employeur-employ\u00e9 et qu\u2019il n\u2019occupait donc pas un emploi assurable. M. Ubartas interjette appel de cette d\u00e9cision selon laquelle il n\u2019y avait pas de lien de subordination entre le GFP et M. Ubartas.\nII. Norme de contr\u00f4le\n[4] La norme de contr\u00f4le applicable dans le cas qui nous occupe est celle de savoir si la conclusion du ministre a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit et si elle est raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve dont il disposait et dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie la Cour. Voir, par exemple, les arr\u00eats de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale intitul\u00e9s L\u00e9gar\u00e9 c. Canada, (1999) no A-392-98 et P\u00e9russe c.

M.R.N., 2005 CCI 291 (le juge Bowie).\n[5] Pour les motifs qui suivent, l\u2019appel est accueilli et la d\u00e9cision du ministre selon laquelle M. Ubartas n\u2019occupait pas un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s du GFP en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019employeur est modifi\u00e9e afin de tenir compte du fait que M. Ubartas occupait un emploi assurable aupr\u00e8s du GFP.\nIII. Le droit applicable\nLoi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi\n[6] L\u2019expression \u00ab emploi assurable \u00bb au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE) est d\u00e9finie comme suit \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(1)a) de cette loi :\nEMPLOI ASSURABLE\n5. (1) Sens de \u00ab emploi assurable \u00bb \u2014 Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), est un emploi assurable :\na) l\u2019emploi exerc\u00e9 au Canada pour un ou plusieurs employeurs, aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services ou d\u2019apprentissage expr\u00e8s ou tacite, \u00e9crit ou verbal, que l\u2019employ\u00e9 re\u00e7oive sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de l\u2019employeur ou d\u2019une autre personne et que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit calcul\u00e9e soit au temps ou aux pi\u00e8ces, soit en partie au temps et en partie aux pi\u00e8ces, soit de toute autre mani\u00e8re;\nINSURABLE EMPLOYMENT\n5. (1) Type of insurance employment \u2014 Subject to subsection (2), insurable employment is\n(a) employment in Canada by one or more employers, under any express or implied contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether the earnings of the employed person are received from the employer or some other person and whether the earnings are calculated by time or by the piece, or partly by time and partly by the piece, or otherwise;\n[7] L\u2019article 2085 du Code civil du Qu\u00e9bec (le \u00ab Code civil \u00bb) d\u00e9finit l\u2019expression \u00ab contrat de travail \u00bb comme suit :\nCode civil du Qu\u00e9bec\nCHAPITRE SEPTI\u00c8ME\nDU CONTRAT DE TRAVAIL\nArt. 2085. Le contrat de travail est celui par lequel une personne, le salari\u00e9, s\u2019oblige, pour un temps limit\u00e9 et moyennant r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, \u00e0 effectuer un travail sous la direction ou le contr\u00f4le d\u2019une autre personne, l\u2019employeur.\nCHAPTER VII\nCONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT\nArt. 2085. A contract of employment is a contract by which a person, the employee, undertakes, for a limited time and for remuneration, to do work under the direction or control of another person, the employer.\n[8] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019article 2098 d\u00e9finit un contrat d\u2019entreprise ou de service comme suit :\nCHAPITRE HUITI\u00c8ME\nDU CONTRAT D\u2019ENTREPRISE OU DE SERVICE\nSECTION I\nDE LA NATURE ET DE L\u2019\u00c9TENDUE DU CONTRAT\nArt. 2098. Le contrat d\u2019entreprise ou de service est celui par lequel une personne, selon le cas l\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services, s\u2019engage envers une autre personne, le client, \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un ouvrage mat\u00e9riel ou intellectuel ou \u00e0 fournir un service moyennant un prix que le client s\u2019oblige \u0430 lui payer.\nArt. 2099. L\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services a le libre choix des moyens d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat et il n\u2019existe entre lui et le client aucun lien de subordination quant \u00e0 son ex\u00e9cution.\nCHAPTER VIII\nCONTRACT OF ENTERPRISE OR FOR SERVICES\nSECTION I\nNATURE AND SCOPE OF THE CONTRACT\nArt. 2098. A contract of enterprise or for services is a contract by which a person, the contractor or the provider of services, as the case may be, undertakes to carry out physical or intellectual work for another person, the client or to provide a service, for a price which the client binds himself to pay.\nArt. 2099. The contractor or the provider of services is free to choose the means of performing the contract and no relationship of subordination exists between the contractor or the provider of services and the client in respect of such performance.\nArt. 2098. Le contrat d\u2019entreprise ou de service est celui par lequel une personne, selon le cas l\u2019entrepreneur ou le prestataire de services, s\u2019engage envers une autre personne, le client, \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un ouvrage mat\u00e9riel ou intellectuel ou \u00e0 fournir un service moyennant un prix que le client s\u2019oblige \u0430 lui payer.\n[9] L\u2019article 1425 s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat et pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nArt. 1425. Dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, on doit rechercher quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la commune intention des parties plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019arr\u00eater au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes utilis\u00e9s.\nArt. 1425. The common intention of the parties rather than adherence to the literal meaning of the words shall be sought in interpreting a contract.\n[10] J\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans les d\u00e9cisions Romanza soins capillaires et corporels inc. c. M.R.N., 2015 CCI 328 (et Hendricks c. La Reine, 2008 CCI 497) que le droit applicable dans des affaires comme celle-ci est le suivant :\n[23] Il ressort de plusieurs arr\u00eats de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et notamment de l\u2019arr\u00eat Le Livreur Plus inc. c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), 2004 CAF 68, que les lignes directrices ou les crit\u00e8res traditionnels de la common law mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.R.N, 1986 CanLII 6775 (CAF), [1986] 3 C.F. 553, 87 DTC 5025, sont des points de rep\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe entre les parties un lien de subordination qui est caract\u00e9ristique d\u2019un contrat de travail ou s\u2019il existe plut\u00f4t un degr\u00e9 d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance qui indique l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat d\u2019entreprise aux termes du Code civil. De plus, l\u2019intention mutuelle ou la stipulation des parties quant \u00e0 la nature de leurs relations contractuelles doivent \u00eatre prises en consid\u00e9ration et peuvent \u00eatre un instrument utile d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la nature du contrat aux fins de sa qualification en vertu du Code civil. Voir, par exemple, les arr\u00eats de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les affaires D & J Driveway Inc. c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), 2003 CAF 453, et Grimard c. Canada, 2009 CAF 47, [2009] 4 R.C.F. 592, lesquels enseignent que l\u2019intention des parties constitue un facteur important \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour qualifier un contrat en vertu du Code civil. Les observations formul\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet de l\u2019intention des parties dans ces arr\u00eats ayant trait au Qu\u00e9bec sont conformes \u00e0 ses observations plus r\u00e9centes formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019importance de l\u2019intention en common law dans l\u2019arr\u00eat 1392644 Ontario Inc. (Connor Homes) c. Canada (M.R.N.), 2013 CAF 85.\n[24] Les lignes directrices ou crit\u00e8res traditionnels de la common law relatifs au contrat de louage de services ou au contrat de travail par opposition \u00e0 un contrat d\u2019entreprise ou d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant sont bien \u00e9tablis. On \u00e9tablit l\u2019emploi assurable en recherchant si l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 exploite vraiment une entreprise \u00e0 son compte. Voir les d\u00e9cisions Market Investigations, Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security, [1968] 3 All E.R. 732 (Q.B.D.), 671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 CSC 59, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 983, et Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.R.N., 1986 CanLII 6775 (CAF), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\n[25] Pour trancher la question, il faut tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pertinentes ainsi que d\u2019un certain nombre de crit\u00e8res ou de lignes directrices utiles, notamment : 1) l\u2019intention des parties; 2) le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 sur les activit\u00e9s; 3) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des instruments de travail; 4) la possibilit\u00e9 de profit ou le risque de perte. Il n\u2019existe aucune mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9\u00e9tablie d\u2019appliquer les facteurs pertinents; leur importance relative et leur pertinence d\u00e9pendent des faits et des circonstances propres \u00e0 chaque affaire.\n[26] Aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 46 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Grimard, et en particulier au paragraphe 43, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale expose en d\u00e9tail les diff\u00e9rences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi assurable, pour les besoins de l\u2019assurance\u2011emploi, entre le droit civil et la common law :\n33 Pour importante qu\u2019elle soit, l\u2019intention des parties n\u2019est pas \u00e0 elle seule d\u00e9terminante de la qualification du contrat : voir D&J Driveway Inc. c. M.R.N., 2003 CAF 453; Dynamex Canada Inc. c. Mamona, 2003 CAF 248. De fait, le comportement des parties dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat doit refl\u00e9ter et actualiser cette intention commune, sinon la qualification du contrat se fera en fonction de ce que r\u00e9v\u00e8le la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 factuelle et non de ce que pr\u00e9tendent les parties.\n[\u2026]\n36 Dans l\u2019affaire Wolf c. Canada, 2002 CAF 96 (CanLII), [2002] 4 C.F. 396, notre coll\u00e8gue, le juge D\u00e9cary, citait l\u2019extrait suivant de feu Robert P. Gagnon tir\u00e9 de son volume Le droit du travail au Qu\u00e9bec, 5e \u00e9d., Cowansville : Yvon Blais, 2003, aux pages 66 et 67 et pr\u00e9cisant le contenu de la notion de subordination en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois :\nHistoriquement, le droit civil a d\u2019abord \u00e9labor\u00e9 une notion de subordination juridique dite stricte ou classique qui a servi de crit\u00e8re d\u2019application du principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile du commettant pour le dommage caus\u00e9 par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions (art. 1054 C.c.B.\u2011C.; art. 1463 C.c.Q). Cette subordination juridique classique \u00e9tait caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par le contr\u00f4le imm\u00e9diat exerc\u00e9 par l\u2019employeur sur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail de l\u2019employ\u00e9 quant \u00e0 sa nature et \u00e0 ses modalit\u00e9s. Elle s\u2019est progressivement assouplie pour donner naissance \u00e0 la notion de subordination juridique au sens large. La diversification et la sp\u00e9cialisation des occupations et des techniques de travail ont, en effet, rendu souvent irr\u00e9aliste que l\u2019employeur soit en mesure de dicter ou m\u00eame de surveiller de fa\u00e7on imm\u00e9diate l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail. On en est ainsi venu \u00e0 assimiler la subordination \u00e0 la facult\u00e9, laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qu\u2019on reconna\u00eetra alors comme l\u2019employeur, de d\u00e9terminer le travail \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter, d\u2019encadrer cette ex\u00e9cution et de la contr\u00f4ler. En renversant la perspective, le salari\u00e9 sera celui qui accepte de s\u2019int\u00e9grer dans le cadre de fonctionnement d\u2019une entreprise pour la faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son travail. En pratique, on recherchera la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019indices d\u2019encadrement, d\u2019ailleurs susceptibles de varier selon les contextes : pr\u00e9sence obligatoire \u00e0 un lieu de travail, assignation plus ou moins r\u00e9guli\u00e8re du travail, imposition de r\u00e8gles de conduite ou de comportement, exigence de rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9, contr\u00f4le de la quantit\u00e9 ou de la qualit\u00e9 de la prestation, etc. Le travail \u00e0 domicile n\u2019exclut pas une telle int\u00e9gration \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise.\n37 On retrouve dans cet extrait la notion de contr\u00f4le sur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail aussi pr\u00e9sente dans les crit\u00e8res de la common law, \u00e0 cette diff\u00e9rence que la notion de contr\u00f4le est, en vertu du droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, plus qu\u2019un simple crit\u00e8re comme en common law. Elle est une caract\u00e9ristique essentielle du contrat de travail : voir D&J Driveway, au paragraphe 16 de cette d\u00e9cision; et 9041\u20116868 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. c. M.R.N., 2005 CAF 334.\n38 Mais on peut \u00e9galement noter dans l\u2019extrait de Me Gagnon que le concept juridique de subordination ou contr\u00f4le, pour que l\u2019on puisse conclure \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sence dans une relation de travail, fait aussi appel en pratique \u00e0 ce que l\u2019auteur appelle des indices d\u2019encadrement, que notre Cour a qualifi\u00e9s de points de rep\u00e8re dans l\u2019affaire Livreur Plus Inc. c. M.R.N., 2004 CAF 68, au paragraphe 18; et dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Charbonneau, [1996] A.C.F. no 1337 (C.A.) (QL), au paragraphe 3.\n39 Par exemple, l\u2019int\u00e9gration du travailleur dans l\u2019entreprise appara\u00eet en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois comme un indice d\u2019encadrement qu\u2019il importe ou qu\u2019il est utile de rechercher en pratique pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de subordination juridique. N\u2019est\u2011ce pas l\u00e0 \u00e9galement un crit\u00e8re ou un facteur recherch\u00e9 en common law pour d\u00e9finir la nature juridique de la relation de travail existante?\n40 De m\u00eame, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, un employeur, et non l\u2019employ\u00e9, encaisse les profits et subit les pertes de l\u2019entreprise. En outre, l\u2019employeur est responsable des faits et gestes de son employ\u00e9. Ne sont\u2011ce pas l\u00e0 des indices pratiques d\u2019encadrement, r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs d\u2019une subordination juridique aussi bien en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qu\u2019en common law?\n41 Enfin, le crit\u00e8re de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des instruments de travail, mis de l\u2019avant par la common law, n\u2019est\u2011il pas aussi un indice d\u2019encadrement qu\u2019il convient d\u2019examiner? Car, selon les circonstances, il peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une int\u00e9gration du travailleur \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise et son assujettissement ou sa d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 celle\u2011ci. Il peut contribuer \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de subordination juridique. Plus souvent qu\u2019autrement dans un contrat de travail, l\u2019employeur fournit \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 les instruments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son travail. Par contre, il m\u2019appara\u00eet beaucoup plus difficile de conclure \u00e0 une int\u00e9gration dans l\u2019entreprise lorsque la personne qui ex\u00e9cute le travail poss\u00e8de son propre camion, par exemple, arborant de la publicit\u00e9 \u00e0 son nom et quelque 200 000 $ d\u2019outils pour accomplir les fonctions qu\u2019il exerce et qu\u2019il commercialise.\n42 Il va de soi, aussi bien en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qu\u2019en common law, que ces indices d\u2019encadrement (crit\u00e8res ou points de rep\u00e8re), lorsque chacun est pris isol\u00e9ment, ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9terminants. Ainsi, par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Vulcain Alarme Inc. c. Canada M.R.N., [1999] A.C.F. No 749 (C.A.) (QL), le fait que l\u2019entrepreneur devait se servir d\u2019un co\u00fbteux appareil sp\u00e9cial de d\u00e9tection fourni par le donneur d\u2019ouvrage pour v\u00e9rifier et calibrer des d\u00e9tecteurs de substances toxiques ne fut pas jug\u00e9 suffisant en soi pour transformer ce qui \u00e9tait un contrat d\u2019entreprise en un contrat de travail.\n43 En somme, il n\u2019y a pas, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u2019antinomie entre les principes du droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et les soi\u2011disant crit\u00e8res de common law utilis\u00e9s pour qualifier la nature juridique de la relation de travail entre deux parties. Dans la recherche d\u2019un lien de subordination juridique, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire de ce contr\u00f4le du travail, exig\u00e9 par le droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec pour l\u2019existence d\u2019un contrat de travail, aucune erreur ne r\u00e9sulte du fait que le tribunal prenne en compte, comme indices d\u2019encadrement, les autres crit\u00e8res mis de l\u2019avant par la common law, soit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des outils, l\u2019expectative de profits et les risques de pertes, ainsi que l\u2019int\u00e9gration dans l\u2019entreprise.\n[27] De m\u00eame, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e sur la question, aux paragraphes 18 \u00e0 20 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Le Livreur Plus Inc. :\n18 Dans ce contexte, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door Services Ltd. c. M.R.N., 1986 CanLII 6775 (CAF) 87 D.T.C. 5025, \u00e0 savoir le degr\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des instruments de travail, les chances de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et les risques de pertes et enfin l\u2019int\u00e9gration, ne sont que des points de rep\u00e8re : Charbonneau c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national \u2013 M.R.N.) (1996), 207 N.R. 299, paragraphe 3. En pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable contrat, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si, entre les parties, existe un lien de subordination, caract\u00e9ristique du contrat de travail, ou s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas, plut\u00f4t, un degr\u00e9 d\u2019autonomie r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019un contrat d\u2019entreprise : ibidem.\n19 Ceci dit, il ne faut pas, au plan du contr\u00f4le, confondre le contr\u00f4le du r\u00e9sultat ou de la qualit\u00e9 des travaux avec le contr\u00f4le de leur ex\u00e9cution par l\u2019ouvrier charg\u00e9 de les r\u00e9aliser : Vulcain Alarme Inc. c. Le ministre du Revenu national, A\u2011376\u201198, 11 mai 1999, paragraphe 10, (C.A.F.); D & J Driveway Inc. c. Le ministre du Revenu national, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 9. Comme le disait notre coll\u00e8gue le juge D\u00e9cary dans l\u2019affaire Charbonneau c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national - M.R.N), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, suivie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jaillet c. Canada (ministre du Revenu national \u2013 M.R.N.), 2002 CAF 394, \u00ab rares sont les donneurs d\u2019ouvrage qui ne s\u2019assurent pas que le travail est ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 avec leurs exigences et aux lieux convenus. Le contr\u00f4le du r\u00e9sultat ne doit pas \u00eatre confondu avec le contr\u00f4le du travailleur \u00bb.\n20 Je suis d\u2019accord avec les pr\u00e9tentions de la demanderesse. Un sous\u2011entrepreneur n\u2019est pas une personne libre de toute contrainte qui travaille \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, selon ses inclinations et sans la moindre pr\u00e9occupation pour ses coll\u00e8gues co\u2011contractants et les tiers. Ce n\u2019est pas un dilettante \u00e0 l\u2019attitude cavali\u00e8re, voire irrespectueuse, capricieuse ou irresponsable. Il \u0153uvre dans un cadre d\u00e9fini, mais il le fait avec autonomie et \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de celui de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le contrat de sous\u2011traitance rev\u00eat souvent un caract\u00e8re l\u00e9onin dict\u00e9 par les obligations de l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : il est \u00e0 prendre ou \u00e0 laisser. Mais sa nature n\u2019en est pas alt\u00e9r\u00e9e pour autant. Et l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne perd pas son droit de regard sur le r\u00e9sultat et la qualit\u00e9 des travaux puisqu\u2019il en assume la seule et enti\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9 vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis ses clients.\n[28] De plus, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait les observations suivantes dans l\u2019arr\u00eat D & J Driveway Inc. :\n2 Nous reconnaissons d\u2019embl\u00e9e que la stipulation des parties quant \u00e0 la nature de leurs relations contractuelles n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9terminante et que la cour charg\u00e9e d\u2019examiner cette question peut en arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9termination contraire sur la foi de la preuve qui lui est soumise : Dynamex Canada inc. c. Canada, 2003 CAF 248 (CanLII) [2003] 305 N.R. 295 (C.A.F.). Mais cette stipulation ou l\u2019interrogatoire des parties sur la question peuvent s\u2019av\u00e9rer un instrument utile d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la nature du contrat intervenu entre les participants.\n[29] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat D & J Driveway Inc., la Cour d\u2019appel a ensuite reconnu, au paragraphe 4, qu\u2019il est possible de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Wiebe Door Services pour appr\u00e9cier l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de subordination au titre du Code civil.\n[11] Il convient de noter que la d\u00e9finition d\u2019emploi assurable dans la Loi n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9e aux personnes qui gagnent un salaire \u00e0 l\u2019heure, \u00e0 la semaine, au mois ou \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique express\u00e9ment \u00ab que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soit calcul\u00e9e soit au temps ou aux pi\u00e8ces, soit en partie au temps et en partie aux pi\u00e8ces, soit de toute autre mani\u00e8re \u00bb. Cette d\u00e9finition est importante parce que, comme nous le verrons plus loin, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Ubartas provenant du GFP \u00e9tait fonction de la quantit\u00e9 de bois qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les secteurs qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s par le GFP.\n[12] Le Tribunal administratif du travail du Qu\u00e9bec (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) a tenu une audience sur la question de savoir si M. Ubartas \u00e9tait ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas engag\u00e9 par le GFP en vertu d\u2019un contrat de louage de services en 2020 et 2021. Il s\u2019agit en substance de la m\u00eame question de fond concernant un contrat de louage de services par rapport \u00e0 un contrat d\u2019entreprise. Le Tribunal a tenu compte des m\u00eames ann\u00e9es et s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur la plupart des m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 2023 que M. Ubartas travaillait aux termes d\u2019un contrat de louage de services avec son employeur, le GFP. Il convient de souligner que le Tribunal est arriv\u00e9 en gros \u00e0 la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision que celle que j\u2019indique ci\u2011dessous pour essentiellement les m\u00eames motifs. Cela dit, le Tribunal est un tribunal administratif et non une cour de justice et, par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas li\u00e9 par cette d\u00e9cision en vertu de la doctrine du stare decisis ou de la courtoisie judiciaire.\nIV. Intention des parties\n[13] M. Ubartas a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour le GFP en 2015. M. Ubartas maintient cette position, et le GFP n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9saccord. J\u2019estime que les deux parties voulaient que leur relation soit une relation d\u2019emploi et elles l\u2019ont trait\u00e9e comme tel. Le GFP a vers\u00e9 des retenues salariales pendant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 M. Ubartas travaillait pour lui, lui a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 des feuillets T4, lui a vers\u00e9 des indemnit\u00e9s de vacances, a pay\u00e9 ses cong\u00e9s de maladie et l\u2019a pay\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il ne pouvait pas travailler parce que l\u2019\u00e9quipement \u00e9tait en panne, qu\u2019il pleuvait et parce qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9 au travail. Cela s\u2019est poursuivi au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2020\u20112021 en question.\n[14] Selon le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du GFP, il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es, aux environs de la p\u00e9riode en question, le GFP a converti en entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants tous ses employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient abatteurs manuels. Toutefois, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le GFP aurait offert aux abatteurs de continuer \u00e0 leur fournir des services de paie comprenant des retenues d\u2019imp\u00f4t comme s\u2019ils \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s. Le GFP devait faire une telle offre pour conserver un nombre suffisant d\u2019abatteurs dans ses rangs. Certains abatteurs ont accept\u00e9 cette option, et M. Ubartas a d\u00fb \u00eatre l\u2019un d\u2019eux. Le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas encore ses fonctions aupr\u00e8s de GFP \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et qu\u2019il ne sait pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert aux abatteurs. Il comprend maintenant que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019a fait le GFP. J\u2019estime que cette explication n\u2019est ni fiable, ni cr\u00e9dible, ni \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve. Comme je le d\u00e9cris plus loin, le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant et l\u2019ensemble de la preuve montrent clairement que rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9 pour ces abatteurs \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Je conclus que, si une telle chose s\u2019est produite dans le cas de l\u2019emploi des abatteurs \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, c\u2019est qu\u2019on leur a offert la possibilit\u00e9 de devenir des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants s\u2019ils le voulaient, et je conclus que M. Ubartas et au moins quelques autres n\u2019ont pas fait ce choix. Compte tenu de ces conclusions, M. Ubartas et le GFP avaient l\u2019intention de conserver leur relation employeur-employ\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode en question.\n[15] M. Ubartas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019intention mutuelle \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019a chang\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son accident de travail de septembre 2021, lorsque le GFP l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant. M. Ubartas n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9 au travail apr\u00e8s cet accident. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Ubartas compte tenu du peu de fiabilit\u00e9 de la version du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, y compris le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de ou\u00ef-dire. Je souligne \u00e9galement que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Ubartas concorde avec le fait que le GFP a contest\u00e9 son statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019instance devant le tribunal provincial, qui est le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve documentaire produit par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties qui ne cadre pas avec la th\u00e8se que M. Ubartas \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 du GFP.\nV. Subordination et contr\u00f4le\n[16] Le contrema\u00eetre du GFP donnait \u00e0 M. Ubartas des instructions sur les zones qu\u2019il devait r\u00e9colter et sur la question de savoir s\u2019il devait effectuer une coupe compl\u00e8te ou partielle. C\u2019est le GFP qui obtenait les droits et les contrats de coupe, et c\u2019est le GFP qui \u00e9tablissait le prix du bois d\u2019\u0153uvre avec ses clients.\n[17] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais refus\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer le travail qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9. Il travaillait 8,5 heures par jour du lundi au vendredi pendant la saison annuelle de neuf \u00e0 dix mois.\n[18] Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que M. Ubartas pouvait donner son travail en sous-traitance ou confier son travail \u00e0 un rempla\u00e7ant. Rien dans la preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019il pouvait embaucher un assistant pour accomplir quelque aspect que ce soit de son travail avec lui. M. Ubartas n\u2019a jamais travaill\u00e9 pour quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode, il n\u2019a travaill\u00e9 que pour le GFP.\n[19] Alors que M. Ubartas \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de faire une coupe compl\u00e8te ou partielle du bois dans les secteurs assign\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux directives re\u00e7ues, le contrema\u00eetre donnait des instructions sur l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 conduire sa d\u00e9busqueuse dans les secteurs qui lui \u00e9taient assign\u00e9s et sur la fa\u00e7on de g\u00e9rer les eaux us\u00e9es etc., c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le GFP l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 suivre ses directives sur les meilleures pratiques d\u2019exploitation foresti\u00e8re et d\u2019autres pratiques foresti\u00e8res, y compris quant au moment et \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le bois du secteur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9colt\u00e9.\n[20] Ind\u00e9pendamment de son travail d\u2019abattage, lorsque de nouveaux sentiers et de nouvelles routes devaient \u00eatre am\u00e9nag\u00e9s, M. Ubartas \u00e9tait inform\u00e9 de leur trac\u00e9 et du moment o\u00f9 ils devaient \u00eatre construits.\n[21] Le contrema\u00eetre se pr\u00e9sentait au moins une fois par semaine et parfois plusieurs fois par semaine, en fonction de la vaste exp\u00e9rience de M. Ubartas comme homme de m\u00e9tier dans cette t\u00e2che, et ce domaine en particulier. Le contrema\u00eetre v\u00e9rifiait que le bois avait \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9 \u00e0 la bonne longueur et conform\u00e9ment aux autres normes de l\u2019industrie foresti\u00e8re.\n[22] M. Ubartas devait informer le GFP de sa pr\u00e9sence sur le chantier, de son d\u00e9part du chantier, de ses absences pour cause de maladie ou de ses demandes de cong\u00e9 pour se rendre \u00e0 un rendez-vous, ainsi que des pannes de sa d\u00e9busqueuse. Le GFP faisait le suivi de ces heures. M. Ubartas devait \u00e9galement rendre compte au GFP de l\u2019utilisation de ses jours de cong\u00e9.\n[23] Les facteurs de la subordination et du contr\u00f4le font pencher la balance fortement en faveur de la th\u00e8se de l\u2019emploi et non celle du statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nVI. Possibilit\u00e9s de profit et risques de perte\n[24] M. Ubartas recevait un salaire hebdomadaire de 800 $. Toutes les retenues appropri\u00e9es \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es aux fins f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales. Aucune TPS n\u2019\u00e9tait factur\u00e9e ni pay\u00e9e par le GFP lorsqu\u2019il versait \u00e0 M. Ubartas son salaire.\n[25] Le salaire de M. Ubartas \u00e9tait vers\u00e9 sous forme d\u2019avances hebdomadaires de 800 $ et faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019un rapprochement des comptes \u00e0 la fin de la saison sur la base du volume final de bois coup\u00e9 et livr\u00e9 au bord de la route[1]. Il n\u2019est pas clair s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un emploi \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce assorti d\u2019avances ou d\u2019un salaire major\u00e9 d\u2019une prime de rendement pour les employ\u00e9s. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, tous les montants, sauf les paiements de location de la d\u00e9busqueuse de 1000 $ par semaine, constituaient un revenu suppl\u00e9mentaire provenant du travail de M. Ubartas. Cela avait pour but de les encourager, lui et les autres abatteurs, \u00e0 \u00eatre plus efficaces.\n[26] Bien qu\u2019il puisse augmenter sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration horaire de cette fa\u00e7on, il ne pouvait couper que du bois provenant des secteurs qui lui \u00e9taient assign\u00e9s et il n\u2019avait aucun contr\u00f4le sur les contrats de bois acquis par le GFP ou sur les secteurs qui lui \u00e9taient assign\u00e9s par le GFP, ni sur la d\u00e9cision d\u2019effectuer une coupe compl\u00e8te ou partielle.\n[27] M. Ubartas a \u00e9galement effectu\u00e9 de nombreux autres travaux pour le GFP r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s sur la base d\u2019un salaire horaire, comme le tra\u00e7age de sentiers et de chemins, entre autres, pendant les ann\u00e9es en question.\n[28] M. Ubartas recevait \u00e9galement un montant fixe de 1 000 $ par semaine pendant toute la saison pour l\u2019utilisation de sa d\u00e9busqueuse. Cette somme \u00e9tait vers\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Ubartas[2].\n[29] Ces facteurs financiers font fortement pencher la balance en faveur de l\u2019emploi et non du statut d\u2019entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant.\nVII. Outils, fournitures, conformit\u00e9 r\u00e9glementaire\n[30] Le GFP a fourni toute la formation r\u00e9glementaire ainsi que la formation sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 requises par la loi ou par ses pratiques foresti\u00e8res et ses politiques de conformit\u00e9. M. Ubartas a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les modules de formation annuels du GFP.\n[31] M. Ubartas a \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 par le GFP pour tout l\u2019achat de tout le mat\u00e9riel de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, y compris un GPS portatif, un casque de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, des lunettes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, des bottes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, des gants de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des accessoires de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour sa scie \u00e0 cha\u00eene.\n[32] La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. Ubartas \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la d\u00e9busqueuse qu\u2019il utilisait au travail. Le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a confirm\u00e9 que le GFP ne poss\u00e9dait pas de d\u00e9busqueuses, qu\u2019elles appartenaient toutes \u00e0 leurs abatteurs, m\u00eame lorsque ces derniers \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s. Ce n\u2019est pas toujours le cas dans l\u2019industrie. Cependant, M. Ubartas a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une d\u00e9busqueuse lorsqu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 pour Abitibi Bowater pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es et qu\u2019il accomplissait la m\u00eame t\u00e2che. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a utilis\u00e9 sa d\u00e9busqueuse que pour son travail au sein du GFP.\n[33] Ce facteur fait pencher quelque peu la balance en faveur du statut d\u2019employ\u00e9.\nVIII. Autres facteurs\n[34] Apr\u00e8s 2019, M. Ubartas a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 la f\u00eate de No\u00ebl du personnel du GFP, etc. M. Ubartas a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 par \u00e9crit \u00e0 cotiser au REER collectif du GFP dans une lettre indiquant que la cotisation r\u00e9duirait ses retenues d\u2019employ\u00e9. Ces facteurs font \u00e9galement pencher la balance en faveur du statut d\u2019employ\u00e9.\nIX. Conclusion\n[35] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration et soupes\u00e9 les facteurs applicables, je conclus que M. Ubartas occupait un emploi assurable au sein du GFP en 2020 et en 2021.\n[36] Je reconnais que le GFP a pu r\u00e9organiser sa main-d\u2019\u0153uvre d\u2019abatteurs, lesquels sont pass\u00e9s du statut d\u2019employ\u00e9s au statut d\u2019entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants, puisque le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait cru comprendre, d\u2019apr\u00e8s d\u2019autres personnes, que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il est clair qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9 ou adopt\u00e9 pour tenir compte d\u2019une telle r\u00e9organisation. En fait, aucun changement important n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9. Le GFP d\u00e9livrait syst\u00e9matiquement des feuillets T4 chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Ubartas, indiquant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait son employ\u00e9 et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait assujetti aux retenues salariales. Leurs dossiers en t\u00e9moignent, tout comme leurs d\u00e9clarations de revenus.\nSign\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, Canada, ce 10e jour de juin 2024.\n\u00ab Patrick Boyle \u00bb\nJuge Boyle\nR\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE :\n2024 CCI 85\nNO DU DOSSIER DE LA COUR :\n2023-344(EI)\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nVICTOR UBARTAS ET M.R.N.\nLIEU DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nTrois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec)\nDATE DE L\u2019AUDIENCE :\nLe 26 avril 2024\nMOTIFS DU JUGEMENT :\nL\u2019honorable juge Patrick Boyle\nDATE DU JUGEMENT :\nLe 10 juin 2024\nCOMPARUTIONS :\nAvocate de l\u2019appelant :\nMe Gaby G\u00e9linas\nAvocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe Samantha Jackmino\nAVOCAT INSCRIT AU DOSSIER :\nPour l\u2019appelant :\nNom :\nMe Gaby G\u00e9linas\nCabinet :\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nMe Shalene Curtis-Micallef Sous-procureure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Canada Ottawa, Canada\n[1] Il n\u2019est pas clair si M.

Pr\u00e9ambule\n[1] Monsieur Andrzej Barwicz, l\u2019appelant, interjette appel d'une cotisation \u00e9tablie en vertu de l\u2019article 160 de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu [1] en date du 15 septembre 2016 (Cotisation). La cotisation le tient solidairement responsable de la dette fiscale d\u2019une fiducie, Zaba Trust (Fiducie), aupr\u00e8s de la ministre du Revenu national (Ministre) au montant de 1 602 233,35$. Cette dette fiscale de la Fiducie fait suite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019une cotisation de la Ministre \u00e9mise par avis en date du 10 juin 2009 relativement \u00e0 son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 (Cotisation sous-jacente).\n[2] Dans le cadre de l\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant soul\u00e8ve des moyens d\u2019appel autant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Cotisation que de la Cotisation sous-jacente.\nII. Contexte\n[3] Cette affaire soul\u00e8ve principalement des questions de droit. Les faits pertinents au litige ne sont pas contest\u00e9s et ne sont pas au c\u0153ur du litige qui persiste entre les parties. Les paragraphes qui suivent sont un bref survol des faits, en notant que l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits (partiel) d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par les parties est reproduit en annexe aux pr\u00e9sents motifs (Annexe A).\n[4] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la Fiducie est constitu\u00e9e en Ontario par la conjointe de l\u2019appelant. Royal Trust Corporation of Canada est nomm\u00e9e seule fiduciaire, alors que monsieur Wieslaw Barwicz, le fr\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant, est nomm\u00e9 protecteur. L\u2019appelant est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 l\u2019un des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la Fiducie. Au total, neuf b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s express\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe A de l\u2019acte de fiducie [2].\n[5] L\u2019acte de fiducie stipule que l\u2019ensemble des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires nomm\u00e9s poss\u00e8dent les m\u00eames droits quant au patrimoine de la Fiducie. L\u2019acte de fiducie ne stipule aucune distinction entre les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du revenu ou du capital de la Fiducie, l\u2019ensemble des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires pouvant recevoir quelques distributions que ce soit \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du fiduciaire. \u00c0 sa cr\u00e9ation, la Fiducie est r\u00e9sidente du Canada aux fins de la LIR.\n[6] \u00c9galement, en vertu de l\u2019acte de fiducie, le fiduciaire d\u00e9tient un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour attribuer le revenu et le capital de la Fiducie au ou aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire(s) de son choix. Aucun droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire dans la Fiducie n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis pour une contrepartie payable \u00e0 la Fiducie ou \u00e0 toute personne qui a fait un apport \u00e0 la Fiducie.\n[7] Toujours le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la Fiducie acquiert 1 225 932 actions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bookham Exchange Inc. (Bookham) de la Fiducie Familiale Barwicz, qui en \u00e9tait jusque-l\u00e0 d\u00e9tentrice.\n[8] Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001, Royal Bank of Canada Financial Corporation remplace Royal Trust Corporation of Canada au titre de l\u2019unique fiduciaire de la Fiducie. Le fiduciaire est, aux fins fiscales, un r\u00e9sident de la Barbade. Les parties conviennent que la Fiducie, \u00e0 compter du changement de fiduciaire, a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider au Canada aux fins de la LIR et est r\u00e9sidente de la Barbade aux fins de la Convention fiscale Canada-Barbade. La Fiducie demeurera r\u00e9sidente de la Barbade jusqu\u2019au moment de sa liquidation.\n[9] Le 3 avril 2002, le fiduciaire de la Fiducie produit au Canada une d\u00e9claration de revenus T3 pour son ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001, laquelle fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une cotisation initiale en date du 27 d\u00e9cembre 2002. Dans le cadre d\u2019une v\u00e9rification fiscale ult\u00e9rieure de la Fiducie, ayant suivi la liquidation de la Fiducie, la Ministre \u00e9tablit la Cotisation sous-jacente couvrant une premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie. La Fiducie s\u2019oppose et en appelle de la Cotisation sous-jacente, pour ensuite se d\u00e9sister de son appel devant la Cour.\n[10] En 2003, la Fiducie r\u00e9alise des op\u00e9rations relativement aux actions de Bookham. Ces op\u00e9rations permettent \u00e0 la Fiducie de d\u00e9gager des liquidit\u00e9s. Le fiduciaire confirme par voie de r\u00e9solution \u00e9crite sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une distribution de capital de la Fiducie en faveur exclusive de l\u2019appelant. Ainsi, par r\u00e9solution \u00e9crite en date de la distribution, le fiduciaire distribue \u00e0 l\u2019appelant une premi\u00e8re fois le 8 janvier 2004 une distribution de capital au montant de 2 250 000$. Une seconde r\u00e9solution sera adopt\u00e9e par le fiduciaire pr\u00e9voyant une distribution de capital cette fois le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2005 au montant de 830 288$. Cette distribution constitue la derni\u00e8re distribution par le fiduciaire. La Fiducie sera par la suite liquid\u00e9e et termin\u00e9e.\n[11] En date du dernier transfert, selon la position de la Ministre, la dette fiscale de la Fiducie s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve alors \u00e0 1 602 233,35$. C\u2019est cette somme que l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9clame \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en vertu de l\u2019article 160 LIR.\nIII. Questions en litige\n[12] Les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont ultimement de deux ordres. Une premi\u00e8re question concerne la d\u00e9termination de la fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e de la Fiducie aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir la Cotisation sous-jacente. La seconde concerne la cotisation de l\u2019appelant aux fins du paragraphe 160(1) LIR. Ces deux questions peuvent se pr\u00e9senter comme suit :\nle changement de r\u00e9sidence fiscale de la Fiducie survenu le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 a-t-il entrain\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement avant la cessation de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 pareille date l\u2019application du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR produisant aux fins de la LIR une fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e de la Fiducie ainsi qu\u2019une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e des biens appartenant \u00e0 la Fiducie?\nla Fiducie a-t-elle re\u00e7u de l\u2019appelant, et par le fait m\u00eame l\u2019appelant a t-il donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Fiducie, une contrepartie se qualifiant comme telle aux fins du sous-alin\u00e9a 160(1)e)(i) LIR au moment o\u00f9 elle lui a distribu\u00e9 les fonds d\u00e9crits pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, et si oui, quelle est la valeur de cette contrepartie?\n[13] Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre question en litige entre les parties. Entre autres, les sommes impliqu\u00e9es, le traitement qui r\u00e9sulte de la Cotisation sous-jacente et la cessation de r\u00e9sidence au Canada de la Fiducie provoqu\u00e9e par le changement de son fiduciaire ne sont pas \u00e0 proprement parler en litige.\nIV. Position des parties\n[14] Sur la premi\u00e8re question, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que les motifs sur lesquels repose la Cotisation sous-jacente sont bien-fond\u00e9s en fait et en droit. La date de la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition 2001 de la Fiducie comme \u00e9tabli aux fins de la Cotisation sous-jacente se fonde sur le changement de r\u00e9sidence fiscale qu\u2019a provoqu\u00e9 le changement de fiduciaire de la Fiducie survenu \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001. \u00c0 ce moment, la Fiducie a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider au Canada aux fins de la LIR.\n[15] Toujours selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 la Fiducie \u00e9migre \u00e0 la Barbade, elle enclenche le m\u00e9canisme du paragraphe 128.1(4) de la LIR. En vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a)(i), l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie aux fins de la LIR est r\u00e9put\u00e9e s\u2019\u00eatre termin\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement avant le moment o\u00f9 la Fiducie a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider au Canada, et une nouvelle ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition est r\u00e9put\u00e9e commenc\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 la Fiducie cesse de r\u00e9sider au Canada. \u00c9galement, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)b), la Fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble de ses biens, constitu\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement d\u2019actions de Bookham, imm\u00e9diatement avant la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e et avoir re\u00e7u en contrepartie la juste valeur marchande des actions \u00e0 ce moment. Finalement, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)c), la Fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir r\u00e9acquis au m\u00eame prix l\u2019ensemble de ses biens.\n[16] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la version du paragraphe 94(1) LIR applicable \u00e0 l\u2019appel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019une fois les cons\u00e9quences du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR consomm\u00e9es, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de la Fiducie qui d\u00e9bute une fois l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition provoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9migration de la Fiducie est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e se terminer. Ainsi, l\u2019existence du paragraphe 94(1) n\u2019emp\u00eache pas ou n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur les cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019entrainent le paragraphe 128.1(4).\n[17] Sur la deuxi\u00e8me question qui vise la cotisation \u00e9mise en vertu de l\u2019article 160 LIR, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que la Fiducie n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune contrepartie en \u00e9change de la distribution des sommes \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Cons\u00e9quemment, la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie est nulle, et la responsabilit\u00e9 fiscale de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 160 LIR correspond au moindre de la dette fiscale au moment des transferts et du total des transferts. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est la dette fiscale de la Fiducie au moment des transferts qui est la moindre.\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 rejette par ailleurs la position de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle le paragraphe 107(2) LIR a une quelconque influence sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 160 LIR. Selon lui, le traitement fiscal de cette transaction pour la Fiducie n\u2019a pas d\u2019impact sur la question \u00e0 savoir si une contrepartie a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e ou non.\n[19] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019appelant, il avance sur la premi\u00e8re question en litige que la Ministre fait une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation des interactions entre les paragraphes 94(1) et 128.1(4) LIR. Selon lui, la version applicable du sous-alin\u00e9a 94(1)c)(i) a pour effet de cr\u00e9er une pr\u00e9somption [3] que la Fiducie r\u00e9side au Canada tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour les fins de la partie I de la LIR. En d\u2019autres mots, il interpr\u00e8te le mot \u00ab ann\u00e9e \u00bb comme signifiant ann\u00e9e civile, de sorte que la Fiducie serait, en vertu de cet article, r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pour toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2001.\n[20] Ainsi, m\u00eame si le statut de r\u00e9sidence de la Fiducie a chang\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 aux fins de la LIR et de la convention fiscale applicable, le statut de r\u00e9sidence serait r\u00e9put\u00e9 ne pas changer pour les fins de la partie I en vertu du paragraphe 94(1) LIR. Le paragraphe 94(1) \u00e9tablit un r\u00e9gime qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la Fiducie sans \u00e9gard au paragraphe 128.1(4) et en cons\u00e9quence la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie se poursuit jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001 au-del\u00e0 de son \u00e9migration \u00e0 la Barbade conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)a). La premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie couvre donc du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2001 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001 \u00e0 savoir la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la d\u00e9claration de revenus produite par la Fiducie au Canada pour sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition.\n[21] Sur la seconde question en litige, l\u2019appelant soutient qu\u2019il est faux de pr\u00e9tendre que la Fiducie n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de contrepartie suffisante en \u00e9change de la distribution des sommes d\u2019argent \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Selon lui, il faut appliquer les m\u00eames conclusions, mutatis mutandis, que celles de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Eyeball Networks [4] lorsqu\u2019elle a eu \u00e0 se pencher sur la question de savoir si un rachat d\u2019actions constituait un transfert au sens du paragraphe 160(1) LIR.\n[22] Selon l\u2019appelant, les deux distributions effectu\u00e9es par la Fiducie en faveur de l\u2019appelant en 2004 et 2005 constituent des attributions de capital par le biais d\u2019une fiducie personnelle au sens du paragraphe 107(2) LIR. Ainsi, la LIR cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption irr\u00e9fragable que la Fiducie a re\u00e7u une contribution ad\u00e9quate en \u00e9change des sommes distribu\u00e9es au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la Fiducie lorsque certaines conditions sont remplies, comme ce serait le cas ici.\n[23] L\u2019appelant est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 contester la Cotisation sous-jacente \u00e9mise \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la Fiducie, comme l\u2019ont reconnu les tribunaux \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises [5]. Si l\u2019appelant est en mesure de contester cette cotisation, l\u2019appel devra \u00eatre accueilli, puisque l\u2019une des conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 160(1) LIR requiert que \u00ab l'auteur du transfert doit \u00eatre tenu de payer des imp\u00f4ts en vertu de la Loi au moment de ce transfert \u00bb [6].\n[24] La Cour rappelle que le fardeau de la preuve, en mati\u00e8re fiscale, appartient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l'appelant. L'appelant supporte le fardeau de d\u00e9molir les pr\u00e9somptions de fait de la Ministre, et doit prouver, selon la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, les faits qui supportent sa position que la cotisation contest\u00e9e est mal fond\u00e9e [7]. Cela \u00e9tant dit, le fardeau de preuve n\u2019est en aucun cas d\u00e9terminant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve des faits \u00e9tant secondaire aux questions de droit.\nV. Analyse\nA. Dispositions pertinentes de la LIR\n[25] Lors de l\u2019audience de cette affaire, les parties se sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 quatre dispositions de la LIR, qui sont reproduits en annexe telles qu\u2019elles se lisaient au moment de leur application aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (Annexe B). Il s\u2019agit des paragraphes 94(1), 107(2), 128.1(4) et 160(1) LIR.\nB. Question 1 en litige : changement de r\u00e9sidence de la Fiducie\n[26] Le changement de fiduciaire en date du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 a entrain\u00e9 \u00e0 cette date un changement de r\u00e9sidence de la Fiducie o\u00f9 se trouve son centre de gestion et de contr\u00f4le. \u00c0 cette date, la Fiducie quitte le Canada pour \u00e9migrer \u00e0 la Barbade. Ce constat n\u2019est pas en soi disput\u00e9 par les parties. Le point central de la probl\u00e9matique que pose la premi\u00e8re question en litige est plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si la Fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e aux fins de la LIR avoir une fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition au moment de son \u00e9migration \u00e0 la Barbade en raison du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a) LIR, ou si le paragraphe 94(1) LIR exerce une pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a (4)a) de l\u2019article 128.1 de sorte que la r\u00e9sidence de la Fiducie au Canada est maintenue \u00e0 toutes fins que de droits sans entrainer par ailleurs une fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e r\u00e9put\u00e9e. Cette d\u00e9termination permet ainsi d\u2019\u00e9tablir si l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada \u00e9tait en droit de fixer une fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie en date du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et pr\u00e9sumer d\u2019une disposition des biens de la Fiducie \u00e0 ce moment telle que refl\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cotisation sous-jacente.\n[27] Le paragraphe 94(1) LIR a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019affaire Fundy Settlement [8], qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, confirm\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [9] r\u00e9sumait comme suit le r\u00e9gime cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le paragraphe 94(1) :\n[6] Le paragraphe 94(1) [\u2026] de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu concerne sp\u00e9cialement les fiducies qui ne r\u00e9sident pas au Canada. Cette disposition s\u2019applique, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, aux cas r\u00e9unissant certaines conditions quant \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la fiducie [\u2026] et quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont la fiducie a acquis les biens en question [\u2026]\n[9] Si les conditions r\u00e9pondant aux crit\u00e8res du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et de la contribution sont r\u00e9unies et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une fiducie \u00e0 pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire [\u2026], aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)c), la fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre une personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada aux fins de la partie I de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et de diverses dispositions de la partie XIV imposant certaines obligations en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9clarations [\u2026]. C\u2019est \u00e0 la partie I de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu que se trouvent les principales dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu imposant des responsabilit\u00e9s, y compris l\u2019article 2, selon lequel toute personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada est impos\u00e9e sur ses revenus quelle qu\u2019en soit l\u2019origine g\u00e9ographique. [\u2026]\n[28] Le paragraphe 94(1) LIR est un moyen pour l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien de cr\u00e9er une pr\u00e9somption que certaines fiducies sont r\u00e9sidentes canadiennes \u00e0 des fins fiscales nomm\u00e9es, alors que nonobstant ce paragraphe, elles ne le seraient pas. Cette pr\u00e9somption a donc pour effet d\u2019assujettir ces fiducies \u00e0 des obligations en mati\u00e8re fiscale canadienne qu\u2019elles n\u2019auraient pas assum\u00e9es autrement [10].\n[29] Pour sa part, le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR provoque un certain nombre de cons\u00e9quences dans le cas de l\u2019\u00e9migration d\u2019un contribuable. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la toute premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9somption au paragraphe est pertinente. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a) a pour effet de r\u00e9puter l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition d\u2019une fiducie, alors en cours, se terminer imm\u00e9diatement avant le moment de la cessation de r\u00e9sidence de la fiducie au Canada et une nouvelle ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition avoir commenc\u00e9 au moment de la cessation de la r\u00e9sidence au Canada. Une disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e des biens (hormis les exceptions not\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article) de la fiducie se produit au dernier moment de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e s\u2019\u00eatre termin\u00e9e [11]. Le paragraphe 128.1(4) n\u2019a pas pour but de d\u00e9terminer le statut de non-r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un contribuable, ce statut est plut\u00f4t une condition d\u2019ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019application du paragraphe.\n[30] Le m\u00e9canisme au paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR a notamment pour effet de cr\u00e9er un imp\u00f4t de d\u00e9part que le contribuable vis\u00e9 doit payer sur ses gains latents, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, lors de son \u00e9migration hors du Canada. Par la suite, pour la nouvelle ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) ou a.1), selon le cas, la LIR est susceptible d\u2019imposer au contribuable vis\u00e9 d\u2019autres obligations ou cons\u00e9quences. Il doit \u00eatre not\u00e9 en outre que les r\u00e8gles impos\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 128.1(4) s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la LIR, sans mention par ailleurs que cette application soit sujette \u00e0 une disposition expresse contraire pr\u00e9vue par ailleurs.\n[31] \u00c0 la seule lecture des paragraphes 94(1) et 128.1(4) LIR, la Cour note que le paragraphe 128.1(4) ne d\u00e9termine pas le statut de r\u00e9sidence, mais requiert plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un statut de non-r\u00e9sident survienne \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 pour permettre son application. Une fois que ce changement de statut se produit \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, le paragraphe engendre une s\u00e9rie de cons\u00e9quences visant \u00e0 la fois l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition avant ce moment donn\u00e9 et l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition apr\u00e8s ce moment donn\u00e9. L\u2019existence du moment donn\u00e9 est donc d\u00e9cisive tant aux fins du paragraphe lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 toute autre fin de la LIR.\n[32] En ce qui concerne le paragraphe 94(1) LIR, et plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) aux fins du pr\u00e9sent appel [12], la Cour note que l\u2019alin\u00e9a ne d\u00e9termine pas le statut de r\u00e9sidence de la fiducie, mais que, dans les deux situations qui y sont d\u00e9crites, la fiducie ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9e de la fiducie. Et situation encore plus importante, l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) ne d\u00e9termine pas non plus l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la fiducie \u00e0 laquelle il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence si ce n\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la fiducie, au cours de laquelle, la fiducie ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada. Pour la Cour, le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) supporte que l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9e de la fiducie est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par ailleurs en vertu d\u2019une autre disposition de la LIR.\n[33] Aux fins de la d\u00e9finition d\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 249(1)c) LIR stipule qu\u2019aux fins de la LIR, sauf disposition contraire expresse, l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition d\u2019une fiducie entre vifs correspond \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile.\n[34] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il est admis qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 la Fiducie est devenue non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada. Nous savons \u00e9galement que sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une disposition expresse contraire, le paragraphe 249(1) LIR d\u00e9termine l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition d\u2019une fiducie \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile. Mais nous savons \u00e9galement que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a) LIR, \u00e9tant une disposition de la LIR applicable pour toutes les fins de la LIR, d\u00e9termine l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition d\u2019un contribuable (incluant une fiducie entre vifs) se terminer \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 et que ce moment peut donc \u00eatre un moment autre que le dernier moment d\u2019une ann\u00e9e civile. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut \u00eatre exclu que l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)a) r\u00e9f\u00e8re soit une tout autre ann\u00e9e qu\u2019une ann\u00e9e civile en raison d\u2019une disposition expresse contraire contenue dans la LIR, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a). Tout ce que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)a) requiert par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9e est que la fiducie ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada au cours de cette ann\u00e9e.\n[35] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)a) LIR n\u2019est pas plus ou moins exigeant ou sp\u00e9cifique quant \u00e0 la signification de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui y est vis\u00e9e. Et pour que la Fiducie soit assujettie au paragraphe 94(1), elle doit \u00eatre devenue non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada : \u00ab \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 d'une ann\u00e9e d'imposition d'une fiducie qui ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada, ou qui, sans l'alin\u00e9a c), n'y r\u00e9siderait pas \u00bb.\n[36] De plus, en lien avec la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9e aux fins du paragraphe 94(1), la LIR ne contient aucune mention qui force \u00e0 ignorer la port\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la loi ou de devoir consid\u00e9rer un r\u00e9gime d\u2019exception ayant pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur toute autre r\u00e8gle.\n[37] Dans un tel contexte, il ne semble pas possible de conclure \u00e0 bon droit que le paragraphe 94(1) LIR peut constituer une sorte de disposition ayant pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR notamment aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie. En fait, le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 94(1) ne pr\u00e9sente pas d\u2019obstacle au paragraphe 128.1(4) de s\u2019appliquer d\u2019abord. Cette application successive des dispositions apparait en fait trac\u00e9e.\n[38] Relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie, le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR intervient et exerce une pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le paragraphe 249(1) LIR aux fins de d\u00e9terminer la fin d\u2019une ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition et le d\u00e9but d\u2019une autre ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie. Les conditions d\u2019application du paragraphe 94(1) LIR sont par la suite appliqu\u00e9es quant \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 94(1) \u00e0 savoir l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition au cours de laquelle la Fiducie ne r\u00e9side pas au Canada. Une telle situation ne peut que concerner la nouvelle ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 128.1(4)a) puisqu\u2019en aucun temps la Fiducie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 non-r\u00e9sidente du Canada au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition se terminant imm\u00e9diatement avant le moment donn\u00e9 o\u00f9 la Fiducie a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider au Canada. Les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019article 94 sont donc relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie qui d\u00e9bute au moment o\u00f9 elle cesse de r\u00e9sider au Canada.\n[39] Selon l\u2019appelant, le paragraphe 94(1) LIR s\u2019applique de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer un statut de r\u00e9sidence en quelque sorte continu \u00e0 la Fiducie et ainsi \u00e9viter l\u2019application du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait jamais quitt\u00e9 le Canada aux fins de la loi. Cette lecture de la loi n\u2019est pas soutenable. Apr\u00e8s analyse, la Cour n\u2019a d\u2019autre choix malheureusement que de croire que la position de l\u2019appelant a pour effet d\u2019ajouter des mots au paragraphe 94(1). Le changement de r\u00e9sidence aura n\u00e9cessairement entrain\u00e9 l\u2019application du paragraphe 128.1(4), qui s\u2019applique automatiquement aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il y a changement de r\u00e9sidence. La port\u00e9e de ce paragraphe s\u2019\u00e9tend ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(1)a) pour connaitre l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition vis\u00e9e.\n[40] La Cour est d\u2019avis que si le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu \u00e9carter l\u2019application du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR par l\u2019effet de 94(1) LIR, il l\u2019aurait fait. Le libell\u00e9 ne laisse pas place \u00e0 une application ou une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente. Le fait que l\u00e9gislateur ait modifi\u00e9 l\u2019article 94 par la suite pour exclure explicitement l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que tente de faire valoir l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation auquel doit se livrer la Cour [13].\n[41] Au terme d\u2019une analyse textuelle des deux dispositions et des autres dispositions pertinentes de la LIR, il apparait \u00e0 la Cour que le texte \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur est clair. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 et analys\u00e9 autant la version anglaise que la version fran\u00e7aise des dispositions, qui sont d\u2019ailleurs au m\u00eame effet, la Cour ne rel\u00e8ve aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 notable et n\u2019est pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure de la mani\u00e8re soumise par l\u2019appelant.\n[42] Selon les enseignements de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un libell\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis et non \u00e9quivoque dans une loi aussi d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, complexe et exhaustive que la LIR, le sens ordinaire des mots joue un r\u00f4le primordial dans le processus d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, au profit par exemple du contexte ou de l\u2019objet de la disposition [14]. En effet, le degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cision et de clart\u00e9 du libell\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition fiscale influe sur la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Lorsque le sens d\u2019une telle disposition ou son application aux faits ne pr\u00e9sente pas d\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, il suffit de l\u2019appliquer [15].\n[43] Cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter des deux dispositions est \u00e9galement en accord avec les enseignements de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada que l\u2019on doit, dans la mesure du possible, interpr\u00e9ter la loi applicable comme formant un tout harmonieux [16].\n[44] Toutefois, la Cour juge pertinent de tout de m\u00eame de se pencher plus en profondeur sur le contexte et l\u2019objet des deux dispositions afin d\u2019appliquer convenablement la m\u00e9thode moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation mise de l\u2019avant \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. En effet, la Cour supr\u00eame rappelle que \u00ab m\u00eame lorsque le sens de certaines dispositions peut para\u00eetre non ambigu \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, le contexte et l\u2019objet de la loi peuvent r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ou dissiper des ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s latentes \u00bb et que \u00ab pour relever et dissiper toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 latente du sens des dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, les tribunaux doivent adopter une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative textuelle, contextuelle et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique unifi\u00e9e \u00bb [17].\n[45] Cependant, malheureusement pour l\u2019appelant, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, une analyse du contexte et de l\u2019objet des dispositions renforce l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation textuelle not\u00e9e plus haut.\n[46] Les deux dispositions se trouvent dans la Partie I de la LIR qui concerne l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Le paragraphe 94(1) LIR se trouve dans la Sous-section I \u2013 \u00ab Actionnaires de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ne r\u00e9sidant pas au Canada \u00bb de la Section B \u2013 \u00ab Calcul du revenu \u00bb. Ce contexte pointe vers l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Fiducie doit \u00eatre devenue \u00e0 tout le moins non-r\u00e9sidente avant que l\u2019article 94 ne puisse s\u2019appliquer. Le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR se trouve quant \u00e0 lui dans la Section F \u2013 \u00ab R\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales applicables en certains cas \u00bb. La Section F suit entre autres la Section E \u2013 \u00ab Calcul de l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00bb. Ce contexte nous indique que ce dernier paragraphe cr\u00e9e un imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial notamment en cas d\u2019\u00e9migration d\u2019un contribuable canadien. L\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 de l\u2019article 128.1 est d\u2019ailleurs consacr\u00e9e au changement de r\u00e9sidence d\u2019un contribuable. Lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur cr\u00e9e un imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial et inclut une disposition sp\u00e9cifique et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dans la LIR \u00e0 cet effet, il faudra selon la Cour une mention quelque peu explicite pour exclure son application dans une situation factuelle pr\u00e9cise qui autrement est vis\u00e9e par cet imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial. Une telle conclusion est d\u2019autant plus vraie si le libell\u00e9, comme au paragraphe 128.1(4), \u00e9vite en fait une telle possible ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en pr\u00e9cisant express\u00e9ment l\u2019application du paragraphe 128.1(4) aux fins de toute la LIR. Une telle pr\u00e9cision, dans un sens comme dans l\u2019autre, n\u2019existe pas au libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 94 sous \u00e9tude.\n[47] Autrement dit, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019appelant donne un r\u00e9sultat contraire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration de deux dispositions de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner pleine mesure aux deux dispositions. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019appelant cr\u00e9e une distorsion qui n\u2019est pas conforme au texte l\u00e9gislatif du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR, qui confirme s\u2019appliquer aux fins de la LIR, et n\u2019invite pas (pas plus que le paragraphe 94(1) LIR) \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 par le jeu d\u2019une exception qu\u2019un traitement fiscal autre puisse avoir pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance advenant une \u00e9migration.\n[48] Ensuite, de par ses effets, on peut d\u00e9duire que l\u2019objet du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR est de cristalliser et imposer les gains r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par un contribuable alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au Canada avant qu\u2019il ne quitte pour une autre juridiction. Rien de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience ne permet de conclure que l\u2019objet du paragraphe 94(1) LIR \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9carter cette cristallisation des gains. Au contraire, l\u2019objet du paragraphe 94(1) est d\u2019ajouter un imp\u00f4t suppl\u00e9mentaire canadien au revenu passif des fiducies qui seraient habituellement exempt\u00e9es d\u2019imp\u00f4ts canadiens en raison de leur r\u00e9sidence. Ce n\u2019est donc pas une mesure d\u2019all\u00e8gement fiscal, et ce n\u2019est pas non plus une mesure de remplacement \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial lors d\u2019une \u00e9migration.\n[49] Une lecture des notes explicatives \u00e9manant du minist\u00e8re des Finances [18] r\u00e9dig\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la modification en 2003 de l\u2019article 94 LIR [19] supporte que l\u2019objet de cette disposition ait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab d\u2019\u00e9noncer les r\u00e8gles d\u2019imposition du revenu passif de certaines fiducies non-r\u00e9sidentes \u00bb et qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique \u00ab lorsqu\u2019une personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ou pr\u00eat\u00e9 des biens \u00e0 une fiducie non r\u00e9sidente dont au moins un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire r\u00e9side au Canada \u00bb. Encore une fois, il semble que pour pouvoir s\u2019appliquer, l\u2019article 94 requiert que la Fiducie soit devenue non-r\u00e9sidente.\n[50] Rien n\u2019indique non plus que l\u2019objectif du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de permettre aux fiducies comme la Fiducie de quitter le Canada en \u00e9vitant l\u2019imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial en cas d\u2019\u00e9migration d\u00e9clench\u00e9 par le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR. Au contraire, une lecture du communiqu\u00e9 diffus\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Finances le 2 octobre 1996 et intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Resserrement des r\u00e8gles sur l\u2019imposition des migrants \u00bb [20] indique que la volont\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019assujettir plus d\u2019\u00e9migrants \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sp\u00e9cial, \u00ab fiducies comprises \u00bb.\n[51] Ainsi, autant le contexte que l\u2019objet des dispositions appuient la lecture et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui d\u00e9coule de la lecture du texte clair et non ambigu de la LIR en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[52] Pour ces raisons, la Cour est d\u2019avis que le paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR s\u2019est bel et bien appliqu\u00e9 lorsque la Fiducie a \u00e9migr\u00e9 vers la Barbade, entrainant ainsi les cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9crites au paragraphe. La Cour conclut que sur la base de la position avanc\u00e9e de l\u2019appelant eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la Cotisation sous-jacente, cette derni\u00e8re est bien-fond\u00e9 en ce que l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition de la Fiducie se terminant le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2001 est valide conform\u00e9ment notamment aux dispositions du paragraphe 128.1(4) LIR.\nC. Question 2 en litige : la contrepartie donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Fiducie\n[53] Dans la d\u00e9cision Eyeball Networks, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit le r\u00e9gime cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le paragraphe 160(1) LIR :\n[2] Le paragraphe 160(1) dispose que, dans le cas d\u2019un transfert de biens entre personnes ayant un lien de d\u00e9pendance, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et l\u2019auteur du transfert sont solidairement responsables de toute somme payable par l\u2019auteur du transfert en application de la Loi pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition au cours de laquelle le transfert a eu lieu et les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 160(1)e), le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert est responsable du paiement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de l\u2019exc\u00e9dent de la juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s sur la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie offerte. Cette disposition s\u2019applique m\u00eame si l\u2019auteur ou le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert ignoraient l\u2019existence d\u2019une dette fiscale au moment du transfert.\n[54] Plusieurs conditions doivent \u00eatre remplies pour que le paragraphe 160(1) LIR s\u2019applique. Ces conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reprises dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Livingston de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019une de ces conditions est que la juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019auteur du transfert exc\u00e8de la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie donn\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert [21]. Autrement dit, sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 160(1), le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d'un transfert de biens est redevable \u00e0 l'Agence du revenu du Canada dans la mesure o\u00f9 la juste valeur marchande de la contrepartie qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9e pour les biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande de ces derniers [22]. \u00c0 ce m\u00eame paragraphe de la d\u00e9cision dans Livingston, le juge Sexton ajoute :\n\u2026 L'objet m\u00eame du paragraphe 160(1) est d'assurer la conservation de la valeur des biens existants dans le patrimoine du contribuable [l\u2019auteur du transfert] aux fins de recouvrement par l'ARC. Dans le cas o\u00f9 le contribuable s'est enti\u00e8rement dessaisi de ces biens, le paragraphe 160(1) pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 pour l'ARC d'exercer ses droits sur lesdits biens contre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de leur transfert. Cependant, ce paragraphe n'est pas d'application lorsque l'auteur du transfert a re\u00e7u au moment de celui\u2011ci une somme \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la valeur des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s, c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire une contrepartie \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande. La raison en est qu'une telle transaction ne l\u00e8se pas l'ARC en tant que cr\u00e9ancier. \u2026\n[55] Selon l\u2019appelant, cette condition n\u2019est pas remplie, puisqu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 une contrepartie lors des deux distributions qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues de la Fiducie et dont la valeur est \u00e9gale au produit de la distribution. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il soutient que l\u2019application du paragraphe 107(2) LIR entraine trois cons\u00e9quences : 1) la Fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir dispos\u00e9 de ses biens et en avoir tir\u00e9 un produit de disposition \u00e9gal au co\u00fbt indiqu\u00e9; 2) le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est r\u00e9put\u00e9 les avoir acquis \u00e0 ce co\u00fbt; et 3) le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir dispos\u00e9 d\u2019une partie ou de la totalit\u00e9 de sa participation et d\u2019en avoir retir\u00e9 un produit \u00e9gal au co\u00fbt pour lequel il est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir acquis les biens de la Fiducie. De ce constat, il conclut que le paragraphe 107(2) \u00e9tablit clairement qu\u2019en \u00e9change de la distribution de capital par la Fiducie, le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir dispos\u00e9 de sa participation au capital au m\u00eame co\u00fbt, de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quivalente.\n[56] Ainsi, l\u2019appelant avance que la condition du paragraphe 160(1) LIR relative \u00e0 la contrepartie donn\u00e9e au moment du transfert doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la troisi\u00e8me cons\u00e9quence du paragraphe 107(2) LIR, soit celle qui \u00e9tablit que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir dispos\u00e9 d\u2019une partie ou de la totalit\u00e9 de sa participation. Ainsi, il faut d\u00e9terminer si cette disposition r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande des biens transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la Fiducie.\n[57] Il pr\u00e9cise que cette interpr\u00e9tation ne serait pas contraire \u00e0 l\u2019objet du paragraphe 160(1) LIR puisque l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada ne perdrait pas son droit de recouvrement en raison de la m\u00e9canique de transfert avec report d\u2019imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 107(2) LIR. Son droit de recouvrement serait simplement report\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire disposera des biens.\n(a) Notion de contrepartie donn\u00e9e aux fins de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 160(1)e) LIR\n[58] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 160(1)e) LIR r\u00e9f\u00e8re d\u2019abord \u00e0 un transfert de bien de l\u2019auteur du transfert au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert, et r\u00e9f\u00e8re ensuite \u00e0 une contrepartie donn\u00e9e pour le bien \u00e0 l\u2019auteur du transfert par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a eu transfert de biens de la Fiducie \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. La notion de transfert est centrale aux fins du paragraphe 160(1) en raison de sa qualit\u00e9 de condition sine qua non \u00e0 l\u2019application de la disposition. Dans ce contexte, il est pertinent de bien comprendre le sens du mot transfert, puisque c\u2019est dans cette perspective que doive \u00eatre analys\u00e9e la port\u00e9e de la contrepartie donn\u00e9e.\n[59] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kieboom [23], la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a donn\u00e9 son avis sur le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab transfert de biens \u00bb qui figurait dans une autre disposition de la Loi :\n\u00c0 mon avis, l'expression \u00abtransfert de biens\u00bb est employ\u00e9e dans cette disposition dans un sens plut\u00f4t large. Les deux substantifs de cette expression sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et n'ont pas de sens technique. Quant au mot \u00abtransfert\u00bb, le lord juge James a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 7 de l'arr\u00eat Gathercole v. Smith (1880-81), 17 Ch. D. 1 (C.A.) que le substantif \u00abtransfert\u00bb est [TRADUCTION] \u00ab l'un des termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que l'on puisse employer \u00bb. Le lord juge Lush a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [\u00e0 la page 9] que le mot \u00ab transf\u00e9rable \u00bb comprend [TRADUCTION] \u00ab tout moyen par lequel un bien peut \u00eatre transmis d'une personne \u00e0 une autre \u00bb.\nLe pr\u00e9sident Thorson, se fondant sur les d\u00e9finitions pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es dans le jugement Fasken, David v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] R.C.\u00c9. 580, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 592 :\n[TRADUCTION] Le mot \u00abtransfert\u00bb n'est pas un terme technique. Pour qu'il y ait transfert d'un bien d'un mari \u00e0 sa femme, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il soit fait selon une forme particuli\u00e8re ni qu'il soit fait directement. Il suffit que le contribuable se d\u00e9partisse du bien et le remette \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il lui transmette le bien. Le moyen employ\u00e9 pour atteindre ce r\u00e9sultat, qu'il soit direct ou indirect, peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre appel\u00e9 un transfert.\n[60] Dans Damis Properties [24], d\u00e9cision renvers\u00e9e en appel [25], mais confirm\u00e9e sur ce point, notre Cour a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la jurisprudence de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur ce point de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[131] Ensuite, la Cour rejette la classification \u00e9troite des biens en cause par M. Kieboom comme \u00e9tant des actions particuli\u00e8res de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cela m\u2019indique que plut\u00f4t que de tenter de retracer un bien particulier, il faut consid\u00e9rer toutes les circonstances et d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019il existe un lien entre la diminution du bien d\u2019une personne et l\u2019augmentation du bien d\u2019une autre personne. Telle est l\u2019approche consacr\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision Kieboom et par l\u2019arr\u00eat Medland.\n[Notre soulignement.]\n[61] On doit retenir plusieurs choses de ces extraits de jurisprudence. D\u2019abord, la notion de transfert envisag\u00e9e \u00e0 ce paragraphe est un transfert dans le sens \u00e9conomique du terme. On parle d\u2019un transfert de valeur \u00e9conomique d\u2019une partie \u00e0 une autre. Aussi, ce transfert peut prendre des formes infinies. Ce qui compte, c\u2019est de d\u00e9terminer, au terme de l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9tapes du transfert et en comparant le patrimoine des parties impliqu\u00e9es avant et apr\u00e8s le transfert, si la valeur de chacun des patrimoines a augment\u00e9 ou diminu\u00e9. S\u2019il existe un lien raisonnable entre l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019un et la diminution de l\u2019autre, alors on pourra conclure \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un transfert.\n[62] Cette question plus large de transfert, du sens ordinaire et non technique du mot et l\u2019importance du r\u00f4le de transfert \u00e9conomique au paragraphe 160(1) LIR teintent \u00e9galement le sens qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 160(1)e) o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 une contrepartie donn\u00e9e pour le bien re\u00e7u au moment du transfert. En effet, d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019une partie s\u2019enrichit et que l\u2019autre s\u2019appauvrit d\u2019autant, il sera possible de conclure que la partie qui s\u2019est enrichie n\u2019a pas offert de contrepartie \u00e9quivalente; sinon, la valeur de son patrimoine demeurerait la m\u00eame. Ainsi, dans un contexte o\u00f9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert s\u2019enrichit et l\u2019auteur du transfert s\u2019appauvrit, il devient difficile de fermer les yeux sur l\u2019accomplissement de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 160(1)e). L\u2019aspect \u00e9conomique repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un \u00e9cart de juste valeur marchande entre le bien transf\u00e9r\u00e9 et la contrepartie donn\u00e9e joue un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant.\n(b) Les rapports juridiques entre la Fiducie et l\u2019appelant-b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire\n[63] Pour appliquer le cadre juridique mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est essentiel de bien d\u00e9finir les rapports juridiques intervenus entre la Fiducie et l\u2019appelant. Cet exercice commence par l\u2019\u00e9tude de l\u2019acte de fiducie.\n[64] Les parties conviennent que l\u2019acte de fiducie cr\u00e9e une fiducie personnelle discr\u00e9tionnaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019aucun droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire dans la Fiducie n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis pour une contrepartie \u00e0 payer directement ou indirectement et que son fiduciaire a le pouvoir de distribuer \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion les biens de la Fiducie \u00e0 l\u2019un ou des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe A de l\u2019acte de fiducie et dans n\u2019importe quelle proportion. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ont donc un droit d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s lors de toute distribution par le fiduciaire, mais n\u2019ont droit \u00e0 aucune somme \u00e0 proprement parler sans une d\u00e9cision unilat\u00e9rale du fiduciaire. L\u2019acte de fiducie ne distingue pas les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires entre les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du revenu et du capital.\n[65] L\u2019acte de fiducie ne limite pas le nombre de distributions que le fiduciaire peut consentir \u00e0 un ou plusieurs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ou le moment o\u00f9 de telles distributions peuvent survenir. Les droits des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires \u00e0 l\u2019acte de fiducie ne sont entach\u00e9s d\u2019aucune limitation en ce que leurs droits demeurent entiers tout au long o\u00f9 ces derniers demeurent des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la Fiducie. Autrement dit, les droits des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ne sont pas ali\u00e9n\u00e9s ou r\u00e9duits ou encore \u00e9teints partiellement durant la vie de la Fiducie, en pr\u00e9sence ou non de distributions par le fiduciaire. Bien que la valeur \u00e9conomique d\u2019une participation aux yeux de son b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut varier, les distributions du fiduciaire n\u2019ont aucun impact sur les droits d\u2019un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la Fiducie ayant re\u00e7u ou non une distribution.\n[66] Deux autres sources fondamentales dans le pr\u00e9sent cas sont les r\u00e9solutions adopt\u00e9es par le fiduciaire de la Fiducie lors de chacune des deux distributions vers\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en date du 8 janvier 2004 et 30 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Dans la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9solution, le fiduciaire exerce sa discr\u00e9tion de verser la somme de 2 250 000$ \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. On ne fait mention d\u2019aucune contrepartie vers\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me, le fiduciaire exerce une fois de plus sa discr\u00e9tion de verser le solde des actifs de la Fiducie \u00e0 l\u2019appelant seulement. On ne parle pas de contrepartie. Toutefois, dans cette deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9solution de distribution, il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois les biens distribu\u00e9s, on mettra un terme \u00e0 la Fiducie, puisque la Fiducie ne sera plus n\u00e9cessaire. Ces deux distributions sont qualifi\u00e9es de distributions en capital.\n[67] De ces deux documents, on peut conclure un certain nombre de choses. D\u2019abord, avant que les r\u00e9solutions soient adopt\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant poss\u00e9dait un droit dans la Fiducie d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par le fiduciaire pour toute distribution au m\u00eame titre que les autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires [26]. La valeur de ce droit n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e, et rien ne porte \u00e0 croire que quiconque aurait pay\u00e9 ne serait-ce qu\u2019une tr\u00e8s faible somme pour ce droit. \u00c0 vrai dire, il est plut\u00f4t tr\u00e8s improbable qu\u2019un tel droit puisse \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers [27]. Ensuite, les r\u00e9solutions ne font \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune contrepartie vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la Fiducie. Ces r\u00e9solutions sont un acte discr\u00e9tionnaire et unilat\u00e9ral du fiduciaire de la Fiducie charg\u00e9 d\u2019assurer l\u2019administration de la Fiducie, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un \u00e9change entre deux parties.\n[68] Au terme de la premi\u00e8re distribution, l\u2019appelant poss\u00e8de toujours les m\u00eames droits dans la Fiducie comme tout autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire (ses droits n\u2019ont pas chang\u00e9), mais en plus, son patrimoine s\u2019est enrichi d\u2019une somme de 2 250 000$. Son enrichissement est direct. Pour ce qui est de la Fiducie, son appauvrissement est corr\u00e9latif. Elle a toujours les m\u00eames obligations, mais son patrimoine s\u2019est appauvri de 2 250 000$. \u00c0 elle seule, cette distribution est suffisante pour couvrir l\u2019ensemble de la dette fiscale aux fins du paragraphe 160(1) LIR.\n[69] Pour ce qui est de la deuxi\u00e8me distribution, la situation est exactement la m\u00eame. Le fait que le fiduciaire ait mis un terme \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la Fiducie une fois cette distribution compl\u00e9t\u00e9e ne change rien au fait que les distributions se soient fait unilat\u00e9ralement, sans que l\u2019appelant ne verse quoi que ce soit \u00e0 la Fiducie pour obtenir les sommes vers\u00e9es. L\u2019ensemble des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires (incluant l\u2019appelant) demeureront b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la Fiducie jusqu\u2019au dernier moment o\u00f9 la Fiducie s\u2019\u00e9teindra.\n[70] L\u2019appelant avait le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 la Cour qu\u2019il avait vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la Fiducie une contrepartie en \u00e9change des distributions. Cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il se soit appauvri par l\u2019extinction de l\u2019un de ses droits. Il n\u2019est pas pertinent de se livrer \u00e0 un exercice de sp\u00e9culation sur ce que les rapports \u00e9tablis auraient pu \u00eatre : le droit fiscal est un droit de cons\u00e9quence qui se base sur les rapports r\u00e9els entre les parties [28], et ici, en vue de la preuve au dossier, la Cour conclut que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a vers\u00e9 aucune contrepartie \u00e0 la Fiducie.\n(c) La position de l\u2019appelant en lien avec Eyeball Networks\n[71] Il est opportun \u00e0 ce stade de discuter de l\u2019analogie que l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9sente entre les faits de sa cause et les faits de l\u2019affaire Eyeball Networks qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. La d\u00e9cision Eyeball Networks met en sc\u00e8ne une s\u00e9rie de transactions qui impliquaient le rachat d\u2019actions. La Cour d\u2019appel, dans le cadre de cette affaire, a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 certains principes applicables \u00e0 la possible application du paragraphe 160(1) LIR au rachat d\u2019actions.\n[72] La Cour voit difficilement de quelle fa\u00e7on une distribution de capital dont l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire serait assimilable \u00e0 un rachat d\u2019actions. Lors d\u2019un rachat d\u2019action, il est ind\u00e9niable que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 rach\u00e8te quelque chose \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire : les actions. Avant le rachat, l\u2019actionnaire poss\u00e8de une action avec une certaine valeur. L\u2019actionnaire redonne ses actions pour obtenir la valeur offerte par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les actions quittent le patrimoine de l\u2019actionnaire.\n[73] Or, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une distribution ne signifie pas que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire se soit d\u00e9parti de son actif qu\u2019est sa participation dans la Fiducie. Sa participation et ses droits dans la Fiducie demeurent entiers. L\u2019appelant est b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la Fiducie avant la distribution et demeure avec les m\u00eames droits b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la Fiducie apr\u00e8s la distribution. La distribution n\u2019a aucun impact sur les droits intrins\u00e8ques reconnus \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la Fiducie. L\u2019appelant ne s\u2019est d\u00e9parti lors des distributions d\u2019aucun bien ni d\u2019aucun droit qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Son patrimoine ne s\u2019est pas appauvri de quelque bien que ce soit; il s\u2019est tout simplement unilat\u00e9ralement enrichi aux d\u00e9pens de celui de la Fiducie. Ceci n\u2019est certes pas un reproche puisque la finalit\u00e9 de la fiducie entre vifs inclut dans plusieurs situations un tel r\u00e9sultat.\n[74] Si l\u2019on veut se livrer au jeu des comparaisons avec le r\u00e9gime corporatif, la distribution de la Fiducie s\u2019assimile beaucoup plus \u00e0 un versement de dividende qu\u2019\u00e0 un rachat d\u2019action, sans que ce parall\u00e8le soit exact. Dans les deux cas, une entit\u00e9 verse unilat\u00e9ralement une partie de ses biens \u00e0 une autre personne sans que cette personne ne se d\u00e9partisse de quoi que ce soit. Dans les deux cas, avant que l\u2019entit\u00e9 proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de distribuer, le titulaire du droit ne peut exiger g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le versement de quelque somme que ce soit. Or, le versement de dividende a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 par notre Cour ainsi que par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme un versement effectu\u00e9 sans contrepartie aux fins du paragraphe 160(1) LIR [29].\n[75] Dans ce contexte, malheureusement pour l\u2019appelant, la d\u00e9cision Eyeball Networks n\u2019est d\u2019aucun secours.\n(d) La position de l\u2019appelant en lien avec le paragraphe 107(2) LIR\n[76] Selon l\u2019appelant, malgr\u00e9 les conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la Fiducie est tout de m\u00eame r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir re\u00e7u une contrepartie suffisante par le jeu de la pr\u00e9somption du paragraphe 107(2) LIR, et cette pr\u00e9somption est applicable dans le cas d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9mise en vertu du paragraphe 160(1) LIR.\n[77] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le paragraphe 107(2) LIR pr\u00e9voit le roulement des biens d'une fiducie personnelle \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du capital de cette derni\u00e8re de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 reporter l\u2019imp\u00f4t payable sur cette op\u00e9ration dans certaines circonstances [30]. L\u2019intim\u00e9 semble conc\u00e9der que cet article s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019une des cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019application de cette disposition \u00e0 une distribution de biens par une fiducie est que \u00ab la fiducie est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir dispos\u00e9 de ces biens et en avoir tir\u00e9 un produit \u00e9gal au co\u00fbt indiqu\u00e9 de ces biens, pour la fiducie, imm\u00e9diatement avant ce moment \u00bb.\n[78] Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de se pencher davantage sur l\u2019application de cette disposition aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Aucune cons\u00e9quence fiscale ne d\u00e9coule de l\u2019application de ce paragraphe aux fins du pr\u00e9sent cas, et selon la Cour, le traitement fiscal particulier cr\u00e9\u00e9 par cette disposition n\u2019a pas le lien souhait\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant avec l\u2019analyse qui doit \u00eatre faite dans le cadre d\u2019une cotisation \u00e9tablie sous le paragraphe 160(1) LIR.\n[79] Comme l\u2019a \u00e9tabli la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le mot transfert doit se comprendre dans son sens ordinaire, \u00e9conomique, et non technique ou fiscal. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il y a un transfert de valeur entre deux patrimoines, il y a transfert au sens du paragraphe 160(1) LIR. Le traitement fiscal par ailleurs auquel les parties peuvent \u00eatre assujetties ne change rien \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique et ne saurait cr\u00e9er une contrepartie l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n\u2019y en a pas.\n[80] Si l\u2019on suit la logique de l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant, chaque fois qu\u2019un parent donnerait un bien \u00e0 son enfant, le paragraphe 160(1) serait inapplicable, puisque par le biais de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 69(1)b) LIR, le parent serait r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u une contrepartie \u00e9gale \u00e0 la juste valeur marchande du bien donn\u00e9. Or, c\u2019est l\u2019arch\u00e9type des situations que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait viser avec le paragraphe 160(1) [31]. Il est donc difficilement concevable que le traitement fiscal d\u2019une transaction puisse interagir avec la notion de transfert pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur aux fins du paragraphe 160(1) LIR.\n[81] De toute fa\u00e7on, le texte m\u00eame du paragraphe 107(2) LIR ne supporte pas la port\u00e9e que veut lui donner l\u2019appelant. Le sous-alin\u00e9a 160(1)e)(i) LIR permet que la responsabilit\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du transfert soit limit\u00e9e par \u00ab la contrepartie donn\u00e9e pour le bien \u00bb au moment du transfert. Or, les effets de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 107(2)a) sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s se produire \u00ab imm\u00e9diatement avant ce moment \u00bb, le moment \u00e9tant celui de la distribution. C\u2019est donc une cons\u00e9quence propre au traitement fiscal de la fiducie pour la distribution qui ne vise pas le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Le texte du paragraphe 107(2) n'\u00e9tablit pas que la contrepartie r\u00e9put\u00e9e re\u00e7ue par la fiducie serait vers\u00e9e ou r\u00e9put\u00e9e vers\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 107(2)a) ne fait que r\u00e9puter la fiducie en avoir tir\u00e9 un produit de disposition \u00e9gal au co\u00fbt indiqu\u00e9. Cette pr\u00e9somption n\u2019a qu\u2019une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e au traitement fiscal de la fiducie. L\u2019int\u00e9gration souhait\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant des paragraphes 107(2) et 160(1) fait certes d\u00e9faut.\n[82] Ainsi, le paragraphe 107(2) LIR n\u2019est pas en mesure de porter secours \u00e0 l\u2019appelant lorsqu\u2019il tente d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Fiducie une contrepartie \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la valeur de la distribution au moment de cette distribution.\n[83] La Cour n\u2019a d\u2019autre choix que de conclure que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a vers\u00e9 aucune contrepartie en \u00e9change des distributions qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9es la Fiducie \u00e0 son endroit.\nVI.
