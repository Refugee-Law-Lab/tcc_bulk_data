Notes:

(1) Data Source: [Tax Court of Canada](https://www.tcc-cci.gc.ca). 

(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions of materials on the Tax Court of Canada website. Links to official versions are included in the dataset.

(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Tax Court of Canada.

(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, see the Tax Court of Canada website's [Terms of Use](https://www.tcc-cci.gc.ca/en/pages/important-notices).

(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information. 

(6) Limitation: Only includes cases with neutral citation, which began to be used in 2003

(7) Delay: Decisions may take many months to be translated (sometimes over a year). As a result, in the most recent years, decisions may only be available in one language.
